            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the opinions of the Court to announce in two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.412" offset="17554">And the first of them, Bowen against Kendrick, No. 87-253 and others concerns when in 1981, Congress adopted the AFLA, the American Family Life Act to authorize federal grants to public or private organizations for services and research in the area of premarital adolescent sexual relations and pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.598" offset="118387">The Act provides that grantees must furnish certain types of services to adolescents including various types of counseling and education services.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.269" offset="152973">Congress recognized that the complexity of the problems associated with teenage sexuality requires the involvement of religious and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups in the private sector, as well as government agencies and therefore, emendated that prospective grantees describe how they would involve such organizations including religious organizations and the provisions of service under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.783" offset="255060">The Act also provides that federal funds may not be used for certain purposes including family planning services and the promotion of abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.344" offset="289332">In this case, the District Court here in the District of Columbia ruled that the American Family Life Act was invalid both on its face and as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.594" offset="326322">The Court ruled that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution prevented any involvement by religious organizations in the federally funded programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.616" offset="366446">We now reverse the District Court and hold that the Family Life Act is not invalid on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.319" offset="389224">We apply the three prong standard first announced in Lemon against Kurtzman and hold first that the Act has a valid secular purpose of eliminating or reducing the social and economic problems associated with teenage sexuality, pregnancy, and parenthood.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.541" offset="454113">As of the second prong of Lemon, the effects test, we hold that the Act on its face does not have the primary effect of advancing religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.792" offset="487131">The Act does not require to grantees be affiliated with any religious denomination and the services provided under the Act are not religious in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.899" offset="523494">We have never held that religious organizations are prevented from being involved in the federal grant program that provides aid neutrally to both sectarian and non-sectarian institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.287" offset="569051">Finally, we do not think that the Act violates the entanglement prong of the Lemon test, although monitoring of grantees will be necessary to ensure that public money is spent in the way that Congress intended, and in a way that comports with the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.905" offset="627566">We do not believe that this monitoring is of such a type that will cause the Government to intrude unduly in the day-to-day operations of the religiously affiliated grantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.691" offset="670720">The District Court also struck down the Act as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.237" offset="684931">In regard to this claim, we first find that the appellees have standing to raise an Establishment Clause challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.421" offset="709590">As to the merits of the challenge, we conclude that the District Court did not follow the proper approach in assessing the claim that the Secretary is making grants under the act that violate the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.447" offset="753685">Although the record contains evidence of specific incidence of impermissible behavior by certain grantees, we remand the case for further consideration of the evidence insofar as it sheds light on the manner in which the statute is being administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.326" offset="809273">Justice O'Connor has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.349" offset="821394">Justice Kennedy has also filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Scalia has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.354" offset="841352">Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens have joined.</text>
