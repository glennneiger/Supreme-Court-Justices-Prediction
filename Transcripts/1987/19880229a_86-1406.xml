            <text syncTime="12.558" offset="183536">Mr. Coleman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lynn_r_coleman" startTime="61.351" stopTime="697.295">
            <label>Mr. Lynn R. Coleman</label>
            <text syncTime="61.351" offset="378723">Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.320" offset="390635">This is a preemption case, the issue being whether Puerto Rico's regulation of gasoline marketing is preempted by an alleged congressional purpose to create a completely free market for petroleum products.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.500" offset="451343">The temporary emergency Court of Appeals found that such a purpose was exhibited in Congress' termination of federal controls, and that such purpose banned state actions, and accordingly affirmed the District Court judgment which had preempted Puerto Rico's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.243" offset="522292">Now there are a few points which I do not believe are in dispute which I think should be mentioned at the outset by way of background.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.678" offset="552072">First, no commerce clause issue has been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.318" offset="566596">The regulation that we are concerned with is internal economic regulation in Puerto Rico which is at the end of the supply distribution chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.861" offset="604734">Now before passage of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act in 1973, I think that it was perfectly clear that the states could engage in regulation of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.918" offset="653009">It would be within the historic police powers reserved to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.587" offset="671712">And in fact, Puerto Rico did so for about twenty years in a form quite similar in general terms at least to that which was attempted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.819" offset="708597">Now under the EPAA, as I say was passed in 1973 in response to the Arab embargo, a temporary statute, there was preemption of conflicting state laws, and certainly Puerto Rico's own regulations were preempted at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.109" offset="781740">But I do not think that anyone contends that if that statute had expired on its planned expiration date that there would have been any carry-over preemption thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.183" offset="826044">So we are focusing here today on what happened in 1975 when Congress in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act or the EPCA, as we call it, amended the EPAA in Title IV of the EPCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.098" offset="893753">Now this question has previously been before this Court in the Tully case in 1981 and 1982, and this Court held in an order vacating a TECA opinion that there after the expiration of federal authority on September 30, 1981 that there would be no preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.071" offset="993645">TECA, however, decided that it could depart from Tully here, which it acknowledged would otherwise be controlling, because it decided that the issue had not been fully considered by this Court, and because it felt that it had received contrary instructions in the subsequent Transco opinion, which it decided was applicable here, because the EPCA revision of the EPAA involved a deregulatory statute similar to what it considered had been done in the Natural Gas Policy Act which revised the Natural Gas Act, which was considered in the Transco opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.492" offset="1159262">Our position is that the two statutes involved in Transco and this case are completely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.942" offset="1201058">As a consequence, Transco is distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.894" offset="1220911">And I will discuss the statutory point more in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.065" offset="1237629">And secondly, we think that TECA misread this Court's application of preemption concepts in Transco.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.891" offset="1268872">And principally, I think that this occurs because the Court ignored the fact that in the Northern Natural case decided some twenty years earlier, this Court had held that Congress preempted the field, occupied the field, in natural gas regulation through passage of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.116" offset="1353822">Now TECA was obviously influenced by the way that this Court asked the question as to what was before it in Transco.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.674" offset="1396036">It said in revising a comprehensive statute to give market forces a more important role, did the Congress intend to allow the states to step in and act.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.858" offset="1440757">And TECA decided that it should ask a similar question here, and look for evidence that the Congress had actually intended to allow the states to act after the federal controls expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.947" offset="1493107">But as I said, in Transco, this Court had before it a statute which had been held to occupy the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.443" offset="1535112">Now it has been made clear in a number of cases that where Congress occupies the field that within the boundaries of that occupation that it is presumed that the states will not be able to act unless Congress has told them that they can act.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.141" offset="1589864">I mean I think that is clear from a number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.156" offset="1605956">But where you do not have that kind of situation, which is what we have got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.858" offset="1624764">I mean the allegation here is that there is a conflict with a congressional purpose, not that Congress occupied the field in the EPAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.136" offset="1665828">It is far from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.792" offset="1668545">There was an express preemption clause that said you preempt in the case of conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.604" offset="1687771">So do not think that the preemption analysis that this Court utilized when it asked that question that TECA was so influenced by that that is applicable to this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.881" offset="1740852">To the contrary, I think that this Court's usual rule, which it has applied when it is making the initial determination of preemption, that applies either in an occupation case or a conflict case, that you start with the assumption that the historic police powers were not to be superceded unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.887" offset="1836878">That was a quotation from Rice v. Santa Fe in 1947, and it has been referred to any number of times subsequently, as recently as International Paper decided in the last term where it was referred to as a presumption that the state law was valid, if it was an area traditionally reserved to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.739" offset="1912320">Our position is that congressional silence of ambiguity should be resolved in favor of state law and not against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.905" offset="1948996">I think that TECA erred in doing exactly the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.904" offset="1964983">Now if you look at what Congress did in the EPCA amendment, I do not think that there is support for the conclusion that TECA reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.540" offset="2019526">And specifically, we think that TECA erred in its reading of the legislative history and certain inferences that it drew therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.395" offset="2050873">And it concluded that Congress in allowing a statute to expire or more precisely providing for its expiration after time intended to create a completely free market that would bind the states thereafter and prevent any state regulation of petroleum prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.498" offset="2127360">If you look at the context in which the EPCA amendment occurred, you find President Ford wanting the EPAA expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.791" offset="2184516">And he asked for new standby authority which he can invoke in the case of an emergency, but otherwise not.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.020" offset="2213459">I do not think that anybody would argue that if President Ford's wishes had been granted and the EPAA had been allowed to expire that there would be any preemption as a result of that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.173" offset="2254001">The House wanted long-term or permanent regulations, they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.406" offset="2275004">They would keep the EPAA with some modifications for ten years, and then convert to standby emergency authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.215" offset="2310217">The Senate pretty well agreed with the President, and wanted to remove the mandatory controls promptly followed by a short period of standby authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.086" offset="2345639">Now it is interesting to note that none of the participants in this compromise negotiation which occurred were asking for a completely free market or were asking for state preemption after the EPAA authority expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.064" offset="2409587">There is just not a word to support that, and the context is the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.984" offset="2425260">Secondly, the state preemption after EPAA expiration was never mentioned in the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.981" offset="2461205">This was a subject examined extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.778" offset="2472490">And not in the debates, and not in any of the reports of the committees of the House and the Senate, and certainly not in the conference report.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.679" offset="2504045">And if you look at the amendment, the EPCA amendment, there is certainly no statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.943" offset="2537064">They either expressly or by implication require preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.081" offset="2557649">I think that TECA focused on the structure of the EPCA amendment, and found some evidence to support its conclusion there.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.234" offset="2594220">Now what was done in the EPCA amendment was to take the mandatory controls which had been required in the EPAA and continue them for a period of 40 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.073" offset="2641659">Those would then be converted to a standby status for a period of 28 months, and that gets you to September 30, 1981 when the statute in Section 18 plainly provides that all regulatory authority expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.629" offset="2707801">Now the President had the authority under that scheme to remove on a product by product basis individual petroleum products from controls during the first 40 month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.732" offset="2768300">And during the standby period, he could remove controls or reimpose them at will; in other words, pursuant to his own discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.056" offset="2817515">Now TECA found in its work that it was inconceivable that Congress would go to the trouble of phasing out federal controls with the intention that the states could step in.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.270" offset="2862445">Now they do not cite anything to support that inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.220" offset="2878223">But it seems to us, to borrow a phrase from the Court's opinion on the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric case--</text>

            <label>Mr. Lynn R. Coleman</label>
            <text syncTime="703.231" offset="2946246">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.668" offset="2948023">This Court said in that case that it was inconceivable that Congress would intend to create a regulatory vacuum, certainly without addressing it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.727" offset="2984281">As a matter of fact, it seems to me that that raises a question whether you can really have preemptive effect from a congressional intent or a congressional purpose which is not either embodied in the statute or flows from the construction of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.624" offset="3067872">And frankly, we have neither here.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.140" offset="3073933">I am not aware of another case where that has ever been held.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.170" offset="3086054">Now the EPCA conference report was a very carefully worded compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.371" offset="3114788">I think that the Court should be cautious about reading other things into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.681" offset="3136104">And if you look at the purpose clause, it does not say a word about creating a free market and nothing about state preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.960" offset="3157211">If you look at the summary of what was to be done in Title IV, the EPCA amendment, there is nothing in there about free market or carry-over preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.690" offset="3200052">If you look at the section dealing with conversion of mandatory authority to stand-by authority, there are two isolated references to an unregulated market.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.108" offset="3249789">Now the first of these, the conferees said that we still have a problem in this country, but it is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.525" offset="3287405">It is not like it was in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.462" offset="3295138">Indeed, supplies had returned to conditions as they were in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.226" offset="3322201">There was a sufficiency of supplies, but they thought that it would be a bad idea to move to prompt decontrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.392" offset="3542883">And they said,</text>
            <text syncTime="805.816" offset="3356578">"A gradual return to an unregulated market is preferable to sudden decontrol. "</text>
            <text syncTime="811.377" offset="3378834">The context is saying that gradual is better than sudden.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.329" offset="3390641">But if you focus on the phrase EPAA was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.935" offset="3437035">The other phrase appears on the next page.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.839" offset="3452708">And the Congress said that we still have a problem, that we remain vulnerable to interruptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.991" offset="3489280">And that it is possible that if we had another embargo that we would have a serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.175" offset="3526060">And they noted that the President had asked for standby emergency authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.971" offset="3545182">"Better that we should convert the EPAA to standby authority than to write a new bill. "</text>
            <text syncTime="860.344" offset="3574752">is what they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.938" offset="3577051">So you have this second reference that TECA found significant which says that,</text>
            <text syncTime="865.750" offset="3596277">"Extension of the EPAA and its conversion to a standby authority offers in addition the potential for a smooth transition of petroleum markets from a closely regulated state to a largely unregulated status subject to standby pricing and allocation authority. "</text>
            <text syncTime="883.460" offset="3667121">Now the context is clearly talking about the situation before controls expire in 1981 rather than thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.206" offset="3718112">Because when it says 30, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.200" offset="3766178">But I would submit that the phrase "largely unregulated" is not inconsistent with there being a removal of federal controls and some state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.556" offset="3807556">It certainly does not say that there is going to be a completely free market.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.383" offset="3818841">And in the face of evidence like this, I would urge the Court to be guided by what it said in cases like Commonwealth Edison v. Montana, and Exxon v. Governor of Maryland which is cited in our brief, where it said that you cannot rely on general expressions of national policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.173" offset="3902014">That instead you must look for something specific in the statute or the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.575" offset="3927614">Now the Respondents argue, well, admittedly the EPAA has expired, that there is no authority there for preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.897" offset="3984875">But that EPCA amendment was part of a larger statute, and some of those titles are still in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.708" offset="4016117">Under Title I of EPCA, it created the strategic reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.408" offset="4034925">It is not related to general price and allocation controls under the EPAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.045" offset="4069512">In Title II, the President is given some authority to deal with international emergency through participation in the international energy plan, rationing, conservation, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.338" offset="4122697">One thing that strikes you is that these other provisions of EPCA are regulatory in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.679" offset="4144013">They do not say a word about creating a completely free market, nor in any respect do they require a free market for their operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.425" offset="4179017">And if you look at Title V of EPCA, it had a clause which dealt with the effect of state laws under Titles I and II, which clearly indicated that the Congress when it was concerned with preemption that it addressed the subject specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.290" offset="4278491">If there are no other questions, I will reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <label>Mr. John C. Harrison</label>
            <text syncTime="1045.007" offset="4313391">Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.331" offset="4358635">The temporary emergency Court of Appeals concluded that in the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 as amended that Congress exercised its power to displace the normal system of dual government, and the authorities of the states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in a field traditionally subject to their authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.355" offset="4430733">That conclusion was made despite the presumption that normally Congress does not exercise that authority that it unquestionably has, and it finds no support in the structure of history of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act or in this Court's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.818" offset="4488620">The Act, the EPAA, has a preemption clause that clearly does not apply to Puerto Rico's regulation that is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.579" offset="4523624">Moreover, there is no substantive provision of the EPAA that would said to imply preemption in the sense that this Court has used that concept whenever it has found implied preemption, that is that there is no regulatory scheme of the federal government that can be said to displace either completely or in certain circumstances regulations by the states of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.490" offset="4635324">The cases in which this Court has found such displacement have involved fairly careful inquiries into the nature and content of the federal regulation, and there is nothing like that left in the EPAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.594" offset="4683703">It now provides no substantive rule at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.735" offset="4692271">Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the final revision of the EPAA in 1975, the EPCA, negate any inference of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.042" offset="4733544">There was no mention of ongoing preemption by the EPAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.619" offset="4751830">Indeed, the context makes it quite clear that what Congress thought that it was doing with the EPAA was phasing it out, instead of just letting it expire immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.006" offset="4785371">And if it had expired immediately, there was no suggestion that there would have been preemption, and the expiration would have needed to take more time than that to run ultimately through 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.158" offset="4825913">But no one suggested that after 1981 when the statute's effects came to an end and when the President's power was no longer available under the statute that there might have been preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.233" offset="4866246">This is particularly striking given that, as Mr. Coleman noted, every other part of the EPCA, the 1975 legislation, deals with preemption explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.102" offset="4909714">In Title V of the EPCA, there is a presumption clause dealing with Titles I and II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.818" offset="4936568">Title III, both parts of that have their preemption clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.692" offset="4952137">And Title IV, which amends the EPAA, amends the statute that has its own preemption clause, and it does not preempt explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.486" offset="4983275">So it is not as if Congress had come to think of this field as naturally exclusively federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.750" offset="5004277">Congress was well aware in 1975 that the area was still subject, unless it displaced the traditional police powers of the states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.009" offset="5049417">And nevertheless, no one suggested that the extraordinary result of preemption in the absence of any substantive federal rule or any explicit discussion of preemption had been achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.879" offset="5096855">This did not occur to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.364" offset="5102811">And the only possible inference from that is that no one thought that there was going to be ongoing preemption, that they thought that the EPAA as amended meant what this Court thought that it meant in Tully after reading it, that the statute was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.576" offset="5159654">And that if Congress wanted to revisit the question, that it could do as if often does when sunsets a piece of legislation come back after the legislation has come to an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.573" offset="5195598">TECA went astray because of its misunderstanding of this Court's opinion in Transco, and in particular its misunderstanding of the context of the discussion of this Court on which it drew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.396" offset="5246903">Transco followed Northern Natural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.130" offset="5257874">Northern Natural held that Congress had occupied the field of wholesale natural gas sales and pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.843" offset="5300715">In Transco, Congress had withdrawn FERC's regulatory authority over certain categories of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.933" offset="5333107">The Court in Transco began by noting that after the Natural Gas Policy Act, the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act together, remained comprehensive federal regulation of this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.709" offset="5384202">That is to say the field was still occupied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.177" offset="5394024">And hence, unless Congress said otherwise that there would be no regulation by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.004" offset="5413355">The Court then inquired whether the withdrawal of FERC's regulatory authority indicated that Congress had ceased to occupy the field that the Court had found that it occupied in Northern Natural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.687" offset="5460062">The Court's answer in Transco was that the withdrawal of authority was not to that purpose, but it was in order to create an open space within the area that Congress continued to be occupying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.008" offset="5517322">Now when Congress occupies a field, what it does in effect is make itself into the sole legislature on that subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.475" offset="5547206">That is it displaces the normal system of dual government where both Congress and the states and Commonwealth can form their own policy and says that only Congress makes policy in this area, and only Congress makes the law in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.829" offset="5592659">Once that is done, it naturally follows that if Congress decides not to regulate something, then of course it is not going to be regulated at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.779" offset="5628395">But outside the context of occupation of the field, there is no such suggestion and there is no such suggestion of that sort in Transco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.775" offset="5660473">Transco simply found that Congress had not deoccupied those areas of the field that it had deregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.913" offset="5688999">There is also the suggestion from Respondents that the role that it has played in Transco by the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act might be filled in this case by the other titles of the general policy of the EPCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.875" offset="5756813">But as Mr. Coleman noted, this Court has made it very clear that general congressional policy at the level of abstraction that it has found in the EPCA does not overcome the presumption of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.808" offset="5808535">And indeed, Commonwealth Edison v. Montana addressed the specific policy of the EPCA, of one of the EPCA's substantive provisions, having to do with the use of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.973" offset="5861198">And what the Court found was yes, in the EPCA, Congress took certain steps in favor of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.440" offset="5887112">And yes, the Montana severance tax could raise the price of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.329" offset="5902681">But that is not the kind of clash of policies that will lead the Court to infer preemption, to infer that Congress has exercised its authority to move aside the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.465" offset="5947193">Rather the Court inferred in Commonwealth Edison and should infer here that unless it has made it clear, Congress has left in place the normal relationship between the levels of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.178" offset="5998080">Congress is still formulating national policy, and the states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are free to formulate their own policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.519" offset="6031412">There is no suggestion to the contrary anywhere in the EPAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.737" offset="6048235">And therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.345" offset="6062759">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.018" offset="6357420">Should the question be did the Congress intend to create a free market in petroleum after 1981, and then the alternative is did it intend to preempt state regulation after 1981, and what is the difference between those two questions?</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.998" offset="6413322">--Well, the difference is illustrated, Mr. Chief Justice, by the definition of intention to preempt that is given in this case, which is really central to the analysis of the Petitioners and the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.632" offset="6467866">And that definition is stated most clearly at page 9 of the reply brief, where the Petitioners say that what must be shown is an indication that Congress, and these are the words,</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.751" offset="6528365">"had in mind the preemption of state law once federal controls expired. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.235" offset="6546233">Well, even if intent to preempt is the right standard, just last month in the Thompson case, the Parental Kidnapping Act case, the Court rejected precisely that kind of an approach to a question of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.259" offset="6598374">It said in connection with the implication and the finding of an implied cause of action under that statute that while congressional intent is the right issue, we do not look to see whether Congress had consciously in mind, in fact that was the exact same phrase that it used, that the Court used, at the time that it was acting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.904" offset="8028943">It is unquestionable that there was a blend in the decision, the majority decision, of what I am referring to as conflict preemption principles, the question of whether state laws stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the federal purposes, and field preemption principles under which Congress basically must require explicitly assignment of regulatory jurisdiction exclusively to itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.847" offset="8124761">There is both of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.410" offset="8126955">And it is true that the context was Northern Natural, which was probably a field preemption case, although there was also some conflict analysis in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.782" offset="8160496">But the conflict analysis in Transco stands on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.750" offset="8176379">The only question was whether the rateable take order which was not a well head price regulation measure directly anyway was in fact a conflict with the free market objectives that Congress had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.089" offset="8233639">Now the majority of the Court felt that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.213" offset="8246178">But it obviously reinforced that judgment with the notion that even if it was not, that is even it was harmonious with the federal law, this was a kind of field preemption which excludes not only conflicting state law but also harmonious state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.379" offset="8306886">I think that there was a blend there, but I think that had the case been different, had the case been a complete deregulation case, had Congress instead of just picking out certain categories of natural gas had deregulated all natural gas, notwithstanding the background of Northern Natural, and had the case been a direct well head price regulation, the result would have been exactly the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.056" offset="8733518">And the Congress in 1975 decided that the future was going to be deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.788" offset="8756506">We are going to have unregulated markets where the price mechanism is going to send the right signals to consumers and producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.738" offset="8780330">But we cannot do it overnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.784" offset="8788480">We are too tied to the controls that we are now living with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.423" offset="8803004">We have to do it in a gradual way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.047" offset="8809482">The ultimate compromise which was a difficult and hard fought one with vetoes flying back and forth across Pennsylvania Avenue was that Congress got what it most desired which was temperance, let us do this in a calm measured way, let us deregulate gradually so that the economy can adjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.743" offset="8880326">The nation was just recovering from a deep recession, and the Congress was very concerned for obvious reasons about the impact of sudden decontrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.396" offset="8914912">What the President got though was what he most prized, which was a firm commitment by Congress to ultimate deregulation, so that the price mechanism would work, and that the economy would get back to where it ought to be, and the petroleum markets would get back to where they need to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.405" offset="8978965">Now my colleagues have said, both of them, that TECA has gone astray and misapplied Transco's analysis presuming rather than inquiring that Congress intended a free market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.633" offset="9039882">Not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.400" offset="9042912">I think that it is quite unfair to read TECA's opinion that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.788" offset="9056496">What TECA held was, and recognized correctly I think, that what this Court found in Transco was that a purpose to deregulate or a decision to remove federal regulation with an eye towards creating a free market environment will preempt state laws that interfere with market forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.544" offset="9139461">It defeats the congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.935" offset="9149074">And it then went on without the aid of any presumption and looked closely at the legislative history of the EPCA in 1975 and found, as this Court had found, in Transco that Congress in fact intended markets to operate freely, that that was the heart of the whole debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.413" offset="9210932">And it further found, as this Court found in Transco, that the Puerto Rico regulation, a direct price fixing regulation, plainly conflicts with the congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.971" offset="9257221">So although it did ask the same question in the course of its opinion that this Court suggested was appropriate, the question being did Congress intend to give the states any authority that it had withdrawn from the federal government, we think that the question properly understood was whether notwithstanding the purpose of deregulation, notwithstanding the purpose to create a free market, did Congress intend to leave the states free to interfere with the state market, and the answer to that question was plainly no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.960" offset="9373205">The burden ought to be once a free market purpose is found on those who would like state regulation to survive to show that Congress would have anticipated state regulation notwithstanding the apparent conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.813" offset="9428584">And the Court has occasionally asked that question and found that kind of an answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2487.452" offset="10083108">Whereas in our case, I think that we have a far stronger showing of what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.415" offset="10146952">And the debates which we have laid out really in summary fashion that goes on for a whole year in 1975 starting with President Ford's state of the union message, which really is a significant element of his entire presentation to the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.098" offset="10205675">He felt that it was critical to the country to move to deregulated markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.034" offset="10225423">There was a debate, and Congress resisted principally on the ground that it was not a good idea to do it rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.516" offset="10255412">But there were also some reservations about whether there really was a free market with the OPEC cartel and so forth, and it was a major dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.979" offset="10285296">Ford initially sensed some resistance, and suggested that maybe the thing to do is to phase it out, and deal with the congressional concerns about the timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.601" offset="10319778">And he offered two years as a phase-out period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.162" offset="10333988">Congress resisted and rejected that, and said that it needed to be at least five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.208" offset="10350184">But at that point, the debate shifted from the question of whether there was to be decontrol, whether markets would operate freely, to the question of when they were going to operate freely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.299" offset="10390517">It became a question of timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.596" offset="10395742">And the debate raged, and Congress passed a bill that would have extended and exacerbated in President Ford's mind the controls that were already on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.760" offset="10448405">President Ford vetoed that, and offered up a compromise of a 30 month rather than a two year deferral of decontrol or phase-out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.835" offset="10484663">That was vetoed by the House, by the Congress in a one house veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.990" offset="10501277">Ford came back with another proposal of 39 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.269" offset="10518413">That again was vetoed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.394" offset="10522906">At this point, the EPAA on its own terms having been extended a few times temporarily comes to an end on August 31, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.703" offset="10564179">And there is suddenly nothing on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.125" offset="10573792">Congress immediately puts forward a retroactive revival and extension for a short period of time of the Act, and President Ford vetoes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.590" offset="10603677">But he says, I do not want to establish policy by inaction, this is too important an area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.698" offset="10632098">I want a comprehensive national energy policy for the long term, and I want a responsible approach to the question of decontrol, and I am prepared to compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.036" offset="10673476">I will accept a 45 day extension of these controls retroactively revived on the assurance that you are all going to meet with me to compromise on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.235" offset="10706285">And that in fact is exactly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.625" offset="10719869">His veto was sustained narrowly by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.796" offset="10728542">A compromise was struck through the auspices of a conference committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.544" offset="10747454">And what emerged was a statute which has many pieces of it, and most of them are not particularly relevant to the question of decontrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.822" offset="10788623">But decontrol was the centerpiece of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.197" offset="10798132">And what Congress said was we will take, although we are going to postpone, we will take your point that there needs to be decontrols.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.319" offset="10842645">But we are going to do it in the course of three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.270" offset="10850377">And this was basically the significant section of the statute which Congress enacted with respect to the decontrol provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.922" offset="10885068">I believe that it is on page 28 of the footnote of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.609" offset="10895725">The section divides the phaseout into three pieces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.778" offset="10924460">The first piece starts right away, and it lasts about 40 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.902" offset="10944940">And during that period, Congress maintains full control over the question of petroleum regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.320" offset="10978586">It is on page 28 in footnote 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.945" offset="10989139">For the first 40 months, the President must maintain mandatory price and allocation controls on petroleum products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.534" offset="11031458">During that time, he is authorized to exempt certain products from regulation, but the Congress has a one House veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.265" offset="11058416">This is not necessarily all shown in this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.873" offset="11072836">There are other pieces of statute which add a bit to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.496" offset="11087360">At the end of the 40 month period, the President's obligation to maintain regulation evaporates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.634" offset="11119856">And the regulation becomes entirely discretionary with the President, and the Congress forsakes control with respect to the one House veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.804" offset="11148591">At the end then of another 30 months, basically after six years after enactment of the EPCA, all presidential authority expires, and presumably regulation is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.484" offset="11203239">Now one thing that I think that it is important to keep in mind is that first of all, the statute itself while it is belittled by my colleagues, the statute itself clearly had a direction in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.715" offset="11252140">The section that we are talking about moves from regulation to deregulation in a phased group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.697" offset="11276068">There is something going on there, and there is a target.</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.708" offset="11332179">But as we have discussed a few moments ago, the same argument was really made and accepted by the Mississippi Supreme Court in Transco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.794" offset="11380454">That was exactly the argument that the state made there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.310" offset="11390589">All that happened in Transco was that Congress removed federal controls over well head regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.653" offset="11411905">Now why should that prevent the state from stepping in and doing whatever it is doing, whatever it wants to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.791" offset="11432490">And the response that the Court gave in Transco is exactly the right response.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.930" offset="11448999">And it fits whether we are talking about field preemption or conflict preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.366" offset="11462792">What the Court said, and it had a conflict flavor, was that what the federal government was doing was removing the distorting effects of price controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.768" offset="11504379">The Court's words may have been artificially formalistic to assume, those were the Court's words I believe, that Congress expected that the states would then step in and start doing the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3045.159" offset="12313965">No, this is the only case in which we have complete deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.815" offset="12328594">And the question, I think, is properly framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.485" offset="12339252">Whether the standard that has been applied in connection with regulatory statutes should shift when you have a regulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.873" offset="12368823">It does not matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.498" offset="12371330">In Transco, does it matter how much regulation there was, would it have changed the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.747" offset="12392333">I do not think that it would have had there been complete deregulation of natural gas prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.089" offset="12409678">I think that the result would have been the same, because the purpose would have been the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.695" offset="12424098">And this Court's obligation under the supremacy clause is to apply the congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.912" offset="12444996">Sometimes it is clear in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.537" offset="12455445">Sometimes Congress goes out of its way to assign and to allocate responsibility under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.565" offset="12479582">It has not done it in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.939" offset="12489090">And in those cases, the Court has to carry the burden of looking to the congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.670" offset="12511974">Sometimes you have to look harder than other times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.248" offset="12522318">This is a pretty easy one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.279" offset="12526393">Now one other point that I think is important to stress is that the result of preemption here is not the blanket immunity that my colleagues suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.008" offset="12573309">It is very closely confined The only thing that the District Court preempted was price controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.350" offset="12598700">And this case would not lead to a preemption, for example, of a rateable take order in the crude oil area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.378" offset="12626808">It just would not happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.316" offset="12630570">What we have here, I think, is a crystal clear framing of the limits of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.686" offset="12664111">And it is consistent with what we think is the right principle, which is that when you are trying to find out whether a particular state regulation is or is not preempted under the Hines standard deregulation context, you look to see what was removed by Congress, what was it focusing on, what was the mechanism that it chose to get where it wanted to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.897" offset="12752927">What Congress removed here were price regulations and allocation regulations of petroleum and petroleum products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.675" offset="12779990">That is what is preempted and ought to be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.252" offset="12790334">Beyond that, we do not suggest nor do the courts below suggest that the supremacy clause goes.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lynn R. Coleman</label>
            <text syncTime="3179.698" offset="12852088">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.354" offset="12858775">Counsel for the Respondents concedes that there is no clear evidence of an attempt to preempt state regulation as such, but argues that that is really beside the point, if there is clear evidence of an intent to create a completely free market, which as a consequence would have the effect of preempting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.342" offset="12978730">Now let us focus on his contention that there is such a purpose to create a completely free market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.463" offset="13019167">I submit that he spent most of his time talking about that it could be that if Congress had such a purpose that it would follow the preemption would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.005" offset="13069322">I suggest, however, that he has given you very little evidence in briefs or in argument of anywhere in this entire debate that you can find that Congress intended to have a completely free market following the end of federal controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.495" offset="13147272">It is certainly not on the face of the statute, and it is not in the purpose clause, and I cannot see it in the structure of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.681" offset="13176006">It was never mentioned in the debates that we can find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.913" offset="13197009">And they talk about President Ford's objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.708" offset="13216130">President Ford sent to the Congress a stand-by emergency measure, Title XXII of his own bill, which would have called for stand-by authority for ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.000" offset="13261374">And it had a preemption clause in it that said in Section 1320 in essence that if we invoke that authority that we would preempt, but that we would not preempt otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.698" offset="13316127">Now if that was what the President wanted, that he wanted some stand-by authority, and he wanted merely to allow the EPAA to expire, it does not seem to me that he had in mind that in the meantime that there would be no state regulation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.864" offset="13376836">We submit that none of the participants in that debate had in mind an intent which would result in preemption here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.643" offset="13407869">An idea that you should deregulate does not necessarily mean that you want to preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.811" offset="13444545">I mean the Reagan Administration, and this is detailed in our brief, has consistently opposed federal past regulation and strongly believes in market forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.211" offset="13498148">But on every occasion when the Administration came to the Congress to discuss whether or not there ought to be preemption and in following the expiration of the EPAA, there was quite an interchange between the Congress and the Administration, they took the position one, that there was not any preemption at the present time; and two, that there should not be any preemption, even though they believed in deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.216" offset="13594174">So it does not necessarily follow that deregulation equals preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.152" offset="13613923">Now finally, in this case, they say, well, we do not have to show preemptive intent, but we merely have to show a deregulatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.447" offset="13647151">Since the entire statute was wiped out of all of its federal authority in September of 1981, the only thing that could have been left over which you need to do to create a free market would be to preempt the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.128" offset="13713815">So I suggest that the two are one and the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.111" offset="13725727">So when you look for evidence here to support preemption, it does not matter whether you call it looking for a congressional purpose to create a free market, or looking for evidence to create preemption, but it really is the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.416" offset="13782988">If I could turn for a moment to the Transco case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.305" offset="13798557">As I understand, he concedes that you have to look at the Northern Natural decision and take account of the fact that you are dealing with an occupation of the field there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.770" offset="13848398">I think that makes the case distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.207" offset="13862191">In Transco, there was clear evidence that Congress wanted the narrow category of deep cast to be deregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.906" offset="13909002">They wanted to provide an incentive for more of its development.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.918" offset="13921019">And that is distinguishable.</text>
