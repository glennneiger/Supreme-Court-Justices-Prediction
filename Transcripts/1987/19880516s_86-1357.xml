            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">In No. 86-1357, United States Department of Justice versus Julian.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.307" offset="25182">The respondents in this case are prison inmates who sued the Government under the FOIA, Freedom of Information Act for disclosure of their presentence investigation reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.799" offset="63112">These reports are prepared by a probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.463" offset="73770">They are then used by the District Court for sentencing and transmitted to the Parole Commission and the Bureau of Prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.893" offset="103549">The issue raised by this case is whether the FOIA requires that these presentence investigation reports be disclosed to the person who is the subject of the report or whether the reports instead fall under one of the Act's statutory exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.456" offset="157780">For the reason stated in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we conclude that the reports are not exempted from disclosure by either Exemption 3 or Exemption 5 of the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.807" offset="195187">And accordingly, they must be disclosed to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.382" offset="209502">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice White and Justice O'Connor have joined.</text>
