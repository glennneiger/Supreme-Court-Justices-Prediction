            <text syncTime="72.346" offset="422111">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.266" offset="449801">The convictions of Wall Street Journal reporter Foster Winans and his two co-defendants, should be reversed because what these defendants did is not securities fraud and it is not mail or wire fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.074" offset="504972">By way of overview with respect to the securities laws first, there are two principal reasons that we have as to why the securities fraud conviction should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.047" offset="552932">First, that securities fraud can only be committed on investors or persons who participate in securities transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.772" offset="595773">It is not something that can be committed upon a newspaper or upon a private employer who has not participated in the securities transaction and who has no interest in the purchase, sale, or value of the securities involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.382" offset="658258">And second, that a private company work rule, such as the Wall Street Journal's does not have the force of criminal law, particularly whereas here it is presented to employees as going beyond the requirements of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.576" offset="730983">This case involves a private wrong by Foster Wynans upon the Wall Street Journal which, if it became public, could adversely affect the newspaper's reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.920" offset="784377">This kind of wrong, we submit, however one may view it, is simply not what was intended to be covered by the securities laws, even if the wrong is cast in terms of the misappropriation of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.798" offset="851878">The securities laws were designed to protect market participants from fraud, and not employers form potential damage to their reputations.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.337" offset="898062">Just as the mail and wire fraud statutes protect persons from fraud in their capacities as property holders, the laws proscribing securities fraud protect persons from fraud in their capacity as investors or participants in market transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.430" offset="1146435">Here, Justice Stevens, what we have as Foster Winans' trading on what he perceives will likely be the market impact of the accurate articles that he is writing and that, we submit, is no different than a situation where Salomon Bros. may trade knowing that their very well-known economist partner, Murray Kaufman is going to be making a speech in the afternoon, in which he gives his opinion that interest rates are going down, and Salomon Bros., in anticipation of the market impact of that speech, buys into sensitive stocks in the morning.</text>

"</text>
            <text syncTime="955.385" offset="3954284">What you have done, essentially, is elevated every employee ethical breach into a federal crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.658" offset="3987408">You have given federal prosecutors a vehicle, even though you start with conduct that is not illegal, for establishing a process, if it is discovered... though that is not intended, if the public therefore thinks less of your employer, though there is no finding that that occurred here, and indeed, every indication is that it did not occur here... and if that reputational damage can translate somehow into economic harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.510" offset="4106735">So all ethical breaches by employees are elevated to the status of federal crimes, and we submit that quite aside from trivializing the criminal law as that would do, and quite aside from federalizing the rules pertaining to employee ethical breaches, and quite aside from the enormous discretion that this places in the hands of prosecutors, that there are three additional reasons on the facts of this case why that putative reputational damage cannot translate into the kind of economic injury which McNally requires the schemers aim for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.003" offset="4276740">Number one is, that on the facts of this case, and the testimony is undisputed, the Wall Street Journal had never made known its policy to the readers or to the public prior to the events of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.707" offset="4395545">The second reason is that the Court... this Court has held in construing the term, v. Davis, in the context of state deprivation of property without due process of law, that property does not include reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.806" offset="4487914">And with respect to interpreting the 1868 civil rights amendment, the 14th Amendment, it seems to me that the relatively contemporaneous mail and wire fraud statute, we should not assume that Congress--</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.512" offset="5138781">And we think that McNally has set forth a requirement in defining what is the "scheme" that there be an intent to deprive the victim of money or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.772" offset="5199803">Here the pre-McNally concurrent findings of fact below, were that, was that there was no intent and that, indeed, it was the aim of the... of Mr. Winans' and the co-Petitioners, to maintain the reputation and the journalistic integrity of the articles, because, in the words of the courts below,</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.720" offset="5291649">"only if that reputation were maintained. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.239" offset="5301680">could their hopes, or their perception that the articles would have impact, and therefore that their trades would be profitable, only if it were maintained, could that arrangement succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.582" offset="5359045">Turning, if I might, back to the mail and wire fraud... well, let me just address one other point with respect to the mail and wire fraud statute, and then turn to the securities law: we have also argued as a third grounds for reversal of the mail and wire fraud convictions, that the mailings and wirings here, what is alleged is that the printing of the Wall Street Journal articles, and that the mailings of the Wall Street Journal to subscribers the following day were "wires and mails" caused for the purpose for this scheme to deprive the Wall Street Journal of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.242" offset="5521736">And if one focuses on the publication schedule, or the exclusive use of the publication schedule is that which is deprived, even in this context of it not going to a competitor, of it not going to the New York Times, as the property that is deprived, on the facts here, that all occurs on the day preceding publication of the article, when there is a leak in the information, when the initial purchase of stock in anticipation of the article, occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.880" offset="5656214">So if that is a cognizable property deprivation, it is something which has fully occurred before the wires, before the mailings, of the Wall Street Journal, and in no sense can those wires or mailings be said to be caused for the purpose of executing the scheme to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.941" offset="5732492">There is no fraud alleged here nor, in fact, was there a fraud upon the readers of the Journal or on the investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.280" offset="5761853">And so even though that subsequent publication may enable, may cause to exist, that process by which Winans believes he is going to be successful in the stock market, that is not the cognizable fraud that is alleged on the Wall Street Journal in the mail and wire fraud counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.730" offset="5855685">And therefore, these mailings and wires, if that language,</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.598" offset="5871150">"cause for the purpose of executing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.634" offset="5879300">has any meaning, are not sufficient here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.501" offset="5890689">With respect, if I might return to the securities law point: we believe that the requirement of fraud that the participants in market transactions, how investors be defrauded, follows from the language of the statute, for which the misappropriation theory is not a substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.099" offset="5981073">One must, in each case where the government alleges that misappropriation has occurred, look to the particular conduct which the government asserts constitutes that misappropriation, and then determine if that conduct constitutes</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.840" offset="6536123">And with respect to the second view here, is there a securities fraud upon the entity from whom the information has been misappropriated... has the printer, Chiarella, defrauded the acquiring company in that case by virtue of the misappropriation, has Winans here committed a securities fraud upon the Wall Street Journal by virtue of misappropriation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.025" offset="6648867">If the answer to that question is "yes", in Chiarella, it is because the acquiring companies are defrauded in their capacity as investors and in their capacity as market participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.583" offset="6699022">And we submit that certainly is not the case with respect to the Wall Street Journal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.970" offset="6720652">Your Honors, the whole notion that a private employer can make a special securities law for his employees simply does not make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.944" offset="6764537">Here we had a Wall Street Journal rule presented to its employees as intended to go beyond the requirements of the law, and suddenly it has the force of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.019" offset="6816782">Let us suppose that that rule said explicitly what we believe it means implicitly, namely that, here at the Wall Street Journal, we want to follow the highest ethical requirements, while we recognize that the equal access to information rule was not accepted by the Supreme Court majority in the Chiarella decision, we nonetheless believe that it represents a higher standard of ethics, which we want Wall Street Journal employees to follow, so that we may have the highest reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.509" offset="6950738">"If you do not follow the equal access to information rule, your employment here will be terminated. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.163" offset="6977383">That, in essence, is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.531" offset="6986892">That, as a matter of internal policy, policy which the Wall Street Journal made up on pain of firing those who do not follow the policy, that by adopting that rule, the government claims that therefore the securities laws are changed with respect to the employees of the Wall Street Journal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.778" offset="7071842">Your Honors, we submit that, if Congress wants to pass a statute which says that,</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.413" offset="7090337">"utilization in the stock market of an informational advantage in violation of a private contract with anyone is a new species of crime. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.304" offset="7129938">that is fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.821" offset="7135999">Because then we will all know what the rules are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.240" offset="7145716">But to try to stuff that result, in effect, into existing securities fraud legislation, is simply to rewrite the law to give it a new ex post facto interpretation, and we submit, is contrary to the very integrity of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1919.295" offset="7809958">But nevertheless they deprived me of my property and they put it at-risk in ways which I am entitled to prevent being put at-risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.692" offset="7883519">That, I think is just what Judge Stewart meant in his findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.785" offset="7943914">For example, if someone pays me money to trick you into burning your house down, it does not seem to me I could be prosecuted for defrauding you of your house?</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.260" offset="7989785">It would be a very strange use of the word, "defraud".</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.295" offset="8001906">I somehow have to get the benefit from what you are deprived of, and that is what I do not see here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.199" offset="8025520">There may have been either an actual harm to the reputation, or a threat to the reputation, but it is not that same harm to the Wall Street Journal which constitutes the benefit to the person who allegedly did the defrauding.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="1985.339" offset="8074108">In fact, I would differ there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.541" offset="8090931">I think there is considerable symmetry between the mechanism of benefit, I would say, Justice Scalia, on one hand, and the mechanism of the potential harm on the other: the mechanism of benefit to Winans and his confederates is that people believe in this column and do not imagine that, in fact, all this stuff has been traded upon and it is just to be discounted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.048" offset="8224887">If it were not for that conviction... your questions to Mr. Buchwald earlier pointed that out... if it were not for that conviction on the part of the readers, the fraud would not have its effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.439" offset="8278490">So the reputation is there on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.224" offset="8289670">It is the very thing that the Wall Street Journal is selling its newspapers on, on one hand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2958.857" offset="11968129">The heart of the fraud here is that there is a relationship of trust and that somebody who is in that relationship of trust misappropriates what has been entrusted to him to the detriment of the one who trusts him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.652" offset="12043362">Now, the work rule may simply set the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.656" offset="12063319">The contours, if you like, of what relationship of trust is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.376" offset="12086203">So, for instance, if I may use a humble example, but one which I suppose happens every day: one employer may say to his employees,</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.024" offset="14436805">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.274" offset="14445791">Very briefly, on the mail and wire fraud analysis in the deprivation of information point: We believe that all roads lead to a putative reputational damage, is what the government is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.069" offset="14512978">Here you have lawfully acquired information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.603" offset="14527189">When you use information, unlike a car, you are not depriving the other person of that information either permanently, temporarily, or partially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.828" offset="14572015">And the cutoff point, it seems to us, as to where information takes on some kind of property value in anything even remotely resembling a McNally sense, is either when you use the information in competition with your employer, or where you are giving the information to a competitor to use in competition; in essence in a trade secret sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.861" offset="14664175">With respect to General Fried's suggestion that, the in connection with requirement is satisfied if the scheme is for the purpose of buying or selling stocks, in addition to the example which Justice White gave, the example of obtaining information from a prominent investment advisor, if I join the Joe Granville hotline with a bounced check and no intention actually of paying Mister Granville for his advice and I then get a telegram in return for my one thousand dollar bounced check, saying that he recommends XYZ company and then I now go out and buy the stock in XYZ, under the government's theory, that would be a securities fraud, because it is for the purpose of trading in securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.578" offset="14875035">And essentially, because the government wishes to move away from these examples of the embezzlement, and the use of information fraudulently obtained from an investment advisor, they place a limiting principle of fairness on the market, which we believe cannot be found on the market, which we believe is not and cannot be found, in the language of xx.</text>
