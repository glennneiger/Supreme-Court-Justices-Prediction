            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">In No. 87-267, D. H. Holmes Company, Limited versus McNamara, involves a state tax on commercial activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.457" offset="41796">D. H. Holmes is a department store based in New Orleans and it had its merchandize catalogs printed out of state and shipped to its customers in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.625" offset="86413">Louisiana levied a used tax on the value of these merchandize catalogs.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.242" offset="112953">D. H. Holmes who was required to pay the tax argued that the imposition of this tax on its catalogs violated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.324" offset="149211">We disagree and find instead that the tax was fully consistent with the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.451" offset="169796">We therefore affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Louisiana Court of Appeals and that opinion is unanimous.</text>
