            <text syncTime="11.810" offset="183910">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.232" offset="209510">The question that this case presents is whether or not Clara Watson can test her employer's subjective employment practices by disparate impact theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.420" offset="250261">We ask the Court to reverse the decision of the 5th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.582" offset="263009">I'd like to discuss some of the pertinent facts and then discuss the five main points or our reasons for asking the Court to reverse this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.958" offset="296446">Those reasons in summary are that the Griggs v. Duke Power that announced the doctrine of disparate impact did not carve out an exception for subjective practices, that the legislative history of the 1972 amendments to Title VII also endorsed both disparate impact and the prior case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.301" offset="369798">Furthermore, that the EEOC guidelines have applied disparate impact to subjective practices since at least 1970, that there is no bright line between objective and subjective practices that the Respondent would have this Court adopt, and, lastly, that the adoption of this exception would urge employers or at least foster employers more use of subjective practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.098" offset="469063">Clara Watson, after having nine years experience as a cashier at a Montgomery Wards, applied in 1973 to Fort Worth National Bank as a teller.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.696" offset="511381">She applied actually several times before she was hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.897" offset="520263">When she was hired, she was hired not as a teller but as a proof operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.899" offset="532175">The bank had at that time four black employees, none of them in positions that were visible to the public, and the proof operators and the two proof... I mean printing employees were in the basement and there was a cafeteria employee and a porter.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.628" offset="595182">After three years on the job, she was made a teller at the bank and then, after seven years on the job, in 1980, she first applied for a position, for a supervisory position and actually, in February of '80, there were two supervisory positions that were available; one as the supervisor of the lobby tellers and the other as supervisory of the motor bank tellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.103" offset="676998">She applied for each and in each case, she was refused the job and a white male in one instance, white female in another instance, was selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.548" offset="714823">One year later, the same two positions became available and she sought both of those positions again with the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.283" offset="741781">A white female was selected for the lobby supervisor and a white male for the motor bank supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.079" offset="768949">In 1984, even long after the 1981 refusal, she... there were still no black directors, officers or supervisors at the Fort Worth Bank and Trust, despite the fact that the bank is within a few miles of the two main areas of concentration of the black population in Fort Worth, a city that has about a twenty-two percent black population.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.742" offset="859646">The bank system of both hiring and assigning persons to jobs within the bank was one that relied on the decisions of the supervisors, department supervisors, with very little interference from the upper management.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.806" offset="927878">Those supervisors were, of course, all white.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.856" offset="936028">The compensation system that the bank used was a series of... they used evaluations for both supervisory personnel and for line personnel, but those evaluations were filled out by the same supervisors and, once again, all were reviewed by a salary review committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.627" offset="1007185">The salary review committee rarely changed or affected the decision of those supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.871" offset="1028083">The... both the District Court and the Court of Appeals found that this limited group of white department heads made virtually all the hiring and promotion decisions as well as evaluations used to compute compensation and that the upper management routinely approved those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.684" offset="1099345">Clara Watson, at trial, based on a stipulated data base, presented a very comprehensive statistical study which showed that in the area of hiring, blacks were hired at a rate of 3.5 percent while whites were hired at a rate of 14.8 percent, almost four times greater, and that figure was disputed somewhat by the bank, who claimed that they only hired people... we used all the applications and all the persons who were hired, they disputed that and said we only hire people whose applications were on file for two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.557" offset="1234869">So, during trial, that was also analyzed, although we were able to show that that really wasn't true because--</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.558" offset="10218901">My problem with that, Justice Scalia, is that that is not the intention of Congress, at least not the way I read Title VII and the history of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.652" offset="10255264">It's just the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.872" offset="10260070">It places the decision of who is promoted, instead of being free of racial consideration, race becomes the paramount consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.239" offset="10297582">To me, that's just an absolute abomination of the purpose of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.132" offset="10321197">The cases of this Court have uniformly, I believe, recognized a distinction between the objective types of criteria as opposed to the subjective criteria that we're considering here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.574" offset="10394967">The Griggs case, of course, dealt with the objective test of the high school education requirement, and also the standardized testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.591" offset="10438957">That type of objective standard was easily identifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.305" offset="10453899">The causation could be pointed to and the impact shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.608" offset="10475110">Those type of objective standards have been found in other cases, such as Dothard, involving the minimum height and weight requirement, the New York Transit Authority case, which dealt with the exclusionary rule that disqualified persons who had a history of drug use, Teale that dealt with a written test, and Albemarle that dealt with written tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.963" offset="10568524">But opposed to those type of cases are the McDonnell Douglas, the Furnco, the Aikens and the Burdine cases, which recognize a different set of proof and a different set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.332" offset="10621919">The situation in McDonnell Douglas was an individual who complained that he was not hired because of his participation... was not hired because of his race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.061" offset="10668834">The reason articulated by the employer was that he was not hired or not rehired because of his participation in illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.536" offset="10702794">The Court held and pointed out the distinction between that type of an articulated reason that is subjective and inherently unique to the employer as opposed to those which were present in Griggs which had the effect of disqualifying large groups of people automatically, and I think that's the key to the distinction between McDonnell Douglas and Griggs, is that, on the one hand, you have these objective artificial rules which disqualify large groups of people, regardless of consideration of their individual qualifications, where, with McDonnell Douglas, you have a consideration of qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.573" offset="10866947">Here, in my case, the bank recognized that Clara Watson was fully qualified for the job she sought or at least possessed the minimum qualifications as well as did others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.271" offset="10909683">Some of the selections that were involved here today, there were four or five other people considered, including in that group was at least one other black person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.157" offset="10953256">The bank considered the qualifications of each of those people on an individual basis and reached the conclusion that the person selected was the best qualified and, therefore, the others were less qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.497" offset="11010621">But that's the type of selection process that was referred to in the Johnson v. Transportation Authority opinion from last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.691" offset="11051372">The purpose of Title VII impact cases is to remove these arbitrary barriers which prevent large groups of minorities and women from being qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.702" offset="11107483">But once they've been qualified, then the decisions as to whether they were chosen or not chosen should be considered under disparate treatment theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.346" offset="11137994">If there is a pattern and practice of racial discrimination or discrimination on other prohibited bases, then that will come out as a part of the disparate treatment proof, and if it is proved by the statistical evidence, it can be dealt with and can be the basis for finding that the defendant is guilty of discriminatory intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3052.964" offset="12348508">They are no different than the type of selection process that Justice Stevens referred to with his law clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.901" offset="12384243">If, for instance, Justice Stevens determined that he chose to retain one of his law clerks for a second term, and he wanted to choose among the law clerks he had which one that he would retain for that second term, he's going to necessarily rely upon his intuitive subjective judgment as to which one is the best qualified, will most fulfill his needs as a law clerk, and I think it's just ludicrous to suggest that Justice Stevens should have to hire an industrial psychologist to devise some form of test so that his decisions can be validated so as he can avoid a claim of discriminatory impact.</text>

Rath Packing Company, the EEOC prosecuted the Rath Packing Company for subjective hiring and promotion practices under the disparate impact theory and prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.698" offset="13039394">The court so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.880" offset="13044201">Their guidelines for eighteen years have required that subjective practices be treated under the disparate impact theory and the questions and answers that are supposed to guide employers in applying the guidelines state that, too, and we have that in our reply brief.</text>
