            <text syncTime="6.479" offset="25913">And in Meyer against Grant we also have unanimous opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.963" offset="43781">The case involves a Colorado statute which provides that a proposed constitutional amendment can be placed on the general election ballot if enough signatures -- as -- are obtained supporting the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.502" offset="105953">The statute however provides that it's a felony to pay people to help circulate petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.985" offset="131866">And the Court of Appeals with the Tenth Circuit held that this provision violated the First Amendment and we agree unanimously and affirm its judgment holding that this statute violates the First Amendment.</text>
