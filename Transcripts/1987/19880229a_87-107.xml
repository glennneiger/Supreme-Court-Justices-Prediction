            <text syncTime="57.603" offset="361051">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.023" offset="374739">We seek reversal of two rulings concerning the scope and application of Title 42 United States Code Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.206" offset="415386">Section 1981 guarantees to all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States the same right to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.983" offset="470556">The first issue presented is whether an employer that intentionally subjects a black worker on account of her race to onerous and discriminatory terms and conditions of employment violates Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.132" offset="539102">The second issue is whether a black employee who establishes that she was denied a promotion because of her race must additionally affirmatively prove that she was more qualified than the white worker who received the promotion in order to hold her employer liable for promotion discrimination under Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.778" offset="633665">In this case, unlike many cases of employment discrimination, the plaintiff presented extensive direct evidence that her employer engaged in blatant intentional discrimination on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.645" offset="701165">According to the evidence, the President and General Manager of McLean Credit Union stated that black workers are slower by nature than white workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.580" offset="744947">And he stated that he did not want to hire a black worker because they cause problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.919" offset="770233">And there were numerous instances of racial remarks and race-based conduct that were introduced into the record including an admission by one of the Company witnesses that policy of the President was not to hire black workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.851" offset="838047">Brenda Patterson was at first the only black worker at McLean Credit Union and later one of only two black workers and she was the victim of racial discrimination during her ten years of employment under the management of the president and general manager, Robert Stevenson.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.451" offset="928431">Patterson filed suit charging the credit union with intentional discrimination in the terms and conditions of her employment and with promotion discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.118" offset="975033">The District Court dismissed the claim of discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.475" offset="1012545">The Fourth Circuit concluded that Section 1981 prohibits discrimination only with respect to hiring, firing and promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.687" offset="1053296">On the promotion claim, the District Court instructed the jury that the plaintiff had the burden of proving both that she was denied the promotion because of her race, and that she was more qualified than the white employee who received the promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.120" offset="1119124">And the Court of Appeals affirmed this jury instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.149" offset="1135216">With regard to the scope of Section 1981, under the rule of law adopted by the Fourth Circuit, protection under Section 1981 is afforded only against refusals to enter into a contract or continue in a contractual relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.390" offset="1224137">Under that rule of law, a black worker can get a job but the black worker can be forced to pay a very high price for that job in loss of dignity.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.247" offset="1263634">The employer can say to that worker, we'll hire you but only if you submit to conditions of employment in which you are humiliated and demeaned because of your race.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.742" offset="1305534">It is our position that that type of condition of employment is exactly the badge of inferiority that the Thirteenth Amendment and Section 1981 were designed to prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.048" offset="1374811">It seems obvious that a black worker who is forced to pay the price of stigma and humiliation in order to be able to perform the contract that she has a right to enter into has not been afforded the same right to make and enforce a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.790" offset="1449730">The black worker's exercise of her right to make and enforce a contract has been burdened because of her race.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.343" offset="5595990">And I think the Court's cases make clear that Section 1981 and the parallel provision, Section 1982, go beyond merely guaranteeing an absolute right to enter into a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.296" offset="5751784">In fact, under State law it was clear that the swimming pool association had the right to exclude blacks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.002" offset="5870589">And nonetheless, the Court held that the membership in the swimming pool association was a benefit that became associated with home ownership because a third party voluntarily made it available to persons in the area, and that the persons who were making it available could not make it available on a racial basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.355" offset="6868049">And even if this employer had promoted fifty whites who were equally qualified with the fifty blacks that it rejected, none of those fifty blacks would be able to bring a case under Section 1981 for promotion discrimination because none of them could prove that they were more qualified.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.677" offset="6941296">But an employer is not allowed to choose among equally qualified candidates on the basis of race, and in this case there was more than sufficient evidence to lead to the conclusion that the promotion decision was being made on the basis of race.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.758" offset="7213596">The petitioner's case in the first instance is a case of adverse working conditions and she bases that case of adverse working conditions on several pieces of evidence of discrete acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.205" offset="7271379">That is that the President of the credit union stared at her, that he criticized her work, that he made two discrete racial remarks, one in 1972 and one in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.371" offset="7324042">Her allegations of excessive work load.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.760" offset="7345671">The question presented to this Court is whether these acts of alleged racial harassment standing alone present a cognizable claim under Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.816" offset="7409828">I believe that it's obvious that the terms conditions and privileges of employment language which is in Title VII would cover alleged racial harassment, adverse working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.889" offset="7462178">The language in Section 1981, however, is a different kind of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.854" offset="7489972">The language there is to make and enforce contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.634" offset="7509093">And I believe that they're two different things, so I hope that this Court will take the opportunity to define and differentiate the various rights available under each of the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.224" offset="7555487">Part of the problem in understanding what rights are available in the statutes is the fact that many of the lower courts have used the term, discrimination, synonymous with various things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.016" offset="7606687">As you read the cases, you'll find that discrimination sometimes means racial harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.358" offset="7628003">Sometimes discrimination means adverse working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.262" offset="7643676">Sometimes discrimination means disparate treatment in hiring, firing, promotion, wage discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.946" offset="7674396">In this case, we're dealing with discrimination as it means abusive working environment, hostile working environment--</text>

          <turn speaker="penda_d_hair" startTime="3228.018" stopTime="3400.277">
            <label>Ms. Penda D. Hair</label>
            <text syncTime="3228.018" offset="13042664">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.423" offset="13052277">In my initial argument, I did not reach the legislative history of Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.577" offset="13076937">If there's any doubt about the language of the Statute, the legislative history makes it overwhelmingly clear that what Congress was concerned about was onerous treatment, onerous conditions of employment that former slave owners were putting on former slaves and other black workers including whipping them, stopping talking on the job, all the way from things that might be considered miner such as talking on the job to whipping, were the types of treatment that Congress was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.346" offset="13195951">With regard to your question, Justice Scalia, about whether Section 1981 guarantees an equal right to perform a contract, I believed that the Court reached that conclusion in footnote 78 of the Jones v. Mayer, although Jones was a Section 1982 case; footnote 78 discussed Section 1981, and it held where a group of whites terrorized blacks in order to stop them from performing their contract, that those whites had violated the rights of blacks under Section 1981 to dispose of their labor by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.503" offset="13344640">With regard to the jury instruction, this is not a case where there were no facts to support the conclusion that the reason given was a sham and that the real reason was racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.795" offset="13393750">Justice Marshall referred to two racial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.356" offset="13408065">I counted nine different racial statements made by the President of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.057" offset="13434814">And Justice Scalia, you asked whether Mrs. Patterson complained about those statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.321" offset="13455921">The record shows that another employee did complain about the statements and not only statements, he complained about discrimination and refusal to hire a black computer operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.190" offset="13495314">And that employee was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.751" offset="13505554">The District Court found that there was sufficient evidence to submit the promotion claim to the jury and particularly the District Court relied on the fact that Mrs. Patterson introduced evidence to suggest that Susan Williamson was trained for the job for a period of time before she was actually promoted, and she was put into training for that job at a time when she had failed in her training for a computer operator job, and was brought back over, put into a new job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.865" offset="13626031">There was a vacancy that somebody else was filling, and then after she received the training, she was actually promoted into that job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.377" offset="13660094">And given the direct evidence in this case, given the evidence of training, it's simply not true that the jury instruction was harmless, which is essentially what Mr. Davis' argument boils down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.340" offset="13715996">If there are no further questions, I have nothing further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.433" offset="13728326">Thank you very much.</text>
