            <text syncTime="13.245" offset="182179">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this case presents the question of the meaning of the term 29 USC Section 255(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="27.302" offset="238395">That section provides that an action may be brought</text>
            <text syncTime="31.081" offset="253441">"within two years after the cause of action has accrued except that a cause of action arising out of a wilfull violation may be commenced within three years. "</text>
            <text syncTime="39.657" offset="287819">This action was brought in 1984 by the Secretary of Labor to enjoin further overtime pay violations and to compel payment of overtime accrued during the prior two and a half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.276" offset="338287">It was brought under Section 217 of the Act authorizing equitable relief, so there is in this case no question of the availability of liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.226" offset="374023">We are simply talking here about compensatory relief and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.147" offset="389696">In that action the Secretary moved for summary judgment based primarily on the records of the employer, and that motion was granted by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.565" offset="423446">The court first rejected the defense of the employer that his behavior his conduct was justified under the so-called Belo plan exception of the Fair Labor Standards Act, Section 207(f), and went on to address the question of the statute of limitations provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.887" offset="488648">The court rejected the contention that the three-year statute of limitations was inapplicable here on the ground that the conduct was not wilfull, and in doing so it applied what was at that time the uniform view of the Courts of Appeals, the so-called appreciable possibility test first adopted by the Fifth Circuit in the Jiffy June Farms case.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.924" offset="588854">The court said that that test requires only an awareness of the possible application of the Fair Labor Standards Act and found on those facts that the vice president and general manager had made clear that he was indeed aware of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and that that Act does govern over time systems of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.009" offset="661161">The Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed with regard to the issue of a violation and, however, reversed with regard to the statute of limitations question.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.991" offset="705151">It found that the appreciable possibility test was inappropriate, stating primarily the reason that it has the tendency to collapse the two tiers that are plainly contemplated on the face of the statutory provision, the two tiers of liability, two years versus three years, because in virtually every case, although I think not in every case, an employer is going to be found to be aware of an appreciable possibility that the Fair Labor Standards Act will cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.712" offset="812044">Instead of the at that point established appreciable possibility test, the court applied the test enunciated by this Court in the Thurston case, where it dealt not with this statute, but rather dealt in the context of the Age Discrimination Employment Act's section dealing with liquidated damages, and that test is generally articulated as requiring a knowledge of the violation or reckless disregard for the matter of whether or not the conduct is in fact in violation of the law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="211.947" offset="976929">I think that there... the answer to that question turns upon the precise application given, the precise interpretation given to the reckless disregard test, and our concern with the reckless disregard test is essentially... it is not with the part that talks about disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.564" offset="1055401">It's the part that talks about reckless.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.751" offset="1060207">And we feel that the term "reckless disregard" as it is used generally throughout the law carries with it a connotation of outrageous conduct, a connotation of highly unreasonable conduct, and that if you read that connotation into the Thurston test, I think it is arguable at least... I think it is unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.101" offset="1145575">I think you would have to remand to get the determination whether we meet that test or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.314" offset="1206388">Number One, with regard to overtime that everyone agreed had to be paid quite apart from the Belo plan issue, payments were not made anywhere close to the statutory one and a half times rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.778" offset="1256230">And secondly, there are four requirements for this Belo plan requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.434" offset="1274934">It was our position below and it continues to be that none of the four were met, and we believe that in those two respects the plan is indeed outrageous and is indeed--</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="318.859" offset="1404605">Well, we think that in the context of the Fair Labor Standards Act, there is strong authority that liquidated damages are themselves not punitive, as this Court found in Thurston in the Age Discrimination Act, but rather are compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.104" offset="1457582">The Court's reasoning in the Thurston case finding that the liquidated damages were punitive looked to the legislative history, where Congress had substituted in essence for the criminal provision, criminal enforcement provision of the FLSA a liquidated damages penalty and had specifically not applied the liquidated damages provisions of the FLSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.564" offset="1547443">In the FLSA, the authority of this Court, the Overnight Transport case and other cases have explicitly said that liquidated damages are compensatory, and I think that is not an implausible conclusion when you consider the various things they can be compensating for: number one, delay, interest that accrues on something that is unpaid for a period of years; number two, the emotional strain, the humiliation, as has been said by some courts that results in the context of a denial of pay to which you are legally entitled; and number three, consequential damages of whatever sort that may result when you are paid as your salary less than you are entitled to and perhaps at a rate that makes it difficult to live in the way that you are accustomed to or would like to.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="399.702" offset="1728001">Well, I wonder if there aren't some advantages to having a more uniform test of what is meant by wilfull, whether it appears in this statute or another one.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="411.823" stopTime="519.749">
            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="411.823" offset="1776485">Well, I think there are indeed some advantages, but I think the approach that needs to be taken is not one that simply says there are some advantages, therefore the language must mean the same thing, but is rather an approach much like the one this Court took in Thurston of looking at the particular statute, looking at the particular context in which the words appear, and deciding whether or not... what the precise meaning should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.108" offset="1889543">In this situation we think that the proper standard is one that is really a refinement of what the Court said in Thurston, a refinement in the sense that it indeed does pay attention and adopt the notion of disregard, but the question is, disregard of what?</text>
            <text syncTime="458.929" offset="1964880">We think really what the Court ought to do in the context of the statute of limitations provision is start with the question of whether the employer was aware of an appreciable possibility that his conduct might not... might be governed by the statute, that is, start with the old Jiffy June appreciable possibility test, but go on beyond that test and ask the question, what does the employer do in light of that knowledge, in light of that uncertainty, and does he act in a way that is reasonable in light of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.354" offset="2094552">We think what the employer should be required to do is, when he has that uncertainty, seek and get reliable assurances that his conduct is in fact in compliance with the law, and if he doesn't do that and he rather proceeds to act aware that he may be violating someone's rights to minimum wage or to overtime compensation, then he should be made to bear the risk of that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.338" offset="9502460">With some variations, the petitioner has advanced a test for determining wilfullness set out in its brief at Page 13 as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.473" offset="9559094">"We think an employer's unlawful pay practices should be found wilfull for purposes of the FLSA's limitation provision when the employer is aware of the potential application of the FLSA but pursued the pay practices without reliable assurances of their legality, and then in the same vein in the reply brief that a wilfull violation would exist where an employer is aware of the FLSA applicability and fails to take steps to determine the statute's demands, or having taken such steps do not secure a reasonable basis for eliminating uncertainties about their compliance. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.578" offset="9747489">As I believe was evident from some of the questions the petitioner offers amnesty only to those who sought reliable or reasonable advice on their legal obligation, and there is no definition of what the petitioner conceives to be reliable or reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.991" offset="9841112">It could very likely be only that which or who agree with petitioner's views.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.223" offset="9874026">Would the petitioner, for example, find that this respondent, relying on my advice, would not have acted properly because my advice might not have been considered reliable since I had disagreed with the Jiffy June decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.730" offset="9956050">Isn't that what an employee would be faced with?</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.227" offset="9978098">Or, is the reliability of advice to be determined by a Martindale Hubbell listing?</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.302" offset="10010385">It just boggles the mind that this is what the government conceives to be an appropriate substitute for the Jiffy June standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.671" offset="10063884">And what comfort or security can the respondent and others derive as to what would be the definition considering again that the Jiffy June argument was espoused in both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals?</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.883" offset="10144654">Meeting those tests, the three criteria, we admit the respondent knew that the Act applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.003" offset="10193138">As to the second, we submit, as I stated before, that they used the coefficient table, albeit improperly, and we further say that the final criteria called for by petitioner of reliability and reasonableness is unrealistic and onerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.524" offset="10295224">It would mean that every employer before doing anything would have to seek a legal opinion on any action he took.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.629" offset="10331691">We have got to remember that my client is a small business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.643" offset="10347678">They don't have house counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.329" offset="10358441">They can't afford to have everything run through attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.060" offset="10385399">But more unsettling is the fact that after that legal opinion would have been secured there is no assurance that the government would still say, you done a reasonable thing, what you are doing is not wilfull.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.475" offset="10459064">They would sit in judgment on the advice given the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.723" offset="10480067">That is an horrendous suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.519" offset="10495218">If we are talking about reasonableness and since the petitioner now espouses that theory, let us look at what the conduct of the petitioner has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.965" offset="10568987">How reasonable has its conduct been?</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.948" offset="10580899">First, and it was mentioned in the argument, wilfullness requirement of the FLSA statute of limitations provision the petitioner states is designed to protect certain employers from unanticipated liability rather than to punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.158" offset="10665745">Nothing in the record indicates that my client anticipated this liability, and nothing in the record shows any recklessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.919" offset="10716841">So if we use that test, my client is home free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.197" offset="10749964">They never anticipated this liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.758" offset="10764174">Is it reasonable to believe that my client established some contingent fund to take care of this?</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.551" offset="10803358">If they did that would be an act evidencing wilfullness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.160" offset="10817778">I believe mention was made of uniformity of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.001" offset="10845154">And the Second Circuit Court in the case of Rousseau versus Trafari pointed out,</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.248" offset="10870127">"We believe that wilfull should have but a single meaning within the ADA, and that therefore the Thurston definition applies. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.634" offset="10907639">"Construing identical language in a single statute in pari materia is both traditional and logical. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.147" offset="10941703">"Moreover, a single meaning avoids potential jury confusion resulting from different instructions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.457" offset="10970960">And concerning the same word, the petitioner argued in support of that theory in the Thurston case, and yet in the brief here it would appear that the petitioner denies any need for uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.667" offset="11051835">I on that subject point out to one other fact, that in its petition for certiorari there was an admission that the federal government itself has taken different positions on the proper interpretation of wilfull violation as used in the FLSA statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.956" offset="11140965">That certainly doesn't give anyone assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.172" offset="11153817">The reference to that is in its petition at Page 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.124" offset="11165624">The allegation then is made that the history of the Act suggests that the standard of wilfullness was to allow employees and the Department of Labor needed additional time to challenge unlawful pay practices, and the Circuit Court discussing the issue of punitiveness rejects the petitioner's position and states that more time is needed, that more time is needed by saying it is neither more difficult to detect nor more severe than it would be were the violations not wilfull.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.058" offset="11345347">And today again the petitioner acknowledges, as it did in its brief, that the In re Picture standard threatens to collapse the two-tiered scheme envisaged by Congress into a one-tiered scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.036" offset="11417340">When did they first became aware of that obvious fact, and why did they subject us to this litigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.173" offset="11449836">I think the most bizarre of the petitioner's case rests in its proposal in its brief at Page 45, when the petitioner states,</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.337" offset="11522457">"Respondent should be afforded an opportunity to present new evidence, including evidence of any efforts it undertook to secure reliable assurances that its pay practices complied with the FLSA. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.223" offset="11582016">"If respondent acknowledges in this Court that there is no such evidence, this Court should order affirmance of the District Court judgment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.937" offset="11624857">"Otherwise, the case should be returned to the District Court for further proceedings on the third year of back pay liability. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.339" offset="11654532">Is that considered a reasonable approach?</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.635" offset="11667698">If this were an appropriate choice, and we dispute it, why wasn't it advanced previously?</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.772" offset="11700194">Why wasn't that alternative given to the respondent?</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.692" offset="11723913">We submit that the alternatives offered the respondent are not properly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.643" offset="11747737">If I may paraphrase, I would say it would be more reasonable for me since the petitioner does have the burden of proving wilfullness to state to the petitioner, if petitioner acknowledges in this Court that it has no further evidence of wilfullness than it has to date, despite what was said in answer to a question, this Court should order affirmance of the Circuit Court judgment and further hold that as a matter of law based on the evidence already in the picture respondent has no liability for the third year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.488" offset="11899143">And then what was said here, the observation that the petitioner's standard be viewed at most as a variation on Thurston's standard, and that Thurston need not be read as substantially different from the petitioner's prose standard, I would suggest smacks more of salesmanship than accurate observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.696" offset="11987959">The standard now proposed, asserts the petitioner, was always a possible resolution as this case progressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.801" offset="12036338">If that were really the case, I would submit respectfully that it was the most carefully hidden secret in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.376" offset="12074685">And then, in the reply brief, the petitioner attempts to allay the fear of the respondent that there is no significant danger that wilfullness disputes will center on whether an attorney's advice if relied upon is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.804" offset="12168413">The requirement, continues the petitioner, means only that a court must examine the advice as one factor in determining the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.642" offset="12211672">Won't the petitioner examine that advice initially, at the outset, before it becomes a court case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.029" offset="12249288">And what does one factor mean, 25 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.105" offset="12277605">We have no assurance on what a person in the position of the respondent can expect?</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.554" offset="12319401">We submit that this Court in Thurston has already determined the meaning of wilfull, that it is a knowing or a reckless disregard, and contrariwise the petitioner can point to no decision of this Court to support the definition now urged, nor can it point to any evidence in the record that would show a reckless disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.055" offset="12465373">The petitioner seeks to distinguish the standard in this case and Thurston on the ground that Thurston dealt with liquidated damages rather than the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.096" offset="12521484">We submit that the reasoning in Thurston is equally applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.937" offset="12544890">The end result of what is urged if a third year of liability is found to exist is added money paid out for a violation of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.145" offset="12649693">That is punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.050" offset="12665366">The fact that it is called something else doesn't mean any less as far as the employer, the respondent is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.280" offset="12710297">It means paying out money for having done something conceived subsequently to be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.965" offset="12737046">We submit that on the record as it stands now, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that the respondent did anything improper, anything wilfull, anything other than a reasonable and responsible business would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.595" offset="12847492">We ask that this Court reject the contention of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.983" offset="12873092">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="3191.090" offset="12893467">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.480" offset="12899110">I would just like to make one point about the extent to which the statute of limitations provision in fact governs the recoverability of liquidated damages in answer to Justice O'Connor's earlier question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.304" offset="12950414">I have already said that it is our view and I think it is the Court's historical view that liquidated damages under the FLSA are compensatory, not punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.861" offset="12984583">The other point I want to make is that only in a very partial and somewhat peculiar sense does the statute of limitations control the recoverability of liquidated damages, and I say that because of the Section 260 provision that essentially governs whether or not an employer is going to be able to avoid the payment of liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.368" offset="13078623">That provision says that the employer can come in and show a reasonable basis for... a good faith reasonable basis for believing his action was legal, and then within the Court's discretion the court may decide to award no liquidated damages if it doesn't want to, so that it is only in the sense of avoiding considering that Section 260 that the statute of limitations controls the availability of liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.296" offset="13178307">If there are no further questions, I have nothing further.</text>
