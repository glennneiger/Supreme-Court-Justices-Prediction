            <text syncTime="11.340" offset="171214">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this case looks to the Thirteenth Amendment and its implementing legislation, principally Section 1584, Title XVIII of the U.S. Code, which makes it a crime for any person to knowingly and wilfully hold another to involuntary servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.255" offset="258881">At issue are the sorts of conduct the term "involuntary servitude" can properly reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.020" offset="285943">Is it limited solely to the use of physical or legal force or the threat thereof, as the Second Circuit has held, or, as the court below concluded, may a defendant also be criminally liable if he uses fraud and deceipt to hold another against his or her will, at least as to certain classes of individuals, minors, immigrants, or mentally incompetent, or as we maintain and as the Ninth Circuit has held, may other forms of coercion also lead to criminal culpability if such behavior was intended to compel another to work against his or her will and did in fact have that result?</text>
            <text syncTime="83.738" offset="460755">The actual backdrop in this case for deciding the issue is briefly the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.402" offset="491370">Mr. and Mrs. Kozminski, with the help of their son, John, ran a family dairy farm outside Ann Arbor, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.349" offset="527210">In about 1967, a farmhand named Bob Fulner was brought to work on the farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.003" offset="553855">Several years later, in the early 1970s, a second man, Lewis Molitoris, was brought to the farm to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.041" offset="585934">Both men were moderately retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.503" offset="599831">They viewed the world in much the same way as children between the ages of seven and ten years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.948" offset="625640">The men generally worked from 3:00 o'clock in the morning until 8:30 or 9:00 o'clock at night, seven days a week, no holidays, performing heavy farm labor, including the cleaning of cow manure out of the barn by hand twice a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.001" offset="693767">They were initially paid $15 a week plus room and board, but that pay was reduced to $1 a week and then was stopped altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.086" offset="734205">From about 1980 on, the two men were housed in an insect-infested trailer that had broken windows, no running water, no lights, and no heat.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.505" offset="783837">They were dressed in torn clothes that did not provide protection against the cold and that remained filthy because the only washing machine that was available to them was broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.312" offset="831067">They were denied medical assistance even when they suffered serious injuries, and were given food consisting largely of mouldy bread and cold cuts that left them serious nutritional deficiencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.212" offset="898672">They were regularly subjected to physical and verbal abuse for not working as directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.608" offset="924272">They were told not to leave the farm, and they were threatened that they would be sent to institutions if they did so.</text>
