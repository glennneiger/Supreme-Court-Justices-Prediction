            <text syncTime="95.774" offset="514322">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case arises under Title 7 of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the statutory scheme for labor-management relations in the federal sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.702" offset="570015">The case involves a principle that is as basic to labor relations in the federal sector as it is in the private sector, namely, an employer's obligation to bargain over negotiable matters before making changes in the working conditions of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.873" offset="630723">The case also involves the relationship between Section 7117 of Title VII, which describes the substantive scope of bargaining in the federal sector and establishes administrative procedures for resolving scope of bargaining or negotiability issues, and the statutory unfair labor practice provisions which make it an unfair labor practice for a federal employer to refuse to bargain in good faith and also establish procedures for adjudicating unfair labor practice cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.883" offset="750782">In this case, when respondent Aberdeen Proving Ground announced that it would curtail operations the day after Thanksgiving and that employees would be placed on forced annual leave for that day, the exclusive representative of Aberdeen's employees proposed that the employees instead be granted administrative leave for that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.817" offset="826433">Aberdeen refused to bargain on the union's proposals, stating that agency regulations precluded a grant of administrative leave in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.212" offset="860078">In the unfair labor practice case that ensued, the Authority reexamined and reaffirmed its previous holdings that the authority is empowered to resolve in a unilateral change unfair labor practice proceeding an employer agency's defense that bargaining is barred by an agency regulation for which a compelling need exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.436" offset="944924">The Authority's consistent holdings on this point are, we submit, faithful to the text and the purposes of the Authority's enabling Act, consistent with the Authority's undisputed ability to resolve other negotiability differences in unilateral change unfair labor practice cases, consistent with the practice under the executive order program that predated Title VII, and constitute an appropriate harmonizing of the negotiability and unfair labor practice provisions of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.736" offset="1066132">However, respondent Aberdeen argues that compelling need issues alone among all the negotiability defenses available to an employer may only be resolved in the appeal procedures established in Section 7117, and indeed that the employer's obligation to bargain is not even triggered until the Authority resolves the compelling need issue in the negotiability appeal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.333" offset="1164562">Aberdeen's proffered view of Section 7117 cannot be squared with the structure, the purposes, and the history of that provision and would not give effect to the unfair labor practice provisions of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.901" offset="1458805">For example, Section 7117(a)(1) of the statute provides that the duty to bargain does not encompass proposals that would bring about an inconsistency with federal law or government-wide regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.660" offset="1513871">Also excluded from the duty to bargain are proposals that would improperly intrude on the exercise of the management rights listed in Section 7106, and the statute in Section 7117(c) establishes a negotiability appeal procedure for resolving those kinds of scope of bargaining questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.372" offset="1588686">The statute in Section 7117(a)(2) also excludes from the bargaining obligation proposals which would bring about an inconsistency only with those regulations for which there is a compelling need, and Section 7117(b) establishes an appeal procedure for resolving this type of negotiability issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.931" offset="3778896">It is apparent from the text and structure of Section 7117 that these provisions have as their object purpose to describe the substantive scope of the bargaining obligation and to provide procedures for resolving negotiability issues, and this purpose is as apparent in the compelling need provisions as in the other parts of Section 7117.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.364" offset="3860712">The Authority gives effect to these provisions by construing Section 7117 as providing the appropriate forum for resolving negotiability issues that emanate from ongoing collective bargaining negotiations when no unilateral change issues are involved, but given the purpose of the provisions, to describe and determine the extent of the bargaining obligation, it seems difficult indeed to view any word or part of these provisions as establishing a condition precedent for the duty to bargain or as defining when the duty to bargain arises, and any attempt to read the terms of Section 7117 as precluding the resolution of compelling need issues in unilateral change cases must begin with the acknowledgement that not a single word in Section 7117 explicitly addresses the relationship between that section and the unfair labor practice provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.904" offset="4094873">As the D.C. Circuit recently noted in NLPBU versus FLRA, cited in our reply brief, the relationship between the statute's negotiability provisions and its unfair labor practice procedures is profoundly ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.663" offset="4153910">In this context the Authority's construction of the statutory terms to give effect to both the negotiability and the unfair labor practice provisions surely must pass a test of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.809" offset="4202498">The Authority's construction of the statute draws further support from the historical development of the compelling need test, which was introduced during the executive order era in order to broaden the scope of bargaining and to limit the availability of agency regulations as a bar to bargaining, and indeed, given the stringent criteria developed by the authority, like its executive order predecessor for evaluating compelling need, and given that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating the existence of a compelling need, agency regulations serve as one of the least restrictive bars to bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.617" offset="4361636">In this context, it would seem incongruous to view Congress as intending that compelling need determinations serve as a condition precedent to the triggering of the bargaining obligation or to view compelling need determinations as the sole negotiability defense that may not be resolved in a unilateral change unfair labor practice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.861" offset="4446691">In addition, the Authority's practice of resolving negotiability defenses, including compelling need defenses in a unilateral change unfair labor practice case derives support from consideration of important public policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.262" offset="4508235">First, the effective administration of the statute is fostered when all the issues, including all the employer's negotiability defenses, can be resolved in one proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1113.525" offset="4585349">But furthermore, and indeed the D.C. Circuit in upholding the Authority's view in Defense Logistics Agency considered the second point perhaps even more important access to the unfair labor practice forum affords employees and their union access to appropriate remedies for an employer's unilateral change in working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.569" offset="4665492">As the D.C.

            <label>Ms. Ruth E. Peters</label>
            <text syncTime="1262.100" offset="5179582">Well, I think it must be read in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.470" offset="5189091">It cannot be taken out of Section 7117 in its entirety, and it seems to me that that provision, placing the emphasis on that word, for example, could lead one to the conclusion that, for example, when an agency makes alternative arguments about a single bargaining proposal alleging both Section 7117(b) defenses and Section 7117(c) defenses, that the Authority would have to hold two proceedings there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.640" offset="5305806">But of course the Authority has always, and has never been subject to challenge so far as I know, conducted unified proceedings addressing all negotiability issues in one proceeding, and it would also seem to suggest perhaps that every agency regulation out there that touches on conditions of employment would have to somehow walk through the Authority's door before bargaining could begin, and for example... and there is certainly no thought of that so far as I know in the federal sector program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.340" offset="5420535">In fact, the Fourth Circuit's first decision, the Fort Belvoir decision, arose when the subordinate level in the union requested a waiver of the higher level agency and the waiver was denied, but certainly it describes a fact pattern where parties felt free to seek a waiver on an agency regulation rather than going to the Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.419" offset="5524921">The Authority said that only it and only in that proceeding could decide a compelling need issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.001" offset="5543206">So it seems to me that first of all there is no plain language that would assist us, unfortunately, in the construction of these statutory terms, and that even if they were, they could not be read as overriding the purposes of the statute as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.206" offset="5624082">Finally, I would just want to note that there are no drawbacks resulting from the Authority's practice of resolving compelling need issues in unilateral change cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.745" offset="5678207">Aberdeen's suggestion that a determination of compelling need issues in the unfair labor practice forum somehow restricts the Agency ability to regulate its affairs is simply without basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.322" offset="5724496">The Authority's case law makes clear that an agency is not barred from promulgating regulations or even from disseminating these regulations to subordinate levels of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.760" offset="5766292">The agency's regulations also do fix the rights and obligations within the agency, including within the bargaining unit, unless the employer and the union agree otherwise in collective negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.446" offset="5816970">And the only requirement on the employer is the statutory one to bargain before implementation of the agency regulation as to the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.743" offset="5854168">Further, if a compelling need is found the employer will not be required to bargain over inconsistent proposals and even if there is no compelling need found and the Authority orders that the change be rescinded, such a remedy would only deprive the employer of the results of a unilateral change that it should have not made in the first place without bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.096" offset="5935566">In short, as the D.C. Circuit opined in Defense Logistics Agency, the Authority has good reasons for its construction of its enabling statute, reasons that are firmly rooted in the terms and the history and the purposes of the statute, and that give effect to both the negotiability and the unfair labor practice provisions in this enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.319" offset="6016441">We respectfully request that the Authority's construction of the statute be upheld, and also that the judgment of the court below be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.670" offset="6073910">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.985" offset="6107138">The Authority has reached an interpretive impasse in this case because it embarked on the wrong path at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.510" offset="6141202">Correctly viewed, this case does not require the Court to seek out private labor law analogs or delve into pre-Act legislative history or balance free-floating notions of efficiency or general public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.110" offset="6203686">This is instead a case about the plain meaning of a statute that speaks directly to the question presented and answers, and the answer that the statute provides is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.210" offset="6256036">A proceeding under Section 7117(b) is the only means by which to challenge the compelling need for an agency-wide regulation when such a regulation is asserted as a bar to federal sector collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.680" offset="6317894">I would like to begin with the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.143" offset="6331791">Right up front, Section 7117(a)(2) states that the duty to bargain in good faith shall extend to matters that are the subject of agency-wide regulations only if the Authority has determined under Subsection (b) there is no compelling need for the regulation at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.616" offset="6417682">These words are not silent, nor are they, as the Authority suggests in its reply brief, merely the starting point for analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.143" offset="6455820">Only if the Authority has determined the compelling need issue does the duty to bargain in good faith arise at all with respect to agency-wide regulation matters, and only, as the Fourth Circuit put it in the Fort Belvoir decision, is a "highly singular" word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.967" offset="6535128">It doesn't suggest that there are lots of other ways to do the same thing, and as we read the statute and as we read its plain language, unless and until that compelling need determination has been made there is simply no duty to bargain at all with respect to matters covered by the regulations, and thus the Authority's assertion throughout its brief that there is this thing called a continuing duty to bargain is misplaced in this context because the bargaining duty cannot continue unless and until it first arises, and it doesn't arise under the statute until the compelling need determination has been made, and not just made in any way the Authority sees fit to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.683" offset="6697923">It says quite explicitly it must be made under Subsection (b), not in the ULP forum, not in any other forum, under Subsection (b), and until that determination has been made, the ULP process simply cannot get under way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.817" offset="6774514">We believe the language is plain, and that its purpose is evident and quite sensible, for the ULP process is manifestly inappropriate for resolving disputes concerning the compelling need for agency-wide regulations, and the facts of this case illustrate my point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.901" offset="6850792">Here a federal agency, the Department of Defense and its primary national subdivision, the Department of the Army, promulgated regulations governing anticipated closures at agency facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.288" offset="6900320">The machinists and aerospace workers contended that those regulations lacked a compelling need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.763" offset="6922263">When it made that claim, it asserted in effect two propositions, first, that the Army and the Defense Department could not apply the regulations, their regulations in a Particular case that they plainly intended to cover, and second, that the local employer, here Aberdeen Proving Grounds, may not follow a regulation that its parent agency explicitly directed it to obey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.590" offset="7033544">A union asserts both such propositions every time it asserts that an agency-wide regulation lacks a compelling need, and in our judgment that tells us two things about what an ideal system ought to look like for resolving compelling need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.742" offset="7098224">First, the ideal system ought to entitle the agency that issued the regulation a chance to be heard on the question whether its regulation has a compelling justification and deserves to be applied according to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.842" offset="7158619">It shouldn't just be a fortuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.523" offset="7165306">It shouldn't just be up to the agency if it feels like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.856" offset="7178681">It should be right in the statute and be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.706" offset="7190070">And second, the system, the ideal system should not saddle the local employer with an unfair labor practice simply because it obeyed a regulation that its parent agency directed it to follow, and in our view that is just exactly the system that Congress enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.840" offset="7266557">First, Section 7117(a)(2) says that there is no duty to bargain unless and until the Authority has made a compelling need determination under Subsection (b) and that is just another way of saying that the local employer cannot be charged with the ULP simply because it has followed its parent's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.835" offset="7350566">Second, Section 7117(b) creates a procedure that entitles the issuing agency to be heard on the question whether its regulation passes the compelling need test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.753" offset="7402184">Under Subsection (b)(3) a hearing may be heard at which the issuing agency is a necessary party, at which the general counsel who is the prosecutor in the ULP forum is not entitled to be present, and in which the only issue to be determined is the question of compelling need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.595" offset="7477626">Now, earlier during the argument I believe Justice O'Connor put a question to Ms. Peters concerning whether there is any relevant legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.024" offset="7531334">We believe there is, and it is not just legislative history of the sort that is a filigree on the plain meaning of the statute, but it was Congress's explicit answer to the question presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.745" offset="7586191">Now, to be sure, as Ms. Peters notes, correctly, the answer was given in the context of a predecessor statute, one in which the compelling need language was used with respect to government-wide regulations and not agency-wide regulations, but the statutory language with respect to compelling need was identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.380" offset="7664767">It was the same exact substantive test, the compelling need procedures were identical, and the House took up the question whether the ULP forum would be available to resolve the compelling need questions for government-wide regulations, and this is the answer they gave:</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.401" offset="7736865">"The Committee intends that disputes concerning the negotiability of proposals and matters affecting working conditions except for questions of compelling need under Section 7117 be resolved through the filing and processing of unfair labor practice charges under Section 7116 and 7118. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.539" offset="7841355">That is the answer to the question presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.361" offset="7856611">Now, that answer doesn't go away simply because Congress didn't enact the version of Section 7117 that was in the House bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.589" offset="7889525">Indeed, there is good reason to think the answer is even more relevant given what they did subsequently, because the scope of the bargaining obligation got smaller after the House bill was put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.488" offset="7941143">The government-wide regulations became a complete bar to negotiations, and agency-wide regulations, which had previously not been a bar at all under the prior bill, became a bar to the extent they were justified by compelling need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.319" offset="7996522">So the fact, it seems to me, that the prior bill didn't become law doesn't argue for overlooking the meaning that the... or in this case the House of Representatives imposed on the identical language that confronts the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.759" offset="8054201">Let me say also with respect to the 7117(c) argument that has been made, the Authority takes the view, and has taken the view this morning that because under Section 7117(c) there are these optional alternative procedures either in the ULP forum or in the so-called negotiability appeal forum, that therefore the same option ought to exist with respect to compelling need, we don't think the plain language of those statutes can absorb that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.792" offset="8182410">Indeed, in our view the contrast between these provisions underscores the argument we make this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.326" offset="8208532">For unlike Section 7117(b) which states that the Authority shall determine compelling need in any collective bargaining dispute in which it arises, Section 7117(c) provides that if with respect to any other negotiability dispute an agency alleges that there is no duty to bargain in good faith, the union may appeal under the expedited negotiability procedures detailed in the balance of Section 7117(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.786" offset="8330367">There is no language in Section (c) that is comparable to that in Section (b), nothing that is... that commands the Authority that it shall determine negotiability when a compelling need issue is the bar that is asserted by the agency, and nor for that matter does Section 7117(c) state as (a)(2) does that the duty to bargain in good faith does not arise at all unless and until the Authority has determined the negotiability issue in the expedited compelling need process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.000" offset="8471220">All Section 7117(c) does is to give the union an option, an option that finds no analogy whatever in the compelling need provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.157" offset="8515837">We believe that contrast is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.979" offset="8527122">The fact that Congress carved out one type of negotiability dispute in which it made an affirmative demand to the Authority that it shall determine it and determine it in a particular way, and in all other negotiability cases gave an explicit option to resort to either forum suggests that Congress didn't simply back into the plain language of the statute, but chose and chose deliberately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.846" offset="8634642">And as I suggested before, it chose wisely, because compelling need determinations for agency-wide regulations are an unusual and unique type of dispute which deserves and ought to be resolved in a special expedited forum in which the issuing agency has the right, the statutory right to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.350" offset="8720637">Let me say a brief word about the argument the Authority makes with respect to the executive order practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.285" offset="8748326">This argument, as I understand it, suggests that because there existed under the executive order regime a right in the Assistant Secretary of Labor to decide all negotiability issues, that that same power must reside in an ALJ to decide compelling need questions in the ULP forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.351" offset="8828575">That argument, we believe, is wrong for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.221" offset="8844144">First, it misstates the historical record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.705" offset="8858041">It is true, to be sure, that Executive Order 11838 gave the Assistant Secretary the power to decide negotiability issues that had previously arisen during disputes but which had theretofore been outside his jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.204" offset="8920003">But there is no reason at all to believe that that power also entitled him to decide compelling need questions in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.490" offset="8953126">Quite the contrary is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.780" offset="8962322">For at the same time that Executive Order 11838 empowered the Assistant Secretary to decide negotiability questions in general, it also created a separate and distinct and quite detailed procedure for resolving the compelling need for agency-wide regulations in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.893" offset="9038808">Previously agency regulations had been a complete bar to negotiations under the executive order practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.387" offset="9068797">Executive Order 11838 relaxed that limitation but did so in a particular and, we believe, in a deliberate compromise fashion by giving the jurisdiction to the Federal Labor Relation Council, the Authority's predecessor, and only under particular procedural circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.812" offset="9146433">There is no hint that the Assistant Secretary of Labor also inherited that new power at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.807" offset="9174436">But even if the Authority's interpretation of the executive order practice were correct, and we believe it isn't, there is no persuasive reason to think that Congress intended to enact the same Procedure, for it didn't adopt the language, and as the Court of Appeals observed in the decision in Fort Belvoir, Congress clearly had this executive order practice before it when it enacted Title VII, and yet far from adopting the same procedures, it instead adopted the language that we now find in Section (a)(2) and (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.089" offset="9319572">The Authority offers no convincing explanation how the superseded language of the executive order, which in our view it in any event misconstrues, can overcome the plain meaning of the compelling need provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.700" offset="11714060">It seems to me Congress couldn't have said what it meant any more clearly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2923.601" offset="11825655">Indeed, I think it is sufficiently clear that there is really no need to turn to the very definitive legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.407" offset="11860869">Let me just say that in conclusion that the error in our judgment that the Authority has made today is the same one it made in BATF that came before this Court five years ago, and though it requests this Court's deference, we believe what this Court said in that case remains true today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.623" offset="11953655">The deference owed to an expert tribunal cannot be allowed to slip into a judicial inertia which results in the unauthorized assumption by an agency of major policy decisions properly made by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2978.970" offset="12047069">I have just a few brief points to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.380" offset="12056682">First of all, respondent has suggested that the ideal system that Congress had in mind was the issuing agency as a necessary party to any compelling need determination by the Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.512" offset="12121257">I would suggest that if Congress had that ideal system in mind it would have made it plain, as it were, by requiring that in the statute, but in fact it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.218" offset="12160127">The only reference to agencies as necessary parties are when the Authority in its discretion holds hearings under Section 7117(b), and the Authority to my knowledge ordinarily does not and in fact has not held hearings in those types... in that type of appeal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.781" offset="12226374">Secondly, I would again just emphasize that the is no plain language in 7117.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.315" offset="12256467">There is not a single word that directly and explicitly discusses the relationship between Section 7117 and the unfair labor practice procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.811" offset="12490420">Yes, that is... I had thought that perhaps the agency would only hold a hearing if it was... as many courts might, that they would be, for example, very reluctant to reverse the Court below without full argument, but would be willing to affirm without setting the case for argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.765" offset="12574220">You are telling me that that is not the key to whether you have a hearing or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.717" offset="12586028">No, the Authority makes the compelling need determination, not the issuing agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.121" offset="12603686">The Authority issues the regulations and applies those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.386" offset="12624793">Secondly, as to the respondent's point that the Authority has yet to make an argument based on the statute, I would say that that is simply incorrect, and would direct the Court's attention not only to the arguments made by counsel but to the Authority's decision which discusses explicit terms of the statute and decides on the basis of those terms that there is a distinction between ongoing negotiation where negotiability defenses must be raised through the appeal procedure and unilateral change situations where they can be raised in the unfair labor practice procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.820" offset="12774527">And in terms of the respondent's notion that Congress explicitly considered and rejected the practice that we have suggested, again, we would suggest that that is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.641" offset="12833773">Not only was the legislative proposal for compelling need for government-wide regulations not enacted, but there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that those types of negotiability determinations which would have been the only ones left under that legislative proposal could not be made in the unfair labor practice proceeding in a unilateral change context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.447" offset="12928963">It simply indicates, and in fact the Court in Defense Logistics Agency found support in the legislative history to indicate that even those compelling need determinations were directed only at the ongoing negotiations scenario, and not necessarily at the unilateral change situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.539" offset="13001375">And so not only was it not... not enacted, but there is simply nothing in the proposal that would support the respondent's argument here, and in terms of their reliance upon the difference of language in Section 7117(b) that the Authority shall determine compelling need issues and the language in 7117(c) that the union may appeal, we would point out that those provisions simply aren't parallel, and contrary to the respondent, there is a parallel provision in Section 7117(c) which, of course, directs the Authority that it shall determine those issues, too, when they are presented to the Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.906" offset="13158841">That provision is in Section 7117(c)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.190" offset="13175977">Whereas the language 7117(c) simply indicates that the union need not appeal but can issue a counterproposal or bargain on the employer's proposal or withdraw its proposal or do whatever it wishes instead of appealing, and also that that optional language prevents the 15-day time limit from automatically being triggered if there is an allegation of nonnegotiability in the Section 7117(c) proceeding.</text>
