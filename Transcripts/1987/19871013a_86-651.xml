            <text syncTime="60.789" offset="382356">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.907" offset="394790">This is an action that was commenced by the Respondent Employer under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, in an attempt to overturn an arbitration award that was rendered pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the Petitioner Union and the Employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.035" offset="475247">The question that is presented to this Court is whether the courts are free in such an action to relieve one party to a lawful collective bargaining agreement, as that agreement has been interpreted by the arbitrator, to relieve a party of his obligations under the contract of the theory that there is some public policy against enforcing that lawful contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.020" offset="575244">The facts out of which that question arises can be briefly summarized, and in light of the conclusory labels that have been tossed around in the briefs, are of some particular importance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.476" offset="617040">In February of 1983, the company discharged an employee by the name of Isiah Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.880" offset="642640">The stated ground for the discharge was that Mr. Cooper had been seen possessing a marijuana cigarette in a car in the company's parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.486" offset="685063">And the company maintained that that established a violation of a work rule promulgated against the company, which rule prohibits an employee from bringing marijuana onto company premises or using marijuana or alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.161" offset="739815">The union filed a grievance alleging that the discharge was without just cause and therefore in breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.184" offset="771894">And that grievance was submitted to arbitration and the auspices of the Federal Mediation Conciliation Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.005" offset="795195">The arbitrator found as a matter of fact that the company had failed to prove a violation of the work rule in the manner respected: the employee was not guilty of either bringing that marijuana cigarette onto company property or smoking that cigarette.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.431" offset="860919">The arbitrator noted that the company at the hearing had attempted to defend the discharge on a new ground by claiming that there was evidence that tracings of marijuana had been found in a plastic bag in the employee's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.107" offset="919538">But the arbitrator said that he would not consider that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.011" offset="939182">He explained that the just cause provision of the contract was to be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning of that phrase, "in industrial relations", and just cause prohibits an employee from introducing new grounds that were not raised at the time of the discharge or at any time in the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.723" offset="1010026">So having therefore found that the only question that was before him... the company had failed to make out its proof... the arbitrator ordered the employee reinstated with back pay, and this lawsuit followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.280" offset="1064256">The employer succeeded in persuading the lower courts to vacate the arbitration award.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.851" offset="1086512">Now it is important to note that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals quarreled with the job that the arbitrator had done as the interpreter of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.373" offset="1124651">That is, they accepted the validity of his conclusion that the employer here had promised that it would not discharge an employee unless it was able to prove the grounds on which the discharge was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.930" offset="1170836">The court also did not question the fact that the employer was perfectly free to enter into that promise; there is nothing in the law to prohibit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.386" offset="1204690">And he was free in this instance to live up to his promise; there was nothing in the law that makes it unlawful for him to take this employee back.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.309" offset="1236351">But the courts nonetheless concluded that it was against public policy for them to hold the employer to his promise, and the particular public policy they cited is</text>
            <text syncTime="284.950" offset="1278983">"the public policy against the operation of dangerous machinery by persons under the influence of drugs or alcohol. "</text>
            <text syncTime="291.938" offset="1306881">Now it is our principal submission here that in arrogating to itself this kind of power, to refuse to enforce a lawful collective bargaining agreement, the lower courts have overstepped the limits of their authority under Section 301 of--</text>

            <text syncTime="412.681" offset="1789833">We do believe, however, that if the legislature has not gone that far and has stated a public policy at the general level of, for example, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, that it is not consistent with the labor relations system, and it is not appropriate for the courts to attempt to elaborate upon that policy by trying to decide whether that policy would or would not be served or disserved--</text>

            <text syncTime="461.113" offset="1983557">So that if the FAA says that this person should not be flying, then clearly an arbitrator's award that puts that person back to work would not be entitled to enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.533" offset="2017308">But it is precisely our point that if the FAA has said that, yes, it's okay for this person to fly, and the employer has promised that he will take this person back... at least the arbitrator has told us that's what his promise means... that the court should not put themselves in the business of trying to... of second guessing the FAA and substituting their view of what is sound for the party's view or the FAA's view.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.626" offset="2385634">Because in that kind of case, the very question that is being decided is, what is the appropriate punishment or penalty for a particular individual who has committed a particular kind of wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.366" offset="2432655">And there is a variety of factors that one might want to take into account in making that judgment, and that is precisely what arbitrators do.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.010" offset="2503185">That is to say, there are some things which you can't write into a contract, they will not be enforced even there is not provision of law which says that they are unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.120" offset="2555639">I mean, there is a long line of contracts cases refusing to enforce contracts as being contrary to public policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.707" offset="3030023">The first is, as we understand the common law notion, the common law notion itself always assumed that whatever common law powers the judges exercise was subject to the subordinate power of a legislature to establish public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.551" offset="3089373">So that in so far as we are right in suggesting, if the Congress did that, when it enacted the National Labor Relations Act and when it created this system of collective bargaining and of grievance arbitration, we think our position is entirely consistent with the principle of the common law doctrine, although I certainly do concede that in a particular case a common law judge would have exercised a broader authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.600" offset="3185608">We also would note that this Court has made clear in other 301 cases that ordinary contract principles do not fit very well to this peculiar 301 context, and should not be binding in fashioning the federal law of labor contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.067" offset="3919440">And so Congress imposed the duty to bargain, and it delimited the subjects of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.553" offset="3937412">And then it said to the parties that so long as the agreement you make is a lawful agreement, you are free to make that agreement and our role is to enforce the agreement, because we think that that is the way for the most conducive set of labor relations.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.609" offset="4065621">I think the difference is this, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.311" offset="4076384">In the ordinary contract context there is a principle of freedom of contract, but there is not a duty to bargain, for example, outside of the labor relations context.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.534" offset="4125285">Congress here commanded bargaining because it viewed contracting... not just it thought it was good for parties to do whatever they wanted, but it thought that this system of self-government was the best way to further a set of public concerns, and was preferable to imposing a set of government regulations on the work place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.413" offset="4196860">So that we think that the philosophy of the NLRA goes quite beyond the philosophy of the law of contracts, and that the most concrete manifestation of that is the duty to bargain, which is unique to the labor relations context, and which, of course, is codified in Section 885.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.707" offset="4266032">The other aspect of labor relations policy is this encouragement of private dispute resolution, of arbitration instead of litigation, and as this Court explained in the Steelworkers trilogy, that reflects Congress's understanding that it is unrealistic to expect the parties at one time to sit down and develop a set of rules that will govern every situation that arises in this ongoing relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.573" offset="4365402">And Congress said, that instead of encouraging you to run to the courts to resolve these matters, or moreover, instead of your resolving these matters through an ad hoc adjustment of economic forces, what we think the best way to deal with these is for you to get somebody who you trust, who you the parties trust, and empower him to elaborate on your contract and develop a set of rules, and we will do our best to enforce that system and uphold that system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1106.090" offset="4563515">At the threshold, Justice Scalia, as National Academy develops in its brief amicus curiae, in a discharge case the issue that is entrusted to the arbitrator, the just cause issue necessarily asks the arbitrator to take into account the variety of public policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.217" offset="4632060">Arbitrators treat cases that involve employees who are dangerous very differently than they treat an employee who has thrown a spitball in the plant, and they do so because they have an understanding of public policy and that the party has expected those kinds of considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.394" offset="4692769">Certainly, arbitrators can do that, they should do that, they do do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.279" offset="4712308">And it would be part of our submission, the reason why in this case we think it is especially inappropriate to authorize the courts into this area, is that there is no principle by which a judge can say that in this particular case, this individual has done something so serious that he shouldn't be put back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.490" offset="4781167">It requires a very particularized judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.842" offset="4794542">You want to know what he did, were there any extenuating circumstances, what's his past record, what is his likelihood of repetition: that's precisely the question the arbitrator asks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.484" offset="4833099">And the arbitrator does so because the parties have empowered him to do so because they trust him to render their judgment for them, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.738" offset="4866117">And if the courts get involved in this area, what the courts are going to wind up doing is simply redoing what the arbitrator has done, and substituting not some rule of law they can apply in any kind of neutral way, but their best judgment for the arbitrator's judgement and ultimately, for the parties' judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.134" offset="4939678">And we suggest that there is no basis for taking from the parties their right to make their own decisions on, at what point is somebody sufficiently dangerous or sufficiently harmful or sufficiently evil that he shouldn't go back to work, and substituting a court's resolution of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.311" offset="5008432">A resolution which, as I say, can't be animated by any kind of principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="3299.869" offset="13338672">I am going to give you the hardest case I can think of and see whether you'll adhere to your principle.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Silberman</label>
            <text syncTime="3303.690" offset="13353928">The answer is yes, Justice Scalia.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3306.356" offset="13364586">Well, I want to see how your principle works out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.426" offset="13380886">Let's assume that there's a state law that prevents the employment of anyone that has a history of child molestation in a day care center.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.747" offset="13410144">And there's a contract with the union; the contract says anyone can be fired for a history of child molestation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.519" offset="13441281">But the contract also says that any disciplining for any matter that involves moral opprobrium shall only be made on the testimony of three witnesses to the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.779" offset="13502304">Now there is one individual... it is clear on the basis of a lot evidence, photographic, documentary, and everything else, the fellow has a long history of child molestation, but in no one of these instances were there three eye witnesses to the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.990" offset="13571162">And the thing goes to arbitration, the arbitrator says, that's the way the contract reads, you don't have the three witnesses, that's not the evidence the contract requires, you can't be fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.680" offset="13605853">A court would have to enforce that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_silberman" startTime="3370.715" stopTime="3374.619">
            <label>Mr. David Silberman</label>
            <text syncTime="3370.715" offset="13622049">No, I don't think our principle reaches that conclusion,--</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>

            <label>Mr. David Silberman</label>
            <text syncTime="3375.352" offset="13640544">--Because if... I need to break that hypothetical down into two possible scenarios.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.606" offset="13661546">One is where the arbitrator has made factual findings which says that this guy is guilty of these acts, but that I don't have the authority to sustain the discharge--</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3390.796" stopTime="3420.381">
            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3390.796" offset="13702297">No, he hasn't made the finding, but the court that reviews the thing can see that that is absolutely the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.865" offset="13722568">But he hasn't found that, he has just said, you didn't meet the procedural rules, just as the arbitrator here said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.769" offset="13750258">But the point is that those procedural rules make it so difficult for the employer to enforce the public policy that the argument is a contract with that unrealistic a condition for dismissing somebody for the reason the law requires is contrary to public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.231" offset="13816086">You would not allow that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_silberman" startTime="3420.381" stopTime="3453.869">
            <label>Mr. David Silberman</label>
            <text syncTime="3420.381" offset="13820684">--No, I think that if... as I understand the hypothetical... there is a prohibition on employing a particular individual and a procedural rule in a contract which leads an arbitrator to order the employment of an individual who public law says is not to be employed, then it is entirely consistent with... our principle would say that award is against public policy because it is ordering the employer to do something he is not permitted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.298" offset="13924338">Even though the contract itself was lawful, the remedy... the order there ordered the employer to do something he is not permitted to do.</text>
