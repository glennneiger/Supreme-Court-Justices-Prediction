            <text syncTime="12.449" offset="188781">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.322" offset="200275">This is the Court's first encounter with the unique attorneys' fee statute, the Equal Access to Justice Act, or EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.132" offset="227547">EAJA reflects an attempt by Congress to balance two competing objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.676" offset="245728">On the one hand, Congress was concerned that individuals and small businesses might be discouraged from challenging unreasonable Government action because they could not afford the expense of hiring an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.361" offset="288464">On the other hand, Congress thought that if attorneys' fees were routinely awarded against the Government in a case where the Government was not the prevailing party, this might inhibit vigorous enforcement of the law, or chill attempts by the Government to advance in good faith novel but credible extensions and interpretations of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.948" offset="362757">In an effort to accommodate these two competing objectives, Congress adopted two provisions which are both at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.208" offset="395775">First, EAJA does not award attorneys' fees to everyone who prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.331" offset="412285">It specifically provides that an award of fees is available only if the Government takes a position that is not substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.751" offset="437989">Second, although EAJA provides that an attorney's fee must be reasonable, it imposes a cap on what is considered to be a reasonable attorney's fee equal to $75.00 an hour, which can be exceeded only because of inflation or other narrowly defined special factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="103.788" offset="554182">The first issue in this case, however, is the meaning of "substantial justification".</text>
            <text syncTime="107.677" offset="569751">The legislative history makes it clear that in general the Government's position is substantially justified if it is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.236" offset="595978">Thus, even if the Government ultimately loses the case, it is not required to pay attorneys' fees under EAJA if its position was one as to which reasonable persons might genuinely disagree about the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.809" offset="646237">The 1980 legislative history repeatedly equates substantial justification with reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.182" offset="667762">Eleven Courts of Appeals interpreted "substantially justified" to mean "reasonable".</text>
            <text syncTime="135.931" offset="682704">When EAJA was re-enacted in 1985, several minor changes were made in the statutory language, but Congress maintained the substantial justification formula without modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.926" offset="722724">Thus, we think that the meaning of "substantial justification", at least in the abstract, is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.613" offset="741428">It means "reasonable".</text>
            <text syncTime="151.955" offset="746861">The difficulty comes in applying this standard in individual cases, as this case illustrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.780" offset="770162">Here, looking at virtually identical facts, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Secretary of HUD was not substantially justified in refusing to implement the operating subsidy program authorized by Congress in 1974, and subsequently repealed in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.915" offset="834633">The Second Circuit, however, held that the Secretary was substantially justified in refusing to implement that subsidy.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="180.288" offset="860128">Is there any reason why Congress didn't use the perfectly good word "reasonable", if it meant "reasonable"?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_w_merrill" startTime="185.693" stopTime="283.044">
            <label>Mr. Thomas W. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="185.693" offset="881757">Well, Justice Scalia, the legislative history suggests that the substantially justified formula was borrowed verbatim from Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.437" offset="932748">And I think there is also some indication in the legislative history that Congress was particularly attracted to that because it was clear under that formulation that the Government had the burden, and Congress was particularly anxious to establish that the Government had the burden of showing it as substantially justified, or reasonable, or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.352" offset="1004428">Now, obviously, they could have done that by saying the Government has the burden of showing that it is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.444" offset="1024804">But Congress chose not to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.974" offset="1034940">There is an episode in the legislative history, the 1980 legislative history, which is discussed in the briefs, where the Senate, without explanation, the Senate committee, rejected an amendment that would changed "substantially justified" to "reasonably justified", but there is no explanation for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.264" offset="1104007">And the Senate Committee Report goes on to say that "substantially justified" means "reasonable".</text>
            <text syncTime="245.495" offset="1120935">So I cannot answer the question any better than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.010" offset="1139011">There are a number of reasons why in this case we think the Second Circuit was right and the Ninth Circuit wrong in the substantial justification inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.538" offset="1177150">First of all, the Secretary's decision not to implement the operating subsidy was quintessentially a policy choice about what to do with limited resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.660" offset="1213617">Although Congress had authorized the Secretary to enter into contracts to implement the operating subsidy program, it had not released sufficient contract authority to permit the Secretary to implement that subsidy program and to meet her commitments under other programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.697" offset="1301806">Ironically, Justice White, there is a pending application or motion, I guess, before the District Court in California to award fees for the expense of engaging in the fee litigation in this case; and if our theory is right about what "substantially justified" means, we should be able to win that litigation because of the conflict in the Circuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.627" offset="1377457">Mr. Merrill, may I ask what standard we should use to review the lower court's finding that the Government's litigating position was not substantially justified?</text>
            <text syncTime="324.809" offset="1438270">Is it an abuse of discretion thing or do we look at it de novo as a matter of law, or does it vary from case to case, depending on whether it is a matter of failure to meet a burden of proof or a legal question?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas W. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="342.646" offset="1509532">Certainly we think that in this case the appropriate standard is de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.129" offset="1523534">Most of the lower courts that have considered this question have so concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.940" offset="1542760">A few lower courts, including the Ninth Circuit, have held that an abuse of discretion standard is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.547" offset="1565225">We think a de novo standard is particularly critical at this stage, or with respect to the issues involved in this case, because the primary thrust of our argument here is that the Court should, if at all possible, try to construe the "substantially justified" requirement in terms of objective indicators of reasonableness, and if the courts are to develop such objective indicators of reasonableness, it is important that we have appellate review of decisions as to what kinds of circumstances constitute substantial justification and which kinds do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.393" offset="1700540">If everything is simply left up to the ad hoc discretion of the trial courts, then we will be faced with a totality of the circumstances kind of approach in almost every instance, which we argue is highly wasteful and duplicative.</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.895" offset="5398538">We certainly would not want the Court to change its standards in response to attorneys' fee litigation, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.064" offset="5431243">The stay situation is, quite frankly, probably somewhat of an unusual one in EAJA litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.452" offset="5460814">I think that a much more common situation that the Government encounters is one where there is some kind of disagreement among the courts on the question and our approach of objective indicators I think would only in an unusual case involve assessments of stay and certiorari grants, and much more commonly would involve things like whether or not a disagreement among lower court judges was sufficient to establish the reasonableness of the Government's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.849" offset="5562378">There are really two issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.787" offset="5566140">One is whether or not the objective indicators approach makes sense, as a general matter, and secondly, whether or not, in this case, the stay and the certiorari grants were bona fide objective indicators of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.985" offset="5614936">We would strongly urge the Court to consider the utility of the objective indicators approach, and even if the Court disagrees with us about the stay and the certiorari grant, we think that, when you look at the total circumstances in this case, that our action was substantially justified from that perspective as well as under an objective indicators analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.086" offset="5703335">Let me turn, if I may, to the second issue in this case, which is whether or not the lower courts properly adjusted the fees to levels as high as $120.00 an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.863" offset="5750460">EAJA is unique among attorneys' fee statutes in that it imposes an cap on reasonable attorneys' fees equal to $75.00 an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.125" offset="5783478">The statute sets forth two exceptions to the cap: first a finding that there has been an increase in the cost of living, and second, a finding that a special factor such as the limited availability of qualified counsel for the proceedings involved requires a higher fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.104" offset="5835410">The lower courts in this case we think all but wrote the $75.00 cap out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.805" offset="5858188">In effect, they found that the EAJA permits courts to look to any and all of the 12 factors that were identified in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express in making upward adjustments above and beyond the $75.00 limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.909" offset="5914613">The problem with this approach is that the Johnson factors were designed to establish reasonable attorneys' fees in a situation where there is no cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.530" offset="5945124">Thus, if each of the Johnson factors can be taken into account as a special factor which justifies an increase above the $75.00 limit, the net effect would be the same as if Congress had mandated no cap at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.588" offset="5989323">Moreover, there is nothing in the legislative history of EAJA that suggests that Congress wanted the courts to look at the 12 Johnson factors in deciding whether to go beyond the $75.00 cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.584" offset="6029343">In this respect, EAJA is quite different from the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fee Act, 42 U.S.C. 1988, for the legislative history, as this Court has recently discussed in several cases, expressly refers to and incorporates or endorses at least the Johnson factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.625" offset="6089529">By a curious logic, the Respondents have said that they are entitled to more than $75.00 because they satisfied the one special factor mentioned in the statute... to wit, the limited availability of qualified counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.634" offset="6149506">But their argument is that there was a limited availability of attorneys that were willing to serve in this case pro bono.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.475" offset="6172912">They have not submitted any evidence, and the lower courts did not find, that there was a limited availability of counsel at established market rates or at $75.00 an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.817" offset="6202273">That, we submit, is the relevant question under EAJA, and the fact that there is no evidence in the record supporting that demonstrates that Respondents were entitled to fees, at most, no higher than $75.00 per hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.842" offset="6262355">With the Court's permission, I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.646" offset="6489620">As this Court said in Garcia v. United States, and in Blum versus Stenson, Committee Reports are the best source of legislative history for the intent of Congress.</text>

          <turn speaker="thomas_w_merrill" startTime="2929.028" stopTime="3191.848">
            <label>Mr. Thomas W. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="2929.028" offset="11855067">Let me first briefly address the three factors that Respondents have relied on from the legislative history in support of a finding that the Government was no substantially justified in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.631" offset="11917552">First is the string of District Court Opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.488" offset="11936987">We agree that in the proper case, where you have a subtle body of authority, that would be something to be taken into account in deciding whether or not the Government was substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.485" offset="11976902">But in this case, what you had was a string of District Court decisions that were, most of them, associated with individual housing projects, all of them rendered in very short order, one after the other, and the Government was vigorously trying to appeal those decisions during the time that the cases were being rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.882" offset="12054538">The Government's choice, if it wanted to obtain appellate review in this situation, was quite limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.911" offset="12078675">They either could continue to fight the District Court actions until they got appellate decision or I guess, as Respondents would have it, we could just simply fold up and concede our case before we got a decision on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.080" offset="12123292">The Secretary felt very strongly that appellate review was warranted and so incurred the additional District Court defeats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.141" offset="12151504">I should point out that in response to some questions from the Bench as to how many final judgments there were against the Secretary, except for the cases that were not appealed on the District Court level, there were no final judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.245" offset="12203958">The two cases decided by the Court of Appeals both resulted in petitions for certiorari that were granted, and before those cases were heard on the merits, the nationwide class action was settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.224" offset="12243873">And so in fact, other than some isolated District Court cases where the Government elected not to appeal, there was no body of finally-determined law in existence at the time this case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.173" offset="12299671">With respect to the settlement, there are really two key variables in understanding the settlement in this case, and I think to illustrate why it is dangerous to treat a settlement as an objective indicator of unreasonableness, first of all, in 1977, Congress substantially amended the operating subsidy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.947" offset="12366753">First of all, it made the operating subsidy program mandatory as to the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.787" offset="12390159">It did not address the situation from 1974 to 1977, but it said starting in 1977, it is mandatory in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.723" offset="12413878">Secondly, Congress made it clear that the reserve fund that had been accumulating... this was the source for the $60 million... could be spent without separate release of contract authority from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.906" offset="12462571">The Secretary up to that time had taken the position that she could not spend the reserve fund without separate contract authority from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.700" offset="12493813">So in light of that clarification of the law, there was no legal impediment to distributing the $60 million at that point in time, there was no real dispute on an ongoing basis about the policy because that had been resolved by Congress, and it made sense to settle the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.258" offset="12548043">Secondly, following up on the elections of 1976, there was a new Secretary of HUD.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.709" offset="12577823">And it is reasonable to conclude that policy differences had a great deal to do with the decision to settle the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.097" offset="12603423">Regarding the District Court's ruling sua sponte in favor of the Plaintiffs, what happened was there was a motion for preliminary injunction that was fully briefed and argued, and after the Judge decided to enter a preliminary injunction, the Judge decided there would be no point in hearing additional argument on a permanent injunction and so entered a permanent injunction without further argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.182" offset="12687746">Given that the issues involved were strictly legal, we don't think this sheds any light one way or another on the weightiness of the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.569" offset="12721287">Turning to the debate about attorneys' fees, and whether or not counsel are entitled to enhanced fees either because of the one special factor identified by Congress or because of the Johnson factors, several points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.203" offset="12787847">First of all, there is no evidence in this case, as Respondent suggests, that there is a limited supply of attorneys who would have taken this case on a win or lose basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.291" offset="12844167">The evidence that was submitted was that there was a limited supply of counsel who would take the case on a pro bono basis, and that we submit is simply not the relevant question under EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.584" offset="12885336">EAJA simply indicates that if there would be difficulty in retaining counsel--</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.848" offset="12906339">Was this realistically the kind of case in which, apart from EAJA, you could get lawyers to handle except on a pro bono basis?</text>

            <text syncTime="3203.219" offset="12951896">But isn't the fact that there are no pro bono lawyers available, doesn't that satisfy the statutory requirement?</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.014" offset="12971018">--We don't think so, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.483" offset="12976974">The statute basically is addressed to the situation where an attorney has been hired for $85.00 or $100.00 an hour and the statutory cap is $75.00 an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.417" offset="13020651">And the issue is whether or not that additional fee was necessary in order to attract counsel in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.383" offset="13044474">In this case, you had counsel hired basically for nothing, and the issue is whether or not we think $75.00 is an adequate fee in that case, not whether or not you would leapfrog above $75.00.</text>
