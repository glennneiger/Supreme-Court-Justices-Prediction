            <label>Mr. Raymond D. Battocchi</label>
            <text syncTime="77.171" offset="448277">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="80.123" offset="460084">This case involves the constitutionality of both clauses of a District of Columbia statute initially enacted by Congress in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.561" offset="501776">After stating the case we propose to divide our argument into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.072" offset="519852">First, we contend that the first clause of the statute, which prohibits the display of specified flags and banners, violates the free speech guarantee of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.771" offset="562693">Second, we contend that the second clause of the statute, which gives the police the power to disperse congregations within these 500-foot zones, violates the First and Fifth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.247" offset="612535">Our third and narrowest, contention is that both clauses violate equal protection, because the Legislature has allowed parties to labor disputes to utter precisely the same speech and precisely the same conduct that Petitioners cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.227" offset="672512">The facts are simple and relatively straightforward: Petitioners are three young political activists.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.123" offset="700097">Each wishes to display signs containing messages critical of foreign governments and their policies and views on the public streets and sidewalks of the District of Columbia within 500 feet of the official government buildings they wish to criticize.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.625" offset="774076">For example, some of the Petitioners who wish to display a pro-Sakharov, or a pro-Solidarity sign on Sakharov Plaza in front of the Soviet Embassy.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.883" offset="823082">One Petitioner wishes to display the American flag there.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.364" offset="836979">Another wishes to display a "stop the killing" sign in front of the Nicaraguan Embassy.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.098" offset="859967">Each Petitioner also wishes to congregate with two or more other people within the 500-foot zones, and each Petitioner is prohibited from either displaying signs or flags or congregating by Section 1115 of the D.C. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.120" offset="928094">There are numerous cases pending in the District of Columbia courts involving prosecutions under both clauses of this statute for displays of signs and congregations at the Soviet and Nicaraguan Embassies.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.961" offset="995385">This is a 1983 suit that was instituted in the district courts seeking declaratory and injunctive relief; the district court on cross-motions for Summary Judgment, upheld both clauses of the statute and dismissed the Complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.591" offset="1057975">The court of appeals in 1973 in the Zaimi case interpreted the first clause of the statute to apply only when there is a "display", of a flag or banner that produces one or more of the enumerated consequences specified later on in the first clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.398" offset="1153165">In this case, the court of appeals, perhaps narrowing that definition further, construed the first clause to apply only to demonstrations in which signs are displayed designed to bring foreign governments into public disrepute or public odium.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.329" offset="1224845">So far as we can tell, neither Respondents nor the federal government challenge that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.364" offset="1248982">In other words, under the first clause, the only thing that is proscribed is the display of a flag or banner or a sign designed or adapted to bring a foreign government into disrepute.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.962" offset="1311363">We note at the outset that under this construction of the first clause, no violence is proscribed: it is not illegal for Petitioners to demonstrate or for anybody else to demonstrate; it is not illegal under the first clause for anybody to engage in any violent conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.005" offset="1387536">There is a reference, and maybe several implications in the brief of the Respondents and the United States' suggesting that the first clause serves an interest in protecting a security of foreign persons and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.505" offset="1453573">The court of appeals itself acknowledged that, in fact, the security interests asserted by the government in the court below was insufficient to justify the first clause; according to the court of appeals, the only conceivable interest that would sustain the validity of the first clause over a First Amendment challenge was the governmental interest in protecting the dignity of foreign persons and properties... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.215" offset="1572378">The essential holding of the court below was that a dignity interest on the part of foreign governments and foreign persons... and by dignity interest, I mean</text>
            <text syncTime="369.933" offset="1619294">"an interest in avoiding peaceful political insults. "</text>
            <text syncTime="373.295" offset="1632773">was not only a legitimate governmental interest, but an interest sufficiently compelling to override Petitioner's claim to First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.992" offset="1671539">With respect to the second clause, the court of appeals narrowed its terms: the second clause on its face gives the police the power to disperse any congregation within the 500 foot zones and sets no limits whatsoever upon that dispersal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.462" offset="1745413">The court of appeals read the dispersal power as</text>
            <text syncTime="406.137" offset="1764117">"limited to those circumstances in which the police reasonably believed a threat to the security or peace of an embassy is present. "</text>
            <text syncTime="416.483" offset="1805495">and held that,</text>
            <text syncTime="417.875" offset="1811033">"so-limited, the second clause suffers from no constitutional infirmities. "</text>
            <text syncTime="423.337" offset="1832871">In our view, the first clause violates the First Amendment for several separate and independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.003" offset="1875607">We note at the outset that what is involved here is political speech on traditional public forums; Petitioners wish to speak out on interests... on issues, involving foreign relations which are of the utmost public concern; they wish to do so at the seat of government, and therefore, in our view, this case involves the exercise of First Amendment rights in their most highly protected form.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.402" offset="1985217">Our first contention in this regard is that the first clause violates the First Amendment because it is viewpoint-discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.237" offset="2020535">The first clause does not prohibit any and all displays of signs and does not prohibit any and all displays designed to communicate ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.965" offset="2067451">The only displays prescribed by the first clause are those which are</text>
            <text syncTime="486.940" offset="2087304">"designed to bring a foreign government or its acts or officers or views, into public odium or public disrepute. "</text>
            <text syncTime="494.504" offset="2117606">In short, Petitioner Brooker can stand in front of the Soviet Embassy and wave the Soviet flag: she cannot wave the American flag.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="504.722" offset="2158461">However, the government says that that is not a viewpoint-discriminatory on any basis established by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.556" offset="2189808">It is simply the policy of the particular embassy in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.999" offset="2203601">And I think also they stated that there are not a lot of people standing in line waiting to wave an American flag in front of the Russian Embassy.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.634" offset="2238083">This statute addresses things that actually happened, not hypothetical situations.</text>

          <turn speaker="raymond_d_battocchi" startTime="529.717" stopTime="555.422">
            <label>Mr. Raymond D. Battocchi</label>
            <text syncTime="529.717" offset="2258458">Well, if I can take the first part first, Mr. Chief Justice, this statute does proscribe an acceptable and an unacceptable point of view: if someone stands in front of any embassy with a message designed to disagree with the acts or policies of a foreign government, that is proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.669" offset="2330243">Of course, the proscription depends in part on a policeman's judgment as to what is designed to criticize a government and what is not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="555.422" stopTime="561.567">
            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="555.422" offset="2361276">But it is not enforcing a governmental point of view on anyone, not on the United States' governmental point of view on anyone.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="raymond_d_battocchi" startTime="561.567" stopTime="646.194">
            <label>Mr. Raymond D. Battocchi</label>
            <text syncTime="561.567" offset="2385831">The United States' governmental point of view mandated by Congress, is that views critical of foreign governments are illegal, but views supportive of foreign governments are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.235" offset="2428463">That "governmental view" is embodied in the first clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.898" offset="2447167">As construed by the court of appeals, someone could stand in front of the Nicaraguan Embassy and hold up a sign saying, "We support Daniel Ortega".</text>
            <text syncTime="587.196" offset="2488336">But if one word is changed on the sign, and the message is,</text>
            <text syncTime="590.298" offset="2500770">"We oppose Daniel Ortega and we oppose the Contras. "</text>
            <text syncTime="592.798" offset="2510801">that is then proscribed and it becomes a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.251" offset="2524594">So in our view, the statute is viewpoint-discriminatory in a very specific sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.793" offset="2550716">In some cases the Court has indicated that mere "content-based laws": as I understand that term it means that a... proscription of speech on all subjects except religion, for example, or all subjects except foreign affairs... a content-based distinction is, if not a per-se violation of the First Amendment, one that raises serious constitutional questions and requires a compelling governmental interest in order to be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.864" offset="2670984">In this case we have a narrow proscription: this statute does not prohibit all speech... it does not prohibit speech only on the subject of foreign affairs; it in fact singles out particular points of views.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="646.194" stopTime="668.398">
            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="646.194" offset="2724378">But it does not prohibit speech anywhere else in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.975" offset="2739425">On Conn... con or pro on these things; it simply prohibits a particular kind of speech in a very narrow place right in front of a foreign mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.812" offset="2778817">You can go anywhere else in the District of Columbia and say anything you want about the Nick... Nick... Nicaraguan government pro or con, or about the Russian government.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.870" offset="2819046">The statute applies within the 500-foot zones.</text>

            <text syncTime="1088.121" offset="4492032">But also, just from a legal standpoint, in the "equal protection" context, the government's answer to our argument essentially is that the insult-free interest is one of great constitutional magnitude, a paramount value in our constitutional scheme, and in response to that, it is relevant for us to point out that the Record belies that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.796" offset="4582729">If this interest is as paramount as the government contends, then how can it be that at the one place in the City of Washington, where there has been a great deal of exposure and where our activities are more visible to the world at-large than any place else, at the South African Embassy, they have let everybody violate the statute and get away with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.099" offset="4663918">That certainly is relevant to whether the asserted compelling nature of this interest is in fact as important as the government suggests or whether the Record belies that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.138" offset="4708117">If I may, I would like to turn to the grounds upon which the government attempts to defend the first clause: the first interest asserted is the "dignity interest".</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.777" offset="4770706">As we understand the government's position, there is no dispute that this clause cannot be sustained as a reasonable or valid time, place or matter restriction because it is content-based and therefore, by definition, not a valid time, place or matter restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.988" offset="4835490">The government's position is that the first clause serves to further a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to accomplish that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.115" offset="4872061">The compelling interest is the so-called "dignity interest".</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.745" offset="4886585">Again, the "dignity interest" asserted by the government is not an interest in the context of speech or the style of expression; it is not the difference between speaking through a loudspeaker system and conveying messages in a more delicate way... the interest is an interest in avoiding political disagreements or political insults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.051" offset="4983761">In our view, the simplistic view we take of this issue, the argument that the avoidance of political insults is a compelling governmental interest which can override First Amendment rights, is a contradiction in terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.143" offset="5048127">Insofar as we can tell, even though the Article II makes the President and Commander in Chief, it is clear in the Court's prior decisions that members of the public have a right to politically criticize the President for his conduct in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.173" offset="5116254">Ever since Bridges v. California through Linmark v.

            <text syncTime="1260.633" offset="5182083">As on the basis of what we understand about the adoption and gratification of the First Amendment, it seems difficult to believe that those who wrote and ratified the First Amendment intended to empower the Congress to enshroud political opponents like King George or other world leaders, in an envelope that immunizes them from criticism.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.681" offset="7542298">The restrictions on speech are modest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.303" offset="7556822">The only restriction on demonstrations is within the immediate vicinity of foreign embassies; that is, within 500 feet of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1887.925" offset="7691301">It had the strong support of the State Department: Secretary of State Hull requested that the statute be enacted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2714.395" offset="10997149">The Petitioners in this case lose sight of the fact that the target of the demonstrations in this case is not an organ of domestic government, as has been true in most of the cases that this Court has considered, such as the Edwards case and the Grace case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.115" offset="11060052">It concerns the diplomatic representatives of a foreign government and a foreign mission in the seat of government in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.210" offset="11092443">And the function of a diplomatic mission such as that is not to either participate in or to be the staging ground for domestic political disputes or controversies within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.727" offset="11134448">It has a quite distinct function of carrying on that country's diplomatic mission with the United States Government, and as a matter of practice, and as a matter of obligation under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, those dealings with the United States are to be carried on directly with the United States Government and the foreign embassy has an obligation to remain removed from the internal affairs of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.095" offset="11239983">These considerations set a diplomatic mission in the District of Columbia apart from the domestic political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.820" offset="11270807">In our view, that unique status of diplomatic missions under the Constitution and under the First Amendment means that Congress may interpose what is here a modest geographical separation between the diplomatic representative of a foreign government and persons in the United States who seek to demonstrate against the position of the foreign government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.116" offset="11364012">Or, as Senator Pittman, the principal sponsor in 1938 put it,</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.228" offset="11380522">"all the statute seeks to do is to protect the representatives and the mission from having criticism of their government brought to their attention right in their faces. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.304" offset="14096734">The Court's Decision last term in Houston v. Hill is the latest example of a case where the Court was concerned about testing that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.419" offset="14125260">This statute, 22-1115 has as a virtue of establishing a clear rule that both the Secret Service can work and respect that diplomatic personnel know that they are secure within that 500 foot perimeter, and demonstrators know precisely where the borderline is in terms of what they can do and what they cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.654" offset="14210210">And this statute has been on the books for 50 years and has operated with that 500 foot buffer zone around U.S. Embassies in the United States, and it has operated efficiently, and nothing in this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence requires that that congressional judgment be overturned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3549.715" offset="14338419">In fact, Cox rests on a number of the same considerations that underlay 22-1115, which is the importance in that case to protect the judicial function; in this case to protect the diplomatic function, from both real and apparent political pressures, and to allow it to function freely without the outside interference that might be more appropriately be directed at the political branches of the United States Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3595.834" offset="14522948">This is a statute that is not justified on the content, but is instead justified on the content neutral consequences that would flow from the sorts of demonstrations that the statute is directed to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3613.346" offset="14592956">Well, Congress certainly has oversight responsibilities over the District police.</text>

            <text syncTime="3644.107" offset="14715941">Mr. Chief Justice, if I have not made this clear, I would like to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.778" offset="14734644">The Vienna Convention of 1961 is the only treaty that is implicated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.093" offset="14759931">That is the document that prescribes the international obligation to protect foreign missions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.975" offset="14779470">The Congress implemented that treaty in 1972 through 18 U.S.C. 112, which is the nationwide federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.111" offset="14816042">That statute prohibits conduct, but does not prohibit speech, at least by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.566" offset="14841851">Congress, in passing a nationwide federal statute, has concluded that the First Amendment does not allow it to proscribe speech that is insulting to foreigners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.965" offset="14891379">As one final point, the District of Columbia has a police line regulation which was upheld in the Cullinane case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.680" offset="14926278">It allows the police to remove people from areas, to set up a police line to keep them out of areas when they reasonably that is necessary to protect persons and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.818" offset="14974866">That police line regulation would remain standing even if the second clause is stricken and would give the District of Columbia police all the authority they legitimately need to protect the persons and property of any foreign governments or forcing officials.</text>
