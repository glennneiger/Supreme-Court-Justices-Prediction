            <text syncTime="54.593" offset="321734">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.420" offset="333124">This case concerns the location of Mississippi's coastline and the extent of its seaward boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.000" offset="355380">During the course of my argument, I will be referring to charts which were included in the amicus brief of the State of Alaska, as well as figure number two included in the report of the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.853" offset="414835">Now, in the previous proceeding before this Court, we were all focusing on the question of whether Mississippi Sound constituted inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.040" offset="443569">We presented our case and this Court agreed that it was inland waters and directed the Master to frame an appropriate decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.878" offset="474916">And approaching that task, the Master was faced with a problem as he approached the western end of Mississippi Sound, the area where Mississippi Sound meets the waters of Chandeleur Sound South.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.936" offset="531132">Obvious solution to the problem was that a corner had to be drawn somewhere closing both of these areas of inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.881" offset="566972">The Master, however, felt constrained not to deal with an issue which appeared to be obvious in light of the Court's previous opinion that is necessary and obvious for establishing a coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.228" offset="620366">Now, the Solicitor General's argument is confusing as to whether or not he is suggesting remand or at this case, as at an end and that no further proceeding should be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.444" offset="665192">He says this is a case about Mississippi Sound only and that it should be reserved for a supplemental decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.710" offset="694240">What we're asking the Court to do today is to remand this case with instructions to the Master so that he can deal with the coastline question in a logical manner and not feel foreclosed from recommending a proper decree in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.036" offset="751501">That's the Solicitor General's position too and we all agreed on remand and there's no issue for this Court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.843" offset="782743">However, if the Government is arguing that the case is over, we contend that they are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.711" offset="810224">Mississippi Sound or Chandeleur Sound of the South or inland waters or at least this Court (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <text syncTime="201.915" offset="911057">In fact, in the last proceeding, the Court held that Mississippi Sound was in fact inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.860" offset="934880">The two Sounds are at right angles to each other and are separated from one another by Cat Island, West Ship Island, and East Ship Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.923" offset="975109">And I think it's very important to note that Ship Island in the past has been a single island.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.886" offset="1590972">I think in that regard, it's interesting to look at what the parties were claiming and specifically, what the Court said about Chandeleur Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.755" offset="1626394">In that case, of course, the State of Louisiana asked for a decree defining its boundary line as the deep water channel.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.154" offset="1748020">Now, very clearly, the Court was under the impression in that length or at least Louisiana was under the impression that the Gulf of Mexico began eastward of the Chandeleur Islands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.607" offset="6717868">This appears at page 3 of the motion, paragraph 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.804" offset="6734586">That statement defined what this case was all about and if that wasn't not enough, there are number of other statements that Mississippi has made along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.490" offset="6765411">In the motion supporting or the memorandum supporting that motion at page 29, they said, “Therefore, we submit that the barrier islands enclosing the Mississippi Sound represents the outer limit of inland waters for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act and Mississippi is entitled to have this Court designate its coastline is extending from the line of ordinary low watermark on the seaward side of such islands, a distance of three geographic miles into the Gulf of Mexico.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2654.016" offset="10719514">So far as the lateral boundary with Louisiana, I might point out that boundary has not been fixed or established beyond the point at which this Court's decree ended in 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.330" offset="10768728">So, there is a question as to the fact of where that would be located.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.923" offset="10787119">With respect to how long it would take this case, Mr. Minear notes that it -- he would expect five years, I think that would very a lengthy period of time in view of the documentation and review of the case authorities which we have to support a case before the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.514" offset="10849499">Once the case was presented after some preliminary negotiations, it took approximately 10 months to get the case ready for submission to the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.450" offset="10893176">And I think on a remand that we could probably wrap this case up in a year's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.170" offset="10912088">I do not anticipate it would take longer than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.026" offset="10923478">The Master is intimately familiar with the geography of the area that has been involved in this sort of cases or Mr. Minear's says 20 years, he has written reports before and I think that he could very well handle this matter without unnecessary delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.263" offset="10996412">I think if we have a new Master, the new Master would have the problem of having to become familiar, perhaps a whole new area of law which he might not have been familiar with before.</text>
