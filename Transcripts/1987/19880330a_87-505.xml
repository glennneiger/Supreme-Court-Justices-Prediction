            <text syncTime="14.472" offset="200484">At the outset I would like to try to articulate what I think is the crucial issue here, and that is where simply stated a federal court has dismissed a case on grounds of forum non conveniens and the Plaintiffs refiled in the state court; whether or not that federal court can then enjoin the state court despite the provisions of the anti-injunction statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="42.829" offset="313856">Now having said that, I'd like to go into a little detail about the procedural facts involved here, because I think they're important.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.106" offset="350950">And particularly important for what was not decided in the original federal court action in the light of this Court's decision in Atlantic Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.401" offset="384177">After the case was dismissed on grounds of forum non conveniens by the initial federal court and suit was filed in the state court, the Respondents removed to the federal court; the federal court, though, requested to do so by the Petitioners, to remand the case; and refused to remand; and again dismissed the case; and that was appealed; and the Fifth Circuit reversed that decision and ordered that the case be remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.861" offset="506013">Once the case was remanded to the state court, the respondents then went to the federal court in a new suit and got the permanent injunction, which is the basis of this hearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.028" offset="558675">Now, in the mean time, that went up on appeal to the Fifth Circuit; and while that was being done, there was another case proceeding out on the West Coast in the Ninth Circuit, called the Zipfel case, and the Fifth Circuit in this case, in a split decision held, that the injunction was proper under the relitigation exception, apparently... that's the way I read the decision... because even though there was a difference between the Texas forum non conveniens law and the federal forum non conveniens law, the federal forum non conveniens doctrine pre-empted the state doctrine; and therefore, there was the basis for entering... issuing, the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.999" offset="746548">Judge Reavley dissented and held that on the basis of Atlantic Coast Line and other Supreme Court decisions that that was not a proper decision, and those matters should be left to the state courts to decide; and that the injunction was not proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.748" offset="797539">His dissent agreed almost foursquare with the unanimous decision of the Ninth Circuit in the Zipfel case which held that in a similar situation... also a maritime case, the injunction was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.078" offset="850829">Having said that, I'd like to as I said a moment ago, to point out what was not decided in the original federal court action: it was not decided that, as contended by... the Respondents and some of the amici briefs, that the case could not be tried anywhere in the United States; nor was it decided that it had to be tried in Singapore.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.133" offset="951035">What was simply decided was that federal court would not accept a case on grounds of forum non conveniens; that that federal court did not feel that it was a convenient forum for the case; and imposed conditions so that, if the Plaintiffs wanted to, they could go to Singapore and have the case adjudicated there.</text>

            <text syncTime="721.652" offset="3029128">Because it's a decision on the grounds of forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.975" offset="3042398">They dismissed the state law claims and all other claims other than the federal maritime law claims on the forum non conveniens, Your Honor, without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.542" offset="3076670">The Order says "without prejudice".</text>
            <text syncTime="735.112" offset="3083044">So it cannot be a decision on the merits as I see it; and certainly it's not the basis of an injunction under 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.787" offset="3113660">It does not constitute that kind of an order that can be subject to a relitigation exception injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.420" offset="3136230">At any event, what else was not decided in the case below was, and this is very important when we read Atlantic Coast Line, that the pre-emption question was not raised or decided in the federal court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.393" offset="3204148">Moreover, the state law forum non conveniens law, that is, what law would apply and what is a state law and how it would apply in this particular case, and whether or not the case would be appropriately dismissed on the grounds of forum non conveniens under state law was not raised or decided in the federal court action, the first original federal court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.385" offset="3284083">So that, when you read Atlantic Coast Line, the bottom line to all of it is, is that Atlantic Coast Line, as I respectfully read it, says, that unless issues are actually raised, cannot form the basis of the injunction on the basis of the relitigation section.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.576" offset="3352837">So these issues, not having been raise, as occurred in Atlantic Coast Line, the pre-emption question was not raised there; for the majority, the court held that the injunction was not proper; and the same thing would apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.264" offset="3407590">And I think Atlantic Coast Line in that regard is pretty well dispositive of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.997" offset="3422532">Even if pre-emption could be the basis, and I say that even if a pre-emption had been raised, I don't think pre-emption is the kind of thing when you read three decisions, that would be Vendo, Atlantic Coast Line, and Amalgamated Clothing Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.909" offset="3494212">All three of those cases speak very strongly about, and Chief Justice Rehnquist in his opinion in Vendo, said that whenever you have the question of pre-emption, or federal interest versus the Anti-Injunction statute, that federal interest pre-emption question must give way.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.720" offset="3565474">The Court will not sit and balance those matters; they'll leave it to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.215" offset="3583446">And therefore, as stated in Atlantic Coast Line, pre-emption is not one of the exceptions to the anti-injunction statute, so that I think the Respondents are misplaced in trying to contend, as was Judge Gee in the Fifth Circuit that, on the basis of pre-emption, an injunction can issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.170" offset="3751257">And that therefore an injunction can issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="914.429" offset="3800262">I think that Chief Judge Brown of the Fifth Circuit says pre-emption does not equal res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.912" offset="3818235">It's just... what I'm saying is they can't bootstrap themselves into a res judicata type of situation which would justify an injunction under the relitigation section using the doctrine of pre-emption.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.311" offset="3871838">And that's stated very foursquare by this Court on various occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.764" offset="3885630">So I'm saying that, even if they had raised the issue exemption, the issue of pre-emption being the focal point of how they try to justify this injunction, this injunction must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.951" offset="3938398">Now even if they had... if the pre-emption doctrine could be the basis of an injunction in other cases, and it could possibly have been in Atlantic Coast Line, it certainly could not be in a forum non conveniens case.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.254" offset="4007570">And there is a reason for this:</text>
            <text syncTime="968.777" offset="4017601">The main reason is that the test laid down for both the second and third exception to the Anti-Injunction statute, being in the second, in aid of jurisdiction; and the third being the relitigation exception, or to effectuate and preserve a judgment... is that the, in order for the injunction to be justified, the action in the state court must in some way interfere with the adjudication by the federal court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.818" offset="4149781">Must "impair", as I believe the term was used, "impair the adjudication" by the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.670" offset="4169216">It's hard for me to see how the state court action in this case could impair the federal court in adjudication of this matter when the federal court says we don't want to adjudicate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.865" offset="4209967">We refuse to adjudicate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.528" offset="4216654">We're dismissing it on grounds of forum non conveniens, and by using the test that was laid down, and I believe it was Chief Justice Rehnquist in the Vendo case said that test applies to both the second and third exception; and this was also discussed in Atlantic Coast Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.328" offset="4275900">That being the test, I don't see how any injunction could be justified in this case because there is nothing in the state court action now that the federal court has said we don't want to adjudicate this case; how it could be said that the state court action could in any way impair the right of the power of the federal court to adjudicate a case it doesn't want to adjudicate?</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.990" offset="4350506">So also, we believe that the doctrine itself, when you look at the Supreme Court cases, this Court's cases on forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.000" offset="4402541">And I'm speaking primarily of Missouri v. Mayfield and Parsons v. Chesapeake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.223" offset="4423439">Missouri v. Mayfield is a very important case, in my opinion; the Respondents try to downplay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.539" offset="4452697">And it was an FELA case, not a maritime case; and it was not a 2283 case, Anti-Injunction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.354" offset="4483939">But what this Court held in Missouri v. Mayfield was that a state court has the right to have a doctrine of forum non conveniens if it wants to; it has a right not to have a doctrine of forum non conveniens if it wants to... which may very well be the Texas situation under it's open forum statute; or it may have one and it's criteria may differ from the federal criteria.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.092" offset="4718937">The Supreme Court, in describing what a forum non conveniens determination is in Missouri v. Mayfield and Parsons v. Chesapeake, has indicated quite clearly that each court has a right to decide what that doctrine is and decide it itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.639" offset="4773062">Now, all the cases I have read on the maritime pre-emption, Your Honor, have dealt with substantive rights, and Justice O'Connor has made that statement at least about four or five times in that opinion in Talentire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.898" offset="4822173">And it seems to me that what this Court held in Talentire was that the savings to suitor clause is reserved to the state court's right the right to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.546" offset="4864700">The right to the jurisdiction; the concurrent jurisdiction of handling maritime cases and admiralty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.179" offset="4887270">And if you were to agree with the Respondents in this case, the savings to suitor clause would be wholly nullified, because Talentire said that the law, the law of the state, the substantive law of the state, must give way to the substantive law of the federal maritime law, and I can understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.104" offset="4970966">But there's nothing in Talentire and there's nothing in any of the uniformity and pre-emption cases that indicates that a procedural doctrine like forum non conveniens can be th subject of pre-emption or reverse-Erie or uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.031" offset="5026659">So particularly is that true when you look at how the Supreme Court has described that doctrine in Missouri v. Mayfield and Parsons v. Chesapeake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.666" offset="5057170">So that my answer is, that I believe that it does not pre-empt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.470" offset="5080471">But I go back to my point, Mr. Chief Justice, that even if it did not pre-empt, it cannot be the subject of an injunction under 2283.</text>
