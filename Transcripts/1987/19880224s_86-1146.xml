            <text syncTime="9.204" offset="117696">This case is here from the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.350" offset="138281">The respondent applied for supplemental security income benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.530" offset="179032">The Secretary of Health and Human Services denied the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.458" offset="202647">Respondent then appealed to the District Court which reversed the denial and awarded respondent to the past-due benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.310" offset="238069">And the court also ordered the Secretary to pay attorney's fees to respondent's attorney out of the past-due benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.312" offset="278088">And the question for decision on this case is whether the Court has the authority to make of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.042" offset="312988">The Court of Appeals held that it did and affirmed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.655" offset="339528">We reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.215" offset="345693">We hold that the District Court does not have the authority to order the Secretary to withhold a portion of past-due SSI benefits for the payment of attorney's fees received in judicial proceedings under Title XVI.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.216" offset="409745">The opinion is unanimous except that Justice Kennedy took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
