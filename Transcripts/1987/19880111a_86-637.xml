            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="131068">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 86-637, Communication Workers of America versus Harry E. Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.356" offset="168475">Mr. Gold, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence E. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="12.558" offset="181223">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.997" offset="223019">The Communication Workers of America, the petitioners in this case, are the exclusive bargaining representative of a group of employees who work for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company as it then was when this case began, and various of its subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.445" offset="312776">The plaintiffs in this case, the respondents here, are a group of individuals who work for a Bell Telephone Company in an organized bargaining unit which is covered by a Union Security provision, namely a provision requiring that an amount equal to the dues charged by the Union to its members are paid by all employees in the bargaining unit thirty days after they become employed, as a condition of continued employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.106" offset="479437">This case began when a group of twenty employees sued to invalidate that requirement and to limit the requirement to an amount equal to what the Union pays for what can be defined in various ways but can be said to be for activities germane to collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.291" offset="600227">The District Court on constitutional grounds and eventually an en banc Court of Appeals by a vote of six of the Judges on different grounds held that the plaintiffs had stated a valid Federal cause of action, and that the relief prayed for should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.132" offset="739512">The Second Circuit concluded to the opposite effect, holding that all of the Federal claims made by the plaintiffs, one of which is based on Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, another which is based on the duty of fair representation, and the final one of which is based on the First Amendment to the Constitution, are without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.168" offset="863646">The case is here on our petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.638" offset="885589">The National Labor Relations Act treats with the question presented here in terms, and I'd like to begin by directing the Court to the language of Section 8(a)(3) which is set out as an appendix to our brief on the merits, the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.955" offset="986839">Section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA prohibits in general terms discrimination on the basis of union membership and union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.745" offset="1029994">Section 8(a)(3) then has two provisos, the first of which in essence was in the law in 1935, and the second of which was added in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.570" offset="1085269">The first proviso says in effect that nothing in this subchapter or in any other statute of the United States shall preclude the type of union security agreement at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.983" offset="1162905">And the second proviso in its second clause, the one labeled (b), which is on page 2-a of the Appendix, says that no employer may under these provisos discharge any individual if he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership in the union was denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="303.863" offset="1346493">The second proviso is then a proviso to the first proviso, so to speak?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence E. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="307.917" offset="1362689">I think both provisos are provisos to the basic prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.738" offset="1385990">I think the two provisos are intended to be read and have been read together, each one of the conditions stated in the two provisos have to be satisfied for the clause to be lawful and to impose the requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.984" offset="1470941">And as this Court has concluded in both the Schermerhorn and the General Motors cases, what the provisos under the NLRA taken together mean, at the very least... and we're going to find out in this case whether they mean more... but what they mean at the very least is that an individual who says I am willing to pay the initiation fee charged by the Union which is the exclusive representative, and I am willing to pay the periodic dues uniformly charged to members, cannot be dismissed from employment by the employer without violating Section 8(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="379.430" offset="1648782">So in terms of the plain language of Section 8(a)(3), it seems to us as we have argued throughout and as the Second Circuit held, that this case is an open and shut case.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.075" offset="1723284">Congress did not say simply that individuals covered by a collective bargaining agreement of this kind would be required to pay undefined dues leaving an ambiguity as the respondents claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.620" offset="1801546">Rather the statute imposes a clear requirement, namely, that to be lawful, these agreements can go no further than the dues and initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="446.139" offset="1915545">Mr. Gold, is there no ambiguity there?</text>
            <text syncTime="448.089" offset="1923381">Would you say that any charge is made for initiation is an initiation fee and any amount required as dues, no matter what it is devoted to, would come within this provision?</text>
            <text syncTime="462.581" offset="1981373">I mean, suppose a union decides that it's going to provide retirement benefits for its membership, and it's going to fund these not out of payments from their paychecks, but it's going to fund it out of union dues, and this retirement is only given to union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.527" offset="2053158">Now, can the union do that and charge very very high dues but the union members are willing to pay it because they can get retirement?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence E. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="486.966" offset="2078862">First of all on initiation fees, Congress did decide to regulate the amounts in part for the type of concern that you've stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.392" offset="2140616">Secondly, with regard to dues, in 1947, the House proposed to regulate dues to assure that they were reasonable, they weren't too high, they were used for purposes that are called proper under the circumstances, and the Senate refused, saying there should not be such regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.673" offset="2237687">It seems to us that putting aside the illumination one gets from the evolution, that when you talk about the amount uniformly required to maintain your good standing membership in the organization, it's the amount uniformly required without regard to how it is thereafter used.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.456" offset="2336848">That is the amount that each person who is a member and chooses to continue to be a member is charged.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="560.478" offset="2372897">But if that's what Congress intended, it could simply have said, instead of the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required, it could have simply said the failure of the employee to tender any amount of money uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.475" offset="2456906">Congress had to use the words, dues and fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.591" offset="2465370">For a good reason, and certainly would have preferred the language you just articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.199" offset="2503822">Congress took away from unions, not only the closed shop, but also took away from unions the ability to charge as a condition of continued employment those who didn't want to be voluntary members assessments and fines and non-periodic payments of those kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.433" offset="2616776">Of course they would have been uniform.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.118" offset="2631509">If everybody, in other words, it is normal and the language of the Railway Labor Act to which we will get in a minute is different in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.924" offset="2666722">It is normal for unions to charge assessments in addition to dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.347" offset="2692426">For example, some unions have a practice of charging each member two dollars a month to be a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.953" offset="2730879">In addition, there is a once yearly charge of three dollars which is payable only once a year to fund a convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.927" offset="2774764">In the language of the trade, that's an assessment, and assessments are uniform, but they are not periodic in the sense that the Statute has been understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.603" offset="2837458">And therefore, an individual in a position of the objecting payors in this case cannot under the NLRA be required to pay the assessment.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="689.745" offset="2890017">But if you eliminated that and put it in the dues, it would be okay, which the union could do, I presume?</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="694.881" offset="2910497">We're not going to have any more assessments, we're just going to raise the dues three dollars a year.</text>

          <turn speaker="laurence_e_gold" startTime="698.266" stopTime="735.476">
            <label>Mr. Laurence E. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="698.266" offset="2924080">If the union can, and the Landrom-Griffin Act provides that you have to get membership approval, as opposed to the situation of public bodies where the representative can act, provide that where the union goes to its members and says we want x dues and makes the case to them, and then each month or each quarter someone has to pay that, that is dues.</text>

            <text syncTime="763.559" offset="3185200">In terms of the understanding of the time, let me also point out that at the very time Congress was dealing with this question, it passed what is the precursor of the present Federal Election Campaign Act, which applies to unions and corporations, and prohibited unions from using any portion of their dues or initiation fees or assessments for the purpose of making political expenditures and contributions in Federal elections as those terms are defined in those Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.053" offset="3347264">So Congress understood quite well that unions use dues for a variety of purposes, and have traditionally funded their activities from dues.</text>

            <text syncTime="849.732" offset="3529912">I had hoped we had dealt with it more, but let me go back to the language of the first proviso of 8(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="861.307" offset="3576201">The proviso says that nothing in this subchapter or in any other statute of the United States shall invalidate the kinds of agreements that are permitted under this section.</text>

            <text syncTime="877.733" offset="3641925">That the duty of fair representation as implied from Section 9(a) and from the NLRA as a whole, to read the duty to invalidate that which Congress chose after the most careful consideration and heated debate not to invalidate would be contrary to all the theories of statutory interpretation and of elaborating the meaning and purpose of the statute of which we are aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.388" offset="3776612">We do not believe that you can take the duty of fair representation and say that union activity, which Congress decided expressly to permit, is invidious or improper under a judge-made rule using the general terms of the duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.271" offset="3876087">The duty it seems to us has its metes and bounds delineated by that which Congress specifically decided in this statute to permit as a matter of Federal law, while not prohibiting the States, I would add, from reaching a contrary conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.971" offset="3970859">At the time of the 1947 Act, twelve States made it unlawful to have any form of union security, and at the present time, the number is 20.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.148" offset="4135639">This is an issue which has been visited from the Hanson case on through the Hudson case most recently, both under the Railway Labor Act, and under the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.973" offset="4194885">It seems to us that with regard to the NLRA, there are two critical differences that explain why this case is to be decided differently from the RLA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.150" offset="4259564">First of all, as we develop at length in our brief, the starting point for legislative consideration was at the exact opposite ends of the spectrum in this Act, and in the RLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.028" offset="4327169">In this Act, Congress approached the problem against a background where, as I say, except for twelve States in 1947, all forms of union security including the closed shop which required that an individual in order to get a job in the first place be a full member of the labor organization which had negotiated the agreement were lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.298" offset="4440227">And there were many who believed that the Federal law should not invalidate even the closed shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.903" offset="4482650">It was the view of the majority in Congress at that time who were operating against the fact that the President of the United States did not agree with then and had vetoed legislation in '46, and had said he would veto it again, that union security should be regulated to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.804" offset="4586199">And as I said, and if you'll look at the Senate report, the section dealing with union security begins with a phrase to the effect that this is a most contentious issue to which we've given the most mature consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.348" offset="4656417">And the conclusion of the sponsors and leaders of the Republican party in the Congress was that the closed shop should be invalidated and that the union shop which provided for dues should continue to be permitted as a matter of Federal law, but not required as a matter of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.083" offset="4763310">And should continue to be subject to regulation by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.070" offset="4787342">And I would like in particular we lay out a good deal of the legislative history but in terms of the sense of what that Congress believed was fair and proper under the circumstances, taking all the realities into account, I think that Senator Taft's statement, which we reproduced on page 33 of our brief, is a particularly succinct summary of the feeling at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.808" offset="4918268">He said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.243" offset="4924015">"the great difference between the closed shop and the union shop is that under the union shop in the first instance, a man can get a job without joining the union or asking favors of the union. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.384" offset="4972603">"The fact that the employee will have to pay dues to the union seems to me to be much less important. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.871" offset="4998516">"The important thing is that the man will have the job. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.906" offset="5010637">Now, different people can reach different conclusions about whether that went far enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.928" offset="5046686">But that was the view at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.228" offset="5051910">The closed shop which gave the union authority over jobs was to be ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.763" offset="5074062">The union shop which had always required an equality of sacrifice, financial sacrifice by all in the shop ought to be continued.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.373" offset="5132472">Supposing that a District Judge held in this hypothetical example that the amount the excess part of the dues that was used to fund pensions for union members only should not really be considered dues within the meaning of the statute, and therefore enjoined collection of the excess.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.084" offset="5199346">Would you say that such a holding was tantamount to holding the union shop unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.356" offset="5436433">But I do believe that the task of statutory construction, in Judge Learned Hand's phrase, is to recreate the gamut of values at the time and the gamut of values at the time was to preserve that which had been in existence up through 1947, which did not permit that kind of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1498.116" offset="6123453">In 1951, when Congress amended the Railway Labor Act to put in similar language, the situation was that as a matter of Federal law, all forms of union security were unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.305" offset="6168279">And Congress again made a compromise, but it was moving from the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.726" offset="6189909">And this Court was convinced from the history of the RLA that it was fairly possible to read the RLA as only permitting the collection of an amount of money equal to the amount expended for collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.074" offset="6279352">Even more important in our view, in the RLA this Court had determined in the Hanson case that since Federal law preempted all State law which would limit union security and had created a Federal scheme that each union security provision was imbued with Federal law and was the action of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.878" offset="6410487">Under this Court's decisions, the most recent of which is San Francisco Arts and Athletics all you have here is a governmental permission, a permission no different than the permission given to the Olympic Committee there or permission of the kind at issue in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison to in private parties unions and employers to reach these kinds of agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.349" offset="6540368">Thus, this is not a case in which there is any substantial constitutional issue, and that being so and given the language and the legislative history of 8(a)(3), both parts of the language of 8(a)(3), the second proviso which we've discussed, and the proviso saying notwithstanding any other law, we believe that this agreement which requires each individual in the bargaining unit to pay the same amount is indisputably lawful as a matter of Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.595" offset="6725419">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.116" offset="6739525">The argument we've just heard from Mr. Gold is very interesting as a matter of policy considerations, but I believe it's somewhat anachronistic as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.103" offset="6771395">As Mr. Gold himself said, we are not writing on a clean slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.072" offset="6783306">We are not back in 1947 or 1948, interpreting Section 8(a)(3) as if we've never heard anything about it before from the Courts or even from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.530" offset="6821132">Forty years have passed, a number of decisions have been rendered by this Court and there was an amendment of the Railway Labor Act in 1951 to give us an equivalent provision in Section 211.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.087" offset="6871391">And all of this material I believe, and we have argued, tends rather strongly, if not compellingly, to put to one side the policy judgments that Mr. Gold is urging, and to come to something of a different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.847" offset="6926353">Now, if you'll look at the statute, Mr. Gold says, well, the plain language makes it an open and shut case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.149" offset="6947564">Of course, according to his theory, the plain language of the statute would allow full-fledged membership in a labor organization to be required by an employer and a labor organization under Section 8(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.588" offset="6993331">Well, very early on in the history of Taft-Hartley Act interpretation, this Court in Radio Officers Union case in the early 50s, the Court said in fact that wasn't the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.145" offset="7031574">The purpose of putting in the amendments to 8(a)(3) was not to allow the type of full fledged membership control that I think would be required by Mr. Gold's interpretation, but to force employees to pay a monetary sum to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.738" offset="7097925">Monetary sum for what purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.107" offset="7111404">I get back then to the question of dues and fees, the purpose of dues and fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.428" offset="7132720">Obviously, we can't interpret this statute in the hyper-literalistic way that Mr. Gold suggests, because the Court hasn't interpreted the statute that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.700" offset="7169814">The language of 8(a)(3) talks about dues and fees uniformly required as a condition of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.187" offset="7195728">What kind of membership are we talking about here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.806" offset="7206281">Pattern Makers' case, a couple of years ago, this Court referred to voluntary unionism as the thrust of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.078" offset="7247346">An employee could not be required to become a full-fledged member of the union and he could resign if he had become a member of the union voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.350" offset="7280364">He could not be forced into membership through an 8(a)(3) agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.469" offset="7292903">What can an employee be forced into with respect to a union with respect to an 8(a)(3)-type agreement?</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.956" offset="7318817">It is the status of accepting the union as the employees' exclusive representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.610" offset="7341491">An 8(a)(3) agreement can be negotiated only by a Section 9(a) labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.014" offset="7367091">What is a Section 9(a) labor organization?</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.216" offset="7379839">It is an organization that has been certified by the NLRB as the majority representative for the purpose of collective bargaining, grievance adjustment, and administration of collective bargaining agreements, and no other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.308" offset="7440234">That's what Section 9(a) says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.360" offset="7452459">And that's what Section 8(d) tells us about collective bargaining where it defines it rather specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.312" offset="7468237">So we're talking about what I would think, and certainly suggest, is a very tightly woven set of provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.251" offset="7500002">Collective bargaining and the majority representatives through 9(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.036" offset="7519124">Section 8(a)(3) agreements when a 9(a) labor organization has become the representative of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.058" offset="7555277">And decisions of this Court saying that the membership requirement so called is a requirement solely directed towards compulsory payment of dues and fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.449" offset="7596864">Now, this makes rather operationally good sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.235" offset="7611910">An employee who is not a union member and who cannot be required to be a union member lawfully nevertheless can be required to pay dues and fees to the labor organization that has been selected, ostensibly in this case by others because we're talking about a non-member, by others, to represent him for the purpose of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.999" offset="7691009">And from that seems to follow very nicely, at least as an equitable judgment, that the dues and fees should be limited to the costs that that union incurs in performing that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.420" offset="7732701">Now, once again, the statute sets up a mutual system of liabilities and rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.341" offset="7948368">And I think the Court said that if that death benefit program inured only to the benefit of union members, it couldn't be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.161" offset="7975639">So we had a situation there where unions, at least in that case it was the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, did in fact set up out of dues payments a similar type of benefit situation which it did not extend to the non-member.</text>

            <text syncTime="2030.055" offset="8251284">Well that's an interesting question as to what was required under Section 8(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.793" offset="8270196">We have rather a question begging interpretation from Mr. Gold, because I don't recall any decision of this Court, certainly, that ever held that 8(a)(3) would have validated the type of thing that CWA has required in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.469" offset="8328919">In fact, I recall in the Jones and Laughlin decision in 1937, that in fact, it was held that employers could continue to deal with individual employees, notwithstanding the existence of majority representative in the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.860" offset="8382418">So we probably have a situation that was quite a bit closer to common law under that Jones and Laughlin interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.514" offset="8401122">So I'm not so sure that we can simply take it for granted that 8(a)(3) would have been interpreted to allow at least what Mr. Gold is suggesting CWA is demanding in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.453" offset="8440828">In fact, if you took that position, you'd come rather rapidly to an interesting constitutional question, perhaps deeper and murkier than the one we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.141" offset="8471548">Let me address that for one moment, because Mr. Gold makes the argument that the interpretation of Section (2)(4) of the Railway Labor Act was somehow impelled by a constitutional consideration which he finds in pre-emption under Hanson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.151" offset="8535600">As I recall, Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion said that it was not merely a fairly plausible interpretation, but a quite reasonable interpretation of Section (2)(4) that limited dues, fees, and in that particular statute, assessments to the costs of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.863" offset="8602474">So if that interpretation was reasonable in the RLA context, I don't see why the same language is not capable of that interpretation in the National Labor Relations context, especially when you go back and look at the statements that were made by Senator Taft as well as others that they were attempting to do in the 1951 Amendment to the RLA, essentially the same thing they had done in the '47 Amendment, or at least put the Railway Labor Act unions in the same position, as the National Labor Relations Act unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.799" offset="8718248">And what was the burden of the testimony that had been given by the Rail Union leaders to Congress cited and quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.238" offset="8759940">In the Street opinion, it was we need these monies to pay the costs of the exclusive representational services that we are required by law to provide to the non-union member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.546" offset="8809155">And there's the balance in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.082" offset="8815319">The unions are required by law, once they obtain exclusive representational status, to provide certain benefits to non-union employees within those bargaining units.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.620" offset="8853458">What benefits are those?</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.389" offset="8860564">The benefits of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.405" offset="8868609">That's what they can't withhold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.507" offset="8872998">They don't have to provide political representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.626" offset="8881566">They don't have to provide social representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.859" offset="8890448">They don't have to provide union-only retirement funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.761" offset="8902046">They have to provide collective bargaining representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.280" offset="8916152">That the employee must accept, and he can demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.684" offset="8937781">And because he can demand it from the union, Congress believed it only fair that he could be required by the union to pay some commensurate cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="2265.257" offset="9192005">California was the source of the Ellis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.143" offset="9203604">I think on CWA's interpretation that pre-emption somehow has the controlling force over whether the statute should be interpreted to limit dues and fees to collective bargaining costs, one would seriously question whether the statute would have been interpreted that way in a California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.938" offset="9266820">I mean, why doesn't the statutory interpretation change under the Railway Labor Act depending on whether you're in a right to work or a non-right to work State?</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.425" offset="9296704">That brings us back to this Hanson point that Mr. Gold made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.460" offset="9308825">I don't think the statutory construction in Street depends upon the exclusive reading of Hanson that Hanson was a preemption case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.666" offset="9345710">Hanson talks about preemption because that was the argument raised by the Nebraska Supreme Court, the exclusive argument, I take it the Nebraska Supreme Court raised was they had to decide that case because there was Federal preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.242" offset="9399940">Hanson talks about Federal preemption and Mr. Justice Douglas goes on in his typically terse way and gives two or three other bases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3136.342" offset="12676426">And I'm saying that what happened in Street was a perfectly reasonable interpretation of the statute that fits what I think is the primary intention that you can read out of the structure of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.038" offset="13383195">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.290" offset="13388211">In terms of the parallel between these statutes, it seems to me is rational to say that because under the NLRA, you have the right to strike, that ought to be read into public sector law where it doesn't fit, or because you have the secondary boycott under the RLA without regard to what Congress did in 1947, NLRA unions ought to have the right to a secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.909" offset="13510673">The point of the matter is that these statutes are related to each other, but they're not identical to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.047" offset="13539199">Second, the reference that Mr. Vieira makes to Section 9(a), the fact that only a 9(a) union can make a union security agreement that's lawful under Federal law that isn't prohibited by Federal law again is a total red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.447" offset="13636792">That language was in the '35 Act at which time unions had the right to secure as a matter of Federal law, a closed shop, and you had to be a full member, you were subject, if you were discharged by the union for any arbitrary reason, could also be discharged from your employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.659" offset="13713697">And that's what Congress wanted to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.028" offset="13723101">Third, as Justice Marshall pointed out, it is not the law in this Court that everything an NLRA union does in negotiating a collective agreement is State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.038" offset="13791124">If it were, then Webber would have had to have been decided the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.143" offset="13819545">The fact of the matter is, unions, like public utilities, like the Olympic Committee, are a bundle of rights and powers, but insofar as the Government has no close nexus with the private decisionmaking, this State action cases make it absolutely plain that the union is a private party and that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.461" offset="13932812">--Well, on Street and Hanson, let me refer you back to the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.650" offset="13961651">In Hanson, at pages 231 and 232 of 351 U.S., the Court said, the Supreme Court of Nebraska took the view that justiciable questions under the First and Fifth Amendments were presented since Congress by the union shop provision sought to strike down inconsistent laws in 17 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.287" offset="14096129">The Supreme Court of Nebraska said such action on the part of Congress is a necessary part of every union shop contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.643" offset="14129566">We agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.843" offset="14134372">And then in Street, the portion of the opinion which introduces the constitutional element of the case is entitled "The Hanson Decision".</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.237" offset="14187976">So the difference between these two statutes, which we think is determinative with regard to whether you look at this through a constitutional lens is the preemption of State law in the Railway Labor Act, and the lack of preemption here.</text>
