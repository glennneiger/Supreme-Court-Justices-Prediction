            <text syncTime="14.358" offset="187502">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Prentiss Houston, a pro se inmate, gave his notice of appeal in a brief to prison authorities for mailing on February 3, 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.500" offset="240060">Those documents were stamp filed at the Clerk's Office some 81 miles away on February 7th, which happened to be 30 days and eight and one half hours after entry of the order denying his petition for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.327" offset="295440">Not until March 21st, when the Sixth Circuit entered an order directing Houston to show cause why his appeal should not be dismissed, did he learn of his untimeliness.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.116" offset="338594">After receiving his reasons for delay, and being directed to this Court's authority in Fallen v. United States, the Sixth Circuit appointed counsel, and directed counsel as one of the issues to be briefed to consider the applicability of Fallen to the case before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.977" offset="405990">Having been appointed by that court to brief the issue of jurisdiction, as well as the merits of the case, which were noted to be a first impression in the district, and having urged that court to allow Mr. Houston's appeal under Rule 4(a)(5), or under the precedent of Fallen v. United States, and having been told by that court summarily from the bench in open court that they were without jurisdiction, and that Fallen was of no help to the Petitioner, we apply to this Court for relief from that judgment of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals which we submit is plainly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.417" offset="547783">That judgment is plainly wrong for four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.102" offset="558545">Two of those reasons require reversal of the Sixth Circuit order, and a consideration by the Sixth Circuit on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.208" offset="590937">The other two issues, at the very least, require remand for consideration of Rule 4(a)(5), or for consideration of when Mr. Houston's notice was actually received.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.747" offset="637121">I will address the issues in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.883" offset="645585">First, turning to the precedent of Fallen v. United States, almost 25 years ago this Court recognized in the pro se Petitioner aspect that when a prisoner does all that he reasonably can do to affect a timely appeal, that his appeal should be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.595" offset="716429">In the words of this Court, the rules are not, and were not, intended to be a rigid code, to have an inflexible meaning irrespective of the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.354" offset="775466">Justice Rehnquist, that is correct, but, in fact, that proposition, that quote, in Fallen v. United States, was quoted by the Advisory Committee to the rules of appellate procedure, particularly under Rule 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.412" offset="827711">It was quoted in conjunction with four other cases, one of which was a civil case, and in conjunction with Coppedge v. United States, which in its footnote refers to either 2255 and 2254 petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.172" offset="886748">We suggest that what the Court focused on and found was not the nature of the case, but the nature of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.075" offset="918408">The state, in fact, urges you to distinguish Fallen based on the fact that it was a criminal case, and a direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.931" offset="945784">As the Court has pointed out, that is a factual difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.233" offset="959055">It is a distinction that does not make a difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.607" offset="1008478">--Justice O'Connor, the state points out that 20 USC Sec. 2107 is a statute that says that in civil cases an appeal must be brought within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.047" offset="1050274">Quite frankly, the point I am about to address is not adequately pointed out in our brief, and I think it is of significant importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.818" offset="1077337">The state relies on that statute for its argument that time limits are jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.854" offset="1097504">That statute says that an appeal must be filed within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.924" offset="1121745">As this Court recognized in Shack v. United States, when we were dealing with court rules, and not statutes, court rules aren't jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.280" offset="1155182">The meaning of the word file does not come from a promulgation of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.601" offset="1176498">It comes from Rule 25 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.922" offset="1193739">In fact, Rule 25 says that papers must be filed by receipt, but briefs may be filed by mailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.210" offset="1230937">It is a cruel irony in this case that Mr. Houston mailed a notice of appeal and a brief on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.531" offset="1264165">His brief, I suggest to you, was filed the day he mailed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.668" offset="1280779">His notice of appeal under Rule 25 was filed the day the Clerk stamped it as received.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.072" offset="1306379">It is also a cruel irony that had Mr. Houston been petitioning this Court for certiorari mailing, would have been filing.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.101" offset="1478473">The point is that Mr. Houston filed a brief, which conforms with the rules of appellate procedure requirement of what a notice of appeal is.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.207" offset="1518911">His brief on the cover said he was appealing from the United States District Court to the United States District Court of Appeals, which in his pro se language was what the court was.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.597" offset="1560498">It also stated the names of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.114" offset="1570529">That brief was filed the day it was mailed; however, his notice of appeal which accompanied it, which was filed the day it was received, was not received until eight and a half hours too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.322" offset="1615355">As this court recognized in Fallen, when a pro se inmate does all that he reasonably can do under the circumstances, perhaps mailing should be filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.778" offset="1649210">At least two members of this Court, Justice Brennan and Blackmun, recognize that in those situations prison authority should be the Clerk, because look at the situation we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.903" offset="1693722">Mr. Houston has to rely on his adversary to note his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.621" offset="1712530">Once he goes to prison authorities and hands over that appeal, there is absolutely nothing else he can do to make sure it gets there.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.541" offset="2064243">But there are numerous cases, even where attorneys wait too late to mail, that the Court said that reasonable reliance on the mail is sufficient to allow an untimely appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="689.557" offset="2888354">Those cases recognize that when a litigant, and may I suggest that in all three of those cases we were dealing with a litigant represented by a lawyer, when a litigant detrimentally relies on some action of the District Court, and doesn't timely note his appeal, then his appeal should be deemed timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.102" offset="2954496">In this case what happened between the day Mr. Houston presented his notice for mailing, and March 21st, is that Mr. Houston received a certificate of probable cause from the District Judge; he received a briefing schedule from the Court of Appeals; and he received a correspondence that required him to designate parts of his record.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.349" offset="3035476">He did all of that, thinking, as a pro se inmate would, that things were proceeding normally with the appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="766.891" offset="3197644">In that case the appellant's attorney was out vacationing, and the lawyer asked the District Judge to allow him to file his appeal late after the attorney returned from vacation, and the Judge said,</text>
            <text syncTime="779.900" offset="3249680">"yes, you may file a late appeal. "</text>
            <text syncTime="781.400" offset="3255636">In that case the Judge did say something in order to make those parties detrimentally rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.137" offset="3278624">However, in the case of Thompson and Wolfsohn, what happened particularly in Thompson is that the litigant filed a tolling motion, a Rule 52 or Rule 59 motion, too late, and the Judge heard the motion, and the other party, the Government, did not raise the lateness, and so then when the appeal was perfected the Court of Appeals threw it out and said your first motion didn't toll because it was two days beyond the ten day limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.573" offset="3388338">So in that case certainly the District Judge did not extend the appeal time.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.875" offset="3409549">In fact, the lawyers detrimentally relied on their own ignorance, yet this Court said in those circumstances it would be unfair to deny them an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.381" offset="3439642">Certainly I would agree that a lawyer who received a certificate of probable cause or a briefing schedule, would not detrimentally rely upon that, but we are dealing with an unskilled inmate, a person who this Court has called an unlettered prisoner without friends or funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1191.626" offset="4896544">In 1979 the rules were amended, and the rules were amended for three reasons, none of which deal with this act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1970.544" offset="8012220">I think the problems that are inherent in a rule... in a rule that construes late filed notice of appeal within the extension period as being a motion for an extension are, first, it runs contrary to the plain language of the rule, which requires that a motion be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.638" offset="8084632">I think another point to be made on that, and this does not necessarily make the conclusion that we reach correct, but I think it is very instructive, and that is that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that have considered this argument have rejected this argument, including the Fourth Circuit, which has rejected this argument sitting on bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.469" offset="8155998">I think those two factors taken together certainly indicate that in amending Rule 4(a)(5) to provide that in all instances a motion must be filed in order to obtain an extension, and that informal grants of extension of time would not be favored, mitigate against counsel's argument that a Rule 4(a)(5) extension can be granted when there is a late filed notice of appeal within the extension period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.142" offset="8298627">I think it is noteworthy here too that the extension period for criminal appeals in 4(b) may be extended with or without notice, and with or without a motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.783" offset="8345229">So that stands in stark contrast to the requirement for civil litigants that a motion must be filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.280" offset="11119224">In the words of... to paraphrase Mr. Justice Clark in his dissenting opinion, in Thompson v. The Internal Revenue Service, rules of appellate procedure are a necessary part of an orderly system of justice, but the courts must be willing to enforce those rules according to their terms if they are to have any efficacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.983" offset="11238029">The Court should not engage in ad hoc dispensations in particular facts, and in particular cases, because that would undermine the certainty of the rules, and only ultimately cause confusion amongst the Bench and Bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="2891.406" offset="11695695">Counsel faults Petitioner and his appointed counsel for not filing a Rule 60 motion in a situation when the Sixth Circuit in its order joint appendix 29 had assumed jurisdiction over the issue of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.268" offset="11763195">Counsel would have had counsel for the Petitioner go to another form while the Sixth Circuit had before it the issue of jurisdiction in order to file Rule 60?</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.575" offset="11804364">Counsel has misspoken to this Court when he says that the Nine Circuits who have considered the... treating a late filed notice as a motion of appeal have ruled against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.114" offset="11850548">Six circuits, Your Honors, six circuits, have said we either have a rule, or a form that we send to late pro se inmates, or we should be doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.656" offset="11888687">In one circuit, the Second Circuit, in the case of Fearon, 1985, totally went against the majority of the circuits, and declared a late file notice of appeal to the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.230" offset="11939051">I would suggest that the state's argument that Thompson is no longer valid law flies in the face of this Court's decisions, which he cites Lack, Browder, and Griggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.454" offset="11991923">In Browder, the case which he suggests overrules Thompson, this Court cited Thompson for its continued validity in the proposition that Rule 52 and 59 motions are permissible in habeas cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.714" offset="12048975">In neither Griggs nor Lack were any of those three cases, Thompson, Wolfsohn, or Harris Truck Lines, mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.053" offset="12082307">So to imply, as the State has, that those cases have no validity, when this Court has cited them with approval, and not explicitly overruled them, I would suggest is an improper implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.711" offset="12132880">I respectfully disagree with the opinion that finality will never occur if Mr. Houston is given his day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.668" offset="12180736">If we want to see a lack of finality, then tell pro se inmates to file a Rule 60 motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.156" offset="12202679">This Court in Ackerman v. United States has said that a Rule 60 motion is not a substitute for an appeal.</text>
