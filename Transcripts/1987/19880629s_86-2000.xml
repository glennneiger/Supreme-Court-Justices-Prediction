            <label>Ms. Justice O'Connor:</label>
            <text syncTime="5.053" offset="20167">The first is No. 86-2000, United States versus Kozminski.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.993" offset="43886">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.695" offset="74710">In 1983, two mentally retarded men were found living and working on a Michigan dairy farm in squalid conditions and in relative isolation from the rest of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.553" offset="126119">Dairy farmer, Ike Kozminski and his wife and their son John, were charged with violating Section 1584 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code which makes it a crime to hold another person in involuntary servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.259" offset="196963">The Kozminskis were also charged with violating Section 241 of the same code which prohibits conspiracies to interfere with rights secured by the constitutional laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.382" offset="245447">And the conspiracy charged was a conspiracy to interfere with the Thirteenth Amendment right to be free from involuntary servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.632" offset="278465">The Government relied in part on evidence that the Kozminskis had used psychological coercion to cause the victims to believe they had no alternative but to work on the farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.490" offset="321933">The District Court gave the jury a broad definition of the term involuntary servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.544" offset="342100">It encompassed situations involving purely psychological coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.144" offset="360490">The jury found the defendants guilty of some of the charges and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.413" offset="397584">The case was reheard en banc and the Court of Appeals reversed the convictions and remanded the case for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.700" offset="430707">The Court of Appeals ruled that the District Court's definition of involuntary servitude was too broad and also held that it generally can't exists absent the use or threatened use of physical or legal coercion to compel labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.925" offset="495700">And the Court found an exception to the rule in cases where the defendant uses fraud or deceit to compel services from a minor and immigrant or one who is mentally incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.505" offset="538018">We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the meaning of the phrase involuntary servitude for purposes of criminal prosecutions under the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.840" offset="583262">In the opinion filed today, we hold that absent further guidance from Congress, the term involuntary servitude under Sections 241 and 1584 necessarily means a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant either use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury or by the use or threat of coercion through law or the legal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.464" offset="681796">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the convictions must be reversed because the District Court's instruction on involuntary servitude was too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.011" offset="727980">Justice Brennan with whom Justice Marshall joins and Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins, have filed opinions concurring in the judgment.</text>
