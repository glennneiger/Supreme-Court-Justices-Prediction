            <text syncTime="10.087" offset="160292">Very well, Mr. Yturbide, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. B.V. Yturbide</label>
            <text syncTime="64.434" offset="377631">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I am frank to say to the Court at the outset that I am here today with mixed emotions, thrilled, of course, after some 35 years of practice to have at least the opportunity to appear at our judicial summit, but saddened, too, at least chagrined by the irony that this certainly for me the most memorable appearance in my career should be basically traceable to a lapse in my office marking one of the low points of my career, perhaps, the very xx of it, or close to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.285" offset="573027">The Court will recall that contrary to intention, through inadvertence, Jose Torres, one of 16 Hispanic and Black persons intervening as plaintiffs in a potential class action for employment discrimination, was not specifically named along with the rest, and a notice of appeal from a judgment of dismissal which erroneously threw the entire action out of court and which therefore in the ultimate was successfully reversed on the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.180" offset="720671">The notice of appeal had listed his 15 co-intervenors and had used the phrase Mr. Torres, happily for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.912" offset="791515">The omission was not, could not be of any importance, any harm to the trajectory of the appeal because the erroneous reasoning leading to this missile and naturally in consequence the issues argued and resolved on the appeal were not of individualized and varying concern, but were of general and the same concern alike to all the named intervenors as a group, and for that matter to the absent and passive members of the class as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.997" offset="951907">Well, Mr. Yturbide, supposing that instead of reversing the dismissal the Court of Appeals had affirmed the dismissal, and the appellees had sought sanctions against those who appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.017" offset="1011988">Now, I suppose your client would not have been liable for those sanctions, even though the other 15 might have been.</text>

            <label>Mr. B.V. Yturbide</label>
            <text syncTime="229.691" offset="1038633">Oh, the sanctions were very realistically in the picture before the appeal ever came into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.956" offset="1063711">The fact is that as soon as the erroneous dismissal occurred, respondent here, the defendant there, had moved for attorneys' fees and costs as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.417" offset="1125569">So that by not appealing, if that had been the intention, why, he was exposing himself for sure to the possibility of that type of sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.868" offset="1191397">It was not a theoretical thing of the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.934" offset="1231626">But I think on balance that that would hardly have been a serious matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.350" offset="1261301">The fact is that he wanted to appeal in any event, and would of course have been willing to expose himself to the sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.408" offset="1301530">There is some theoretical discussion by my opponent to the effect that actually he didn't want to get into the appeal and it was my idea and I engineered it and dragged him in by the heels, and he would have been fearful of the costs and so forth he would have incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.432" offset="1381673">Why, that is contrary to the only showing that was made on the motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.685" offset="1402676">It was uncontroverted below, and certainly realistically he was already exposed to that, and perhaps the greater danger on balance would have been that the erroneous dismissal by becoming final would expose him to that problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.745" offset="1942888">That is different than the picture presented by the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1171.487" offset="4805804">The Romasanta case recognizes that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1231.747" offset="5046862">I would suggest that in substance there is no difference in that possible difference in phraseology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.143" offset="5088449">The fact remains that there is a benefit of the appeal for the people who are not specified in the notice of appeal any more than Mr. Torres was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.453" offset="5133693">These people would get the benefit of that appeal for certain, but Mr. Torres may not even get let alone equal treatment with the co-intervenors with whom he wished to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.094" offset="5212269">I think that the point that we have to keep in mind in this area is, I think, the pre-eminent, paramount in importance to the wholesomeness of the judicial system is the power of all courts, the preservation, the vigilant preservation of the power of all courts, the inherent power to respond to the dictates of substantive justice in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.946" offset="5411740">Being inherent by definition that power is not derived from and ought not to be irrevocably absolutely court-made rules, making any procedural requirement jurisdictional in the sense of the say all, end all measure of whether the litigant is entitled to protection of an appeal or any other judicial relief that may be given is tantamount to a freakish departure from settled doctrine concerning inherent power, frequent application in a variety of situations, some of which we have mentioned in the briefs, and many of which I am sure the Court is fully familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.723" offset="5630751">There isn't any reason to tap the notice of appeal into some special pigeonhole that immunizes it from the deep scrutiny of that inherent power to do justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.093" offset="5688325">We basically rely on that concept, and it is implicit in the various cases which have in fact, as we have cited, relaxed or overridden noncompliance, excusing noncompliance with appellate rules, including this Court's decision in Foman against Davis, that is reported in 371 U.S. beginning at 178.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.260" offset="5808906">That concept of inherent power is also expressed sometimes in some of the cases which have approached the matter in the constructive fashion that we suggest to the Court is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.082" offset="5868256">Such a case is the San Diego Commission against Governing Board, 790 Fed 2d.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.890" offset="5915486">It is an utterance which I would commend as worthy for allegiance of this Court in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.666" offset="5946623">It was said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.758" offset="5954983">"We have discretion where the interests of substantive justice require it to disregard irregularities in the form or procedure for filing of a notice of appeal. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.639" offset="6026454">That is a commendable utterance, one that is in conformity with inherent power and to do justice and certainly that is something which we have occasion in this Court to give impetus to again and I think should be in the context which is in such... in which seeming disarray and the split among the circuits as to whether there is jurisdictional effect to Rule 3(c) or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.821" offset="6151215">I think when all is said and done what it comes down to is, boils down to is, what was said in the Foman case a quarter century ago, namely, that it is too late in the day and entirely contrary to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for decisions on the merits to be avoided on the basis of such mere technicalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.422" offset="6285588">The Federal Rules reject the approach that pleading, even if we call, in conformity with the prior question, even if we call the notice of appeal something similar to a complaint, that pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may be decisive to the outcome and accept the principle that the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.610" offset="6446398">Years even before that Justice Black in ordering adoption of the revised decisions of this Court, rules of this Court reported in 346 U.S. at Page 945 put it simply and perhaps just as eloquently when he said</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.646" offset="6542529">"The function of procedural rules is... should be to serve as useful guides to help, not hinder persons who have a legal right to bring their problems before the courts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.102" offset="6632286">That certainly is Mr. Torres.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen McKae</label>
            <text syncTime="1637.756" offset="6670947">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the one irreducible fact in this case is that Jose Torres did not file a notice of appeal from the 1981 dismissal of this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.440" offset="6741686">It is not that a notice suggesting that all appellants or all original plaintiffs were appealing was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.996" offset="6783900">It was a notice that specifically named each of the 15 who made that timely notice, and excluded Jose Torres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.341" offset="6825278">The omission of Mr. Torres's name was noted in Oakland Scavenger Company's brief on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.618" offset="6862372">Contrary to what has been suggested about the indication that this may have been the result of clerical error, what the footnote in the brief stated was that Mr. Torres's name had been apparently omitted from the caption in the original complaint by error, but the footnote stated that Mr. Torres had not filed a notice of appeal, and it further stated that he had also not been certified by counsel under Ninth Circuit Rule 13 as a party having an interest in the outcome of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.683" offset="7014614">So there were two indications in that footnote that Mr. Torres was not participating in that appeal, and despite that indication, counsel did not make mention of this fact in his reply brief to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.014" offset="7083995">There was nothing stated on the papers and there was nothing stated at oral argument to suggest that Oakland Scavenger Company was incorrect in its understanding that Mr. Torres did not have an interest and was not participating in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.825" offset="7155257">After the reversal in the Ninth Circuit a petition for writ of certiorari was filed in this Court, and again, Oakland Scavenger Company noted that failure to file a notice of appeal by Mr. Torres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.148" offset="7228504">Mr. Torres's status was left somewhat indefinite by virtue of the fact that counsel had not responded to the footnote and the Court of Appeal had not made mention of the fact that only 15 of the original le plaintiffs had appealed when it issued its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.545" offset="7334039">We on remand notified the District Court in a status conference statement that a motion for summary judgment would be filed seeking to have the court's statement decision that Mr. Torres was no longer entitled to participate in the case, and that is the order from which counsel has taken an appeal, at least one of the two orders from which counsel has taken an appeal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.009" offset="7471966">A motion was filed in District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.100" offset="7488266">It concluded that it had no power to amend the notice of appeal, that because Mr. Torres had not appealed, he was no longer a participant in the action, and the District Court awarded summary judgment to Oakland Scavenger Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.176" offset="7568619">Following that decision Mr. Torres filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit which was timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.544" offset="7618042">At the same time he filed a motion for recall of the mandate from the 1982 decision of the Ninth circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.059" offset="7652106">That motion was denied almost a year prior to the... or better than a year prior to the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari in the matter which is currently before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.778" offset="7711038">The Ninth Circuit upheld the District Court's decision, and Mr. Torres's petition for writ of certiorari from that decision was timely, but it appears that his petition from denial of the recall of mandate was not timely, and that matter should not currently be before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.493" offset="7809886">That makes a difference because if the only matter which the Court is currently considering is the summary judgment issued by the District Court, then it would appear that the District Court's ruling was undeniably correct, the District Court did not have power to amend the notice, that Mr. Torres had not filed a notice of appeal, and under Rule three he was not a party to the 1982 appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.516" offset="7941961">So the issues before the Court are whether the District Court correctly decided that it did not have authority to amend the notice, whether the petition for writ of certiorari from the denial of the motion for recall of mandate was timely, and then, and only if the Court finds that that petition was timely, whether the Court of Appeals clearly abused its discretion in denying the recall of mandate some four years after the earlier appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.042" offset="8092112">Now, this Court has said that the requirement for filing of a timely appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.888" offset="8135476">The rules, that is, Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure does allow for a filing of a motion within 60 days of the decision appealed from seeking to extend the time for filing of notice of appeal for excusable neglect, but Rule 26 states in response to Justice O'Connor's earlier question that the Court of Appeals does not have power to extend the time for filing beyond that time provided in Rule 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.458" offset="8321781">So once that 60 days passes, there is no further opportunity under the rules to seek relief in the way of amendment of the notice of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2124.639" offset="8618428">Counsel had argued for a representative effect, suggesting that if any party, that is, any appealing party in a class action files a timely notice of appeal, that that notice ought to apply to any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.814" offset="8711215">There is no authority for that position in the rules or in the decisional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.288" offset="8733053">The rule, that is, Rule 3 expressly states that the notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties who are filing the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.316" offset="8789164">Rule 3 also speaks in terms of multiparty litigation and suggests that if there is more than one appealing party they may file singly or they may file separately, but as named parties in class action litigation they have an obligation to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.078" offset="8860217">There is nothing to suggest that a named party has any different status in a class action than he has in any other multiparty litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.327" offset="8909223">And he must go forward on procedural matters and he must go forward in making out his case on liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.381" offset="8941406">He cannot count on being included within the framework of class relief if he fails to make out his own case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.129" offset="8984455">Some of the courts based on this Court's 1962 decision in Foman versus Davis have suggested that a somewhat relaxed or more relaxed approach ought to be followed in circumstances which suggest a particular inequity or injustice or excusable neglect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.258" offset="9100961">Foman was concerned with an appeal which... or two notices of appeal which were filed following a judgment, one filed within the time, the correct time following a judgment, but which was premature because there was a post-judgment motion to vacate the judgment pending, and so the time for filing in Foman was tolled by that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.938" offset="9211616">There was also a subsequent notice filed following the decision on the post-judgment motion which itself was timely but which did not mention the earlier judgment, and this Court ruled that the two notices taken together could be taken as a single notice that there was a manifest intent on the part of the appellant to file an appeal, not simply of the denial of the post-judgment motion, but also of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.539" offset="9342019">But in this case, there was no reaction at all to the note in the brief stating that Jose Torres had not filed a notice of appeal and that he was not listed as a party interested in the outcome of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.003" offset="9419969">There was no suggestion, as I have already stated, either in the papers or in oral argument that we were mistaken in our understanding of his intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.180" offset="9464586">So, it would not seem that the notion of manifest intent that is discussed in Foman, not with respect to the naming of the parties, but with respect to the form of the notice of appeal, and the designation of orders appealed from would seem to have any application in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.624" offset="9554447">There also does not appear to have been any excusable oversight which would justify an equitable kind of relief if the Court had authority to grant that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.491" offset="9601886">The standard in the Ninth Circuit has been clear, at least since 1960, as a result of the Cook and Sons case, that every party appealing must be named in the notice of appeal, and that parties who are omitted from the notice of appeal will not be considered to be participating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.056" offset="9688090">In this particular case counsel has stated in his brief to this Court that the decision to take no action was deliberate, that in balancing the risks of bringing the matter to the Court's attention he made a determination that it would not be in his client's best interest do to so, and he states that he feared that there was a danger that the attempted change, that is, a change in the notice would be perceived or regarded as a self-confession of his failure to comply with the court rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.853" offset="9851303">The problem with an indefinite standard, contrary to the standard which has been and consistently has been applied in the Ninth Circuit is that it shifts the burden from the appellant to the appellee to make a determination as to who is participating on the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.639" offset="9942418">It forces the appellee as occurred in this case at some point to make a motion with the court either at the appellate level or at the District Court level to obtain a clarification of that individual's status, and in this particular case that has exposed Oakland Scavenger Company to an additional round of appeals, not only the motion, but the fact that we have come on appeal on that item alone where the matter might possibly have been resolved originally on the first petition for certiorari to this Court following the Ninth Circuit's reversal of the District Court's dismissal of the action, so there has been considerable prejudice to Oakland Scavenger in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.442" offset="10137709">The proceedings with respect to what is a collateral issue have been extended over a period of now four years, and that would not have occurred if there were not some encouragement in the decisions of some of the other circuits for the motion that there may be some situations where the use of terms such as "et al" or some other designation to suggest an intent to appeal would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.451" offset="10305729">Some of the circuits have suggested that there may be a concept of substantial compliance, that use of terms such as 3(c) despite that requirement stating that all parties shall be specified.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.357" offset="11389288">I want to straighten out one thing about this motion that no notice of appeal was filed on behalf of Mr. Torres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.175" offset="11436622">That is the language which in a calmer day in retrospect our opponents have really emphasized, and of course that begs the question in part with reference to the representative effect of the notice that was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.355" offset="11497330">Certain it is that the words Mr. McKae likes it or not, have been held without more to substantially comply with the rule and constitute a notice of appeal on behalf of an unspecified party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.417" offset="11569533">We have cited the Ayres case in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.638" offset="11578415">We have cited the Parrish case in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.560" offset="11586147">They squarely hold that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.712" offset="11594715">Now it is true that the Van Hoose case holds the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.936" offset="11611642">Well, that is just a conflict, and the fact that the Ninth Circuit has come out with one view which Mr. McKae would like to embrace does not resolve the conflict and necessarily point the way in which it ought to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.806" offset="11663156">Now, we have heard again and we have heard throughout respondent's brief in this case something which I must comment on because it is of a factual nature and amounts to what in legislative halls I suppose would be called a point of personal privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.909" offset="11747583">It is a red herring type of argument that has been thrown into this picture recklessly and callously, inspired apparently by the notion so often discredited even on the football field that the best defense is a good offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.816" offset="11843192">It is suggested that rather than wasting all our time here for a good period of our lives on these kind of proceedings, what Mr. Torres ought to have been doing is sue me in a California court for malpractice, deliberate misdeeds and folly, and not seeking to cure an amendment when the omission was... by amendment when the omission was called to our attention and assertedly the position was clearly made that this man had no ongoing interest further in this case and ought not to be treated in the same boat as the other named plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.146" offset="12032527">Now, I defy anyone to read that footnote that is in question and come to the view that it represents a clear position to that effect, and as I suggested in my opening remarks, the fact is that even afterward in the petition for certiorari before this Court the opponents themselves listed Mr. Torres as a person interested in the outcome of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.245" offset="12132837">Now, the fact is that you don't have to make an amendment to get the benefit of the kind of cases that favor our position in this matter against the jurisdictional view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.673" offset="12190620">You don't have to add a name anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.583" offset="12198248">You merely have to hold that the matter was harmless, the omission was harmless, there has been no prejudice, and therefore you should treat him as an ongoing plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.322" offset="12241193">Such was the fact in the Ayres case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.902" offset="12247567">There was no amendment to add his name anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.955" offset="12255717">Nor in the Parrish case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.707" offset="12266689">Nor in the Williams against Frey case, for instance, all of which we have cited in our... there is no question about an amendment, and we are continually charged with having failed or having attacked an order here of the Court, an interim order where they denied a motion to recall and to amend and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.611" offset="12350385">We are not attacking that order except as a possible alternative, raise the possibility that this Court might think that that is a preferable procedure even if it reverse the Court of Appeals at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.790" offset="12403048">We merely say that the Court of Appeals ought not to have affirmed the summary judgment, ought to have reversed the summary judgment, because--</text>
