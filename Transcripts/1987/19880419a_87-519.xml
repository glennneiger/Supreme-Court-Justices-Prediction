            <text syncTime="277.735" offset="1244451">At the outset I would note that this Court has held that qualifying language used in an instruction can render acceptable and appropriate an instruction which might otherwise be infirm.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.385" offset="1379033">Instruction No. 16 defines the terms apart from "especially".</text>
            <text syncTime="316.480" offset="1399409">However, the State would note initially that the use of the word "especially" heinous, atrocious, or cruel serves to channel and qualify those types of murders which are more evil than any murder which is certainly heinous, atrocious, or cruel.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.081" offset="1469835">In addition, the instructions given provided that heinous means extremely wicked or shockingly evil.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.727" offset="1512362">And cruel means pitiless or designed to inflict a high degree of pain, utter indifference to or enjoyment of the suffering of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.383" offset="1546948">These instruction and definitions were given in the disjunctive term and provided further guidance which was not provided to the jury in the Godfrey case.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.038" offset="1701593">And because the discretion was channeled by use of definitions, and because the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals then assessed the definitions and the application of the facts to those definitions, the State submits that sufficient narrowing occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.411" offset="1775154">In this case, the heinousness and atrocity of the crime was evidenced by Defendant Cartwright's intent to get even with the Riddles.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.642" offset="1852059">As pointed out in the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals' opinion, the Defendant either lay in wait our returned under cover of darkness to commit his acts against the Riddles.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.521" offset="2335533">The Defendant fired two shots at Mr. Cartwright, hitting him once in the chest and killing him instantly at that point, but there was a period of psychological torture involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.187" offset="6886168">The portion of the State argument which does relate to this aggravating circumstance appears in the Joint Appendix, and a reading of that will demonstrate that the State did not at all rely upon the treatment of Mrs. Riddle in its argument or allegations that this crime, the murder of Hugh Riddle, was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.422" offset="7163171">And when the Tenth Circuit considered on rehearing the interpretation and construction of this aggravating circumstance in Mr. Cartwright's case, it determined that Oklahoma, that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals had not adopted a construction of especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel which provided any standard that guided and limited a jury's discretion to impose death.</text>

            <text syncTime="3487.212" offset="14082276">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.979" offset="14121355">There is no dictate in the Constitution of the United States or in the plurality opinion in Godfrey v. Georgia which would mandate a requirement of physical abuse prior to the existence of a finding that the statutory aggravating circumstance of an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.132" offset="14202021">As Justice Stevens pointed out earlier, an argument, and I would concur that the circumstance can be proven by either focus upon the Defendant's intent, or upon the suffering inflicted by the victim regardless of whether or not there was an intent to torture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.834" offset="14280806">In this case, we do have clear objective standards which provided guidance to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.918" offset="14305153">We have the existence of the use of the word "especially".</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.371" offset="14318945">We have the definitions which were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.953" offset="14329290">And although those definitions were not explicitly cited in Proffitt, they were in State v. Dixon which was cited to in the Proffitt decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.569" offset="14367742">The Proffitt language was approved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.885" offset="14396999">However, the State would submit that Proffitt is not the only constitutional interpretation of this particular aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.370" offset="14434929">It is our position that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, in the issue on rehearing in Stouffer, was compelled by what it felt to be the dictates of federal constitutional law to alter its long-time previous opinion, and it did so with great haste in order to avoid refusing to follow the current status of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.545" offset="14531686">There is not a subjective standardless approach used in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.753" offset="14576513">Certainly the definitions, the application of the facts to the crime in this case, as reflected in the opinion of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, indicates that this decision was certainly more objective in assessing that the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel more so than with regard to other circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.709" offset="14668255">All circumstances are not capable of equal objectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.091" offset="14685809">Some states have, as an aggravating circumstance, that which is clearly objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.585" offset="14711827">For example, that the victim was pregnant at the time of the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.079" offset="14733770">That is something that either exists or does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.710" offset="14744323">Along the lines of the continuum there, this Court has approved the existence of the notion that the Defendant constitutes a continuing threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.197" offset="14782253">And certainly that is less objective than the standard that we have here before this Court wherein you can look at the killer's intent, or you can look at the suffering endured, be it psychological or physical suffering.</text>
