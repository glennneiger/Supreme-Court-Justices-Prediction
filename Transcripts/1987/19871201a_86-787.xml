            <text syncTime="67.567" offset="410354">Mr. Chief Justice, honorable associate Justices, if it may please the Court, this is a case that will determine whether Mr. Feiock and the Feiocks of this country may sit on their hands and defy with impunity valid court orders to provide support for their minor children.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.637" offset="482661">This case originated in the State of Ohio when Alta Sue Feiock, the mother of respondent's three children, petitioned the Ohio courts for support under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, URESA.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.319" offset="545354">The petition was forwarded to California, where the Orange County District Attorney's office in turn filed a petition with the California Superior Court seeking an order for support.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.487" offset="586001">Following a hearing an order for support was entered directing payment of $50 per month per child, and that was in fact a reduction from the original $75 per month per child which had been ordered at the time of the divorce some eight years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.215" offset="652979">The Orange County District Attorney's office was acting in this case not as the public prosecutor, but as the attorney for Alta Sue Feiock for the sole purpose of gaining the support due her and her children.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.553" offset="714314">This was not a welfare case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1179.059" offset="4856290">His failure to seek modification causes the missed payments to accrue and build in arrearage, which some day he is going to have to pay, as he was ordered to pay even in this case, because even though he was found not guilty on some of the months of contempt, at the time of the hearing he was still found able to pay in installments and was ordered to make payments even for those months for which he could not have been held in contempt because of the coercive nature of it and the fact that the missed support payments accrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.263" offset="5005188">Now, a reasonable person would seek to modify that order if he truly had no ability to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.057" offset="5036326">And his failure to seek modification is a tacit admission that the order remains valid and reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.302" offset="5073315">And that is especially true in California, having enacted a code section, Civil Code 4700.1, that makes it extremely easy for an individual to modify a support order.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Lynn Schwartzberg</label>
            <text syncTime="1614.618" offset="6598553">Mr. Chief Justice and the associate Justices of the Supreme Court, and may it please the Court, the issue, contrary to a number of the amicus briefs that were filed in this case, I would suggest, is rather narrow, and I would suggest it has almost no national importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.140" offset="6680682">What we are here to decide is the interpretation of a very specific California statute which affects a civil contempt in the criminal venue for only California makes that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.416" offset="6741704">What I would suggest, however, is that the significance of this debate concerns almost a century of California jurisprudence concerning civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.878" offset="6787575">What I would suggest to the Court is that there are a number of rigs which this Court in Boykin versus Alabama has applied to criminal cases, which, if this Court adopts the position of the petitioner, will eviscerate, will essentially vacate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.670" offset="6850791">Those rights are self-incrimination, both the right not to have to testify and the right not to be called as witnesses, the right to counsel in California, and I would suggest a right which is perhaps more fundamental than those rights in Boykin versus Alabama, that is the right to have proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to each and every element of the charge as contained in the case, this Court's case of In re Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.238" offset="6941070">I would suggest that whether 1209.5 violated the Fifth Amendment involves three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.908" offset="6967715">The first question is, does 1209, which is the general scheme for contempts in California, define a crime with the element of the ability to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.280" offset="7001256">Second, if it does, may this Court redefine that definition of a crime to suit the Court's federal interpretation of what a civil contempt is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.558" offset="7046292">And finally, does it offend the Fifth Amendment if it is a crime?</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.930" offset="7063846">I think that the answer to whether 1209 defines a crime in California is an unequivocal yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.144" offset="7096656">In fact, all the Court needs to do is to turn to a case which was decided in the 1940s called Bennet versus Superior Court, and I would merely quote the first line of the third paragraph on Page 210, where the Court says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.562" offset="7146288">"Contempt of court is a specific criminal offense. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.294" offset="7165305">Now, they get that from McClatchie versus Superior Court, which is at 119 Cal. They get that from In Ex Parte Gould, which is at 99 Cal., both 1800s California Supreme Court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.258" offset="7221103">Now, one of the questions that the Court asked Mr. Capizzi was, why is it that the Court of Appeal dealt in sense with such short shrift with the question of whether it was criminal or not, and the answer is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.347" offset="7265511">They knew what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.924" offset="7271781">And there wasn't any need to have any particular extended analysis of that issue because every Court of Appeal knows what it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1895.317" offset="7721400">It is the same reason, I think, that the Supreme Court in Culver City tried to make it clear that California was not... I think the problem here is that the legislature used the label "civil".</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.889" offset="7927663">And their conclusion was that once you had it as a crime, then the decision such as this Court's decision in Rylander do not have any effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.401" offset="7961727">And then that, in essence, once you determine this is a criminal act, a crime punishable as a crime in California, that this Court's opinions then presuppose that various rights inure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.146" offset="8180633">And what I would suggest to the Court and I tried to present it in my brief, which is that California has a very unusual legislative scheme which is that we have 166, which is a specific penal statute governing contempt of court and it covers the same act, the same exact act that is prosecuted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.371" offset="8257537">The difference between 1209 and criminal intent in 166 is that only the people in the State of California can bring a 166 action, but a civil litigant, in other words, a custodial parent, typically, the mother, can hire counsel and bring a civil contempt which is a criminal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.128" offset="8336636">And for that reason, what I am suggesting is that the California Supreme Court in Culver City and going all the way back to Gould said there are... all these contempts are contained in different places in our legislative scheme, but they are all the same crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2234.429" offset="9077782">Well, I think the answer to that is that if the California court's interpretation is unambiguous that notwithstanding the fact that this may only involve an administrative penalty, whether it is loss of license, loss of privilege, loss of money or jail, I think that if the California court says that in California, that act is a crime, then I think this court, not bound to accept that determination, in effect, I think this Court must apply those Federal constitutional guarantees which apply to a criminal act within the context of this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.019" offset="9256146">So, I would concede, for instance, that this Court does not require counsel in every criminal proceeding, but that does not mean that in those criminal proceedings where the Court does require counsel.</text>
