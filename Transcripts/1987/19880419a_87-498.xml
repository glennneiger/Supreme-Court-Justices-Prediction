            <text syncTime="11.500" offset="185359">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.722" offset="198211">This case arises under the Federal Tort Claims Act which embodies Congress's broad waiver of governmental immunity and consent to suit for the tortuous conduct of government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.567" offset="245649">The conduct complained of here is negligent execution of Section 262(d) of the Public Health Service Act and following regulations which govern the licensing and release of live poliovirus vaccines.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.179" offset="304059">The issue presented involves the applicability of Section 2680(a) of the Tort Claims Act which sets forth an exception to the waiver of immunity to the conduct at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.599" offset="349721">The immunity preserved by 2680(a) is underpinned by separation of powers principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.921" offset="375007">It is intended to prevent the judiciary, through the medium of an action in tort, from second guessing the reasonableness of executive policy judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.088" offset="415654">This Court has consistently held that what is protected by 2680(a) is executive prerogative; decisionmaking grounded in social, economic and political policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.927" offset="467063">Congress used two clauses to accomplish its purpose of 2680(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="87.070" offset="487647">The first recognizes that conduct which obediently executes policy embodies that policy, is the policy made manifest.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.637" offset="529861">A challenge to such conduct is an attack on the policy itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.942" offset="551073">The first clause, therefore, protects conduct in execution of a statute or regulation provided due care is exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.236" offset="588271">Now under the first clause, it does not matter whether the conduct itself is discretionary or nondiscretionary so long as it represents faithful execution of the regulatory plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.074" offset="635605">The second clause in Section 2680(a) protects discretionary conduct, the exercise of discretionary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.899" offset="670923">Now whether the conduct here warrants the protection of the second clause, since it has forfeited any claim to immunity under the first clause, requires examination of the statute and the regulations which give this agency its power to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.550" offset="733512">The powers and duties of the agency with respect to licensing biologic products, including live virus vaccines, were defined by Congress in Section 262(d) of the Public Health Service Act which directs that licenses may be issued only upon a showing that the product meets regulatory standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.875" offset="818880">The statute provides no exemptions to the requirements of regulatory compliance, and it does not authorize the agency to act according to its judgment of the best course in deciding whether compliance is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.784" offset="874469">The agency's regulations reflect that statutory mandate in providing that licenses may be issued only upon examination of the product and upon demonstrated regulatory compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.203" offset="928176">The regulatory standards particularly applicable to live poliovirus vaccines are specifically charted in 42 CFR 73.110.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.951" offset="975092">They cover three characteristics of the vaccines: safety, potency and antigenicity, each of which is reduced to a numerical value.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.607" offset="1017724">For example, under 73.115, the data must demonstrate that the concentration of live virus particles in the vaccine is between 200,000 and 500,000 TCID per dose.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.985" offset="1067252">Under 73.117, antigenicity, there are specific pre and post-treatment ratios of type-specific antibodies that must be demonstrated before the vaccine is in compliance with that standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.008" offset="1207373">That does raise one point, though, because there is some contention in the briefs about exactly what is licensed under this statute: Is it the strain, is it a seed virus, is it a vaccine.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.004" offset="1251363">Now the government has contended, and we are willing to accept for present purposes, that the license is issued for the poliovirus vaccine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3464.111" offset="13995775">Just briefly I would like to address the suggestion that's been made that if you can find discretion anywhere in this regulatory scheme, that you need not look at the specific allegations of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.258" offset="14048333">That argument, that approach to immunity is contradicted by the language of the statute itself, by its legislative history, and by every case that this Court has considered construing the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.167" offset="14095981">The second clause of 2680(a) talks about the exercise of discretionary function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.401" offset="14120954">The legislative history which was reviewed and set out by the court in Dalehite at Note 21, I believe it's Page 29, talks about protection for discretionary acts, and for the exercise of discretionary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.759" offset="14178319">So you cannot look beyond our specific allegations of negligence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.254" offset="14196395">It doesn't matter if in some other part of the regulations the agency may have had discretion in making some other kind of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.278" offset="14228474">I think you are bound to look at our allegations of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.551" offset="14241535">And to extend the inquiry beyond that again would be to create the equivalent of a per se exception, because at some point in every scheme you are going to be able to find some discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.599" offset="14293675">That's not the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.271" offset="14300467">The test is whether or not discretion has ended by the time you get down to the level of conduct that the Petitioners are complaining of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.755" offset="14334322">In this case, there is no principled basis for distinguishing between a truck driver who runs a red light which, after all, is no more than a nondiscretionary directive not to proceed.</text>
