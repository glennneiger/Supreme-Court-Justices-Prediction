            <text syncTime="12.558" offset="191698">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves an ordinance of the City of Lakewood that gives the mayor contract authority to rent the city's treeline property for the placement of news boxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.198" offset="242271">There are three issues that I would like to relate before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.769" offset="260557">The three are jurisdiction, discretion, and insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.304" offset="278738">Whether there is jurisdiction to pass on the merits of the case, which was pointed out at Page 43 of the brief, whether the discretion given by the ordinance to the mayor and the architect review board are so uncontrolled as to be unconstitutional, and the constitutionality of the insurance requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.516" offset="351567">We will attempt to demonstrate the Plain Dealer did not apply for a permit, did not exhaust its administrative remedies and appeals, and did not properly test the ordinance to assert the issues before the Court to permit passing on the merits of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.727" offset="416351">We will try to demonstrate that the discretion is not uncontrolled, and that the insurance requirement, being content neutral and otherwise reasonable, is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.016" offset="457520">Factually, the original Lakewood ordinance banned all structures, not just news boxes, all structures on the city property.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.185" offset="574235">The city engineer so testified, and the court also found so.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.506" offset="591476">There would have been no discretion of the mayor to have been applied and they could have had the news boxes installed since 1984.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.487" offset="3627427">The mayor has to say why he does this or that or the other thing, and he has to give his reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.057" offset="3645713">I don't see what else we could do to make this any better, and certainly it is ten times... it is 100 times better than what you had in Greer versus Spock and also in the Gannett case.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.680" offset="3688240">As to the mayor, we have the reasonable and necessary provision for relocation, as I indicated, and other things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.571" offset="3735783">The reasonable... we have the location standard provided, whether the architecture review board was done, the terms of the lease, and then plus the mayor must say if he is going to deny what the reasons are, and it has to be only for the reasons of a health and safety hazard, or there is a nuisance, or that they would interfere with the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.086" offset="3825853">A lot has been said about censorship in this thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="935.396" offset="3883114">And then when they reapply for the next year, assuming that it is profitable to them and they want to continue with it, how would the mayor be able to come up with a good reason for denying when it was there the whole time?</text>
            <text syncTime="946.268" offset="3926581">Either he has got a good reason for denying it or he doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.620" offset="3935985">So I find it very difficult as to the censorship and I would point out that they would have had their permits if they had applied for them.</text>
