            <text syncTime="59.789" offset="365707">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Black Lung Benefits Act is a federally based workers compensation program which provides benefits on account of total disability or death of a coalminer due to black lung disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.964" offset="422445">Hundreds of thousands of claimants have been awarded billions of dollars in benefits in this program by proving their entitlement to these benefits under a regulation which is called the interim presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.487" offset="468525">Since its inception 15 years ago, the two agencies which promulgated and have administered this presumption, the Social Security Administration, and after them the Department of Labor, have required proof of an indication of fact by a preponderance of the relevant evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.733" offset="541563">The Fourth Circuit in its divided opinion below strikes down the preponderance rule for invocation of this presumption and replaces it with a new rule which requires invocation on virtually any evidence at all in isolation from the record and whether or not that evidence is reliable and accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.747" offset="625573">The Fourth Circuit's rule is, we think, unprecedented in the context presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.949" offset="646366">It effectively strips claim defendants of the right to answer critical evidence where it is most significant in the analysis of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.721" offset="677504">We think it stands for the proposition that one party's proof in an important point in the case is simply better than another'.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.743" offset="709583">The question that is presented here for this Court is whether in the invocation of this presumption the claimant must establish invocation by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.949" offset="754409">We think that he must, and we think so for two reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.815" offset="1769841">Now, when you take this in the context of the interim presumption, what we find is that the invocation of the presumption presumes that all three of the statutory elements are present, but invocation facts generally do not prove that any one of the basic elements of entitlement are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.994" offset="1854582">Now, there is one exception to that where an invocation fact may prove but one element but there is no invoca... fact that proves two.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.010" offset="1942667">Evidence of the type which is required to establish invocation of the presumption typically and generally cannot prove rebuttal, but even more important, invocation facts are not rebuttal facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.251" offset="1995538">The claimant could establish invocation in the sorts of cases that are presented here by proving but one of several simple medical facts, that he has an x-ray, a biopsy which is indicative of some clinical lung disease, or that he has ventilatory studies or arterial blood gas test data which when looking simply at the raw data is indicative of a chronic impairment of respiratory function, or that there is physician opinion evidence that the individual is totally disabled by a respiratory or pulmonary impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.174" offset="2139316">Looking at these three, these four presumption invocation facts, it should be clear that perhaps with the possible exception of the x-ray fact, which could be established, that we are not talking about the basic fundamental elements of entitlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.654" offset="2229178">We cannot within the terms of the presumption come back in the rebuttal phase and say that claimant's invocation evidence, his blood gas evidence or his ventilatory study evidence is completely false or invalid because it proves nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.180" offset="2287274">It does not prove, as we are required to do, negative of one of the three basic elements of entitlement in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.357" offset="2347983">Invocation facts are left behind us and the focus changes to the presumed facts, and again here we are required to prove the negative of those presumed facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="944.309" offset="3903836">What you can do with an autopsy study arguably is use it in the first instance to determine under the first section of the invocation provision whether the individual has coalworkers' pneumoconiosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.717" offset="3957439">That is the place where that kind of evidence is listed and where that kind of evidence ought to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.186" offset="3979277">It is a logical and orderly pattern where like kind evidence is considered with other like kind evidence in a reasonably logical fashion under the government's rule and under the rule that we are espousing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.178" offset="4027343">We are not suggesting that evidence which is in mismatch ought to be considered together.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.665" offset="4053256">What we are suggesting is, and the original argument, I think, where this line of questioning began is that the invocation facts which have to be proven by the claimant and the rebuttal facts which we are required to prove create an essential mismatch, and since there is no bursting bubble, once we get past the invocation phase and this logical and orderly consideration of the facts which need to be proven in a burden-shifting presumption, that we reach the point where the evidence makes sense, or the consideration of the evidence makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.690" offset="4205393">The preponderance standard for consideration of invocation evidence that has been adopted by the government is the traditional rule for application in a burden-shifting presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.984" offset="4274565">It is logical and it is fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.469" offset="4280417">It has worked well for many years and there has been no reason to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.138" offset="4295150">Indeed, we think the Fourth Circuit had no reason to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.674" offset="4305285">Congress has had the opportunity to look at it twice, and has found no reason to comment on the agency's approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.078" offset="4330885">The rule simply gives all parties their day in court on the whole case, not just a part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.415" offset="4356276">It does not deny benefits to deserving claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.600" offset="4369024">It simply requires valid proof of a single fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.819" offset="4381876">We think that the preferable methodology for the resolution of the questions that are presented here is the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.158" offset="4415209">I say that because it is in the Administrative Procedure Act that Congress has spoken on the issue that is presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.098" offset="4446974">I also say that because we have had a terrible problem in this program with uncertainty in the rules and standards of proof that have applied... that have been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.953" offset="4486366">There are virtually no two circuits that agree on anything in the application of either the rebuttal or invocation provisions of this presumption or the standards of proof that apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.594" offset="4532969">We think that this is an appropriate place for the Administrative Procedure Act to come in, and indeed the Administrative Procedure Act does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.831" offset="4561912">Looking specifically at the invocation provisions, in Steadman versus the Securities and Exchange Commission, this Court held after a comprehensive review of the legislative history of the APA that the proponent of a sanction is required to prove the facts necessary to support it by substantial, that is, by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.994" offset="4642578">Evidence pro and con, similarly, evidence which is relevant to other evidence of the same sort must be weighed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.082" offset="4670895">So says the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.600" offset="4676956">Steadman also holds that where the quantum of proof required to prove a fact is not specified in the underlying statutes, that is where the Administrative Procedure Act steps in in a program in which it is applicable to supply the preponderance standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.527" offset="4736724">This holding in Steadman with no great leap of logic reasonably and naturally extends to invocation of a burden-shifting presumption like the interim presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.650" offset="4769220">Invocation and rebuttal under the interim presumption are separate and distinct fact inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.369" offset="4796074">Some party bears some burden by some quantity of evidence to prove invocation of this presumption, but it is not specified in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.594" offset="4836930">What the statute does specify is that the APA applies, and we think, as in Steadman, that the APA supplies the preponderance rule for invocation as well as for rebuttal of this presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1282.843" offset="5257919">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, under the regulations at issue here, a miner with ten or more years of coal mine experience need only establish one of four basic facts in order to create a presumption of compensable disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.391" offset="5360110">For example, he can prove the existence of pneumoconiosis by virtue of certain x-ray, biopsy, or autopsy evidence, or he can prove a disabling pulmonary impairment by virtue of certain test evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.503" offset="5420610">Once he establishes the basic fact in question, the burden then shifts to the mine owner or the director to rebut the presumption of compensable disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.311" offset="5467839">The regulations only permit the mine owner to rebut the presumption by establishing either that the miner is not disabled or that he does not suffer from pneumoconiosis or that his condition is not caused by coal mine employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.706" offset="5545370">The word "establish" in the rebuttal provisions has been universally interpreted at the director's urging to mean proved by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.247" offset="5591555">The question presented here is what the burden of proof is on the miner at the initial invocation stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.370" offset="5632097">The regulations there also state that he must establish the basic fact in question, and the director has interpreted the word "established" there to mean the same thing it means in the rebuttal portion of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.314" offset="5691865">That is, he must prove the fact in question by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.933" offset="5710360">The regulations on this point are not ambiguous, but what I hope to show is that only the director's interpretation can ultimately be squared with the language of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.943" offset="5766366">I would like to deal straightaway with what appears to be the greatest problem for the director's interpretation, and that is the first invocation category, which permits the presumption to be invoked upon proof that a chest x-ray, biopsy or autopsy establishes the existence of pneumoconiosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.122" offset="5855078">Viewed in isolation, the singular there, the reference to a chest x-ray might seem to support the Court of Appeals' view of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.514" offset="5900636">In fact, seen in context, the language strongly supports the director's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.132" offset="5919130">The language of that invocation category is taken directly verbatim from the 1972 regulations of the Social Security Administration dealing with black lung claims filed prior to July of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.492" offset="5980570">The consistent interpretation of that exact same language is that the miner must prove the facts in question by a preponderance of all the evidence in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.485" offset="6036472">The reason for that is that the regulation requires that the claimant establish the fact in question, and requires that he establish the existence of pneumoconiosis, and that suggests a process of weighing the evidence, of weighing all the like kind evidence and evaluating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.661" offset="6097181">The regulation may be inartfully drafted to make that point, but with six years of consistent interpretation requiring proof by a preponderance of the evidence, the reincorporation of precisely the same language in the new regulations should have the same effect as that language in the old regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.890" offset="7834115">The controlling rule in this matter of whether the administrative interpretation be given substantial deference is whether it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation or clearly frustrates the statutory mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.400" offset="7900152">The Fourth Circuit in reviewing the director's interpretation of the regulation found that the agency's interpretation renders the regulation internally inconsistent, and it is plainly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.445" offset="7964414">The Fourth Circuit gave a clear and common sense ruling to 203(a), finding that a coal miner who shows that he has been employed in a coal mining employment for ten years will have the benefit of the presumption that he suffers from pneumoconiosis and is permanently disabled from that disease if he shows a chest x-ray and a recent medical opinion under (a)1 and (a)4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.279" offset="8079666">They found that the clear reading of that regulation shows that you have to produce only one single piece of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.035" offset="8106729">As to (a)2 and (a)3 on ventilatory studies and blood gas studies, they found that studies, for example, in ventilatory studies you have to produce three different tests before the quality standards applied in the statute will allow that to be a valid test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.531" offset="8192724">So they also found that you only had to produce one breathing study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.333" offset="8207875">The petitioner argues that that construction by the Fourth Circuit violates the black lung benefits section at 413(b) and that all relevant evidence is not considered at the invocation stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.050" offset="8742758">The problem is, who carries the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.935" offset="8754356">The problem that we are finding at the Administrative Law Judge level is a coal miner is treated by his treating physician, who might have ordered one or two x-rays, determined that he has a disease, and does not continue granting or ordering x-rays.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.665" offset="8829276">It is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.765" offset="8833664">But at the time of the hearing the coal operator will come in and have sent that x-ray to ten or twelve different doctors and have ten or twelve negative readings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.056" offset="8882774">So at that time when they are looking to see under (a)1 who wins, it does not become who has the best evidence, who has the quality of evidence, it becomes a numbers game, and claimants' attorneys have begun to call it a numbers game.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.784" offset="8957694">We believe that by invoking just one piece of evidence then takes the burden off of the coal miner to produce all this substantial amount of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.931" offset="9030314">It then puts the burden upon the coal operator or the director to rebut those presumptions, and at that point, as the Fourth Circuit had ruled in reviewing all the relevant evidence, then the Court looks at everything that the coal company has put in, and using the director's position, where they say that all like kind evidence will be looked at at (a)1 in the invocation stage, but when you go to rebuttal it cannot be used again, it clearly shows what the Fourth Circuit says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.389" offset="9188094">Under their interpretation the rebuttal stage is superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.925" offset="9202304">Take, for example, the x-rays.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.127" offset="9215052">If you weigh all the x-rays and the administrative Law Judge finds that the invocation is invoked at (a)1, then there is no way that they can rebut that the person suffers from pneumoconiosis because... and under their definition in (b) they cannot reweigh the x-ray reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.973" offset="9306481">Even a doctor's opinion cannot reweigh the x-ray reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.425" offset="9320273">So it shows that the Fourth Circuit is right in that the rebuttal was superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.014" offset="9346605">It conflicts or it violates 203(b) in that 203(b) directly says that all relevant evidence shall be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.287" offset="9383698">And I would also suggest that in that case it makes the presumption irrebuttable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.358" offset="9403970">Now, the basic reason that the Fourth Circuit believed that it is correct is because of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.095" offset="9430928">I don't believe it is a conflict that this is an unusual piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.713" offset="9449423">Congress has singled out victims of one industry to develop a program that would benefit them from a disease that they derive from that industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.508" offset="9516610">Congress intended the program to be extremely liberal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.876" offset="9534059">They intended that, for the most part, that the burden be upon the code operator or the director, and under the Circuit Court's construction of this regulation the miner could raise the presumption of totally disabling pneumoconiosis with a minimum of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.492" offset="9620577">Then the burden of persuasion is shifted to the director or the code operator to go forward and produce the evidence where they are in a better position to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.134" offset="9667075">The procedure avoids placing on the miner, who can least afford it, the burden of responding, at least initially, to a plethora of medical evidence more easily generated by the operator, and again, that is in what we call the numbers game, the code operator has the ability by going out and contacting doctors, in report after report, to completely overwhelm the coal miner, and the director's interpretation of this regulation allows that to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.259" offset="9827571">It completely wipes out the remedial intention of the legislation of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.447" offset="9856410">As far as the APA Act applying, we find it interesting that on one hand the petitioner would ask that you follow the director's interpretation of the regulations, but he does not accept the director's interpretation does not apply, but at any rate, I believe that the section which incorporates the APA and the Black Lung Act, 30 USC 932(a), specifically states that it may be excluded by regulations of the Secretary.</text>
