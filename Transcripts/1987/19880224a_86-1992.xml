            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text syncTime="60.612" offset="384390">Mr Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether the Ninth Circuit was correct in ordering citizenship for the 16 respondents, all Philippine veterans of World War Two, under a statute that expired in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.379" offset="491388">We submit that this Court has already answered that question in 1973 in INS versus Hibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.273" offset="523048">The Court in Hibi held that the Attorney General's action in withdrawing the vice consul from the Philippines and the government's failure to publicize the program did not give rise to an equitable basis for disregarding the December 31st, 1946, cutoff, and as I will explain during this argument, respondent's argument is nothing more than a change of label.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.367" offset="615417">The substantive argument made in this case is identical to that rejected in Hibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.001" offset="633912">We further submit that Hibi was correctly decided and that there is no basis for this Court to overrule it.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.267" offset="667035">To begin with, the relief ordered by the Ninth Circuit in this case is foreclosed by four naturalization statutes in addition to the 1946 cutoff in Hibi, and as I will explain, those statutes prohibit a court from ordering citizenship under the expired and repealed 1940 Act even as to those situations in which there was a timely application under the 1940 Act that was still pending and had not been ruled upon, and we submit that these naturalization statutes are dispositive for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.359" offset="807365">First, as this Court made clear in Fedorenko and indeed as early as the Ginsberg case, a court has no equitable authority to disregard statutory requirements for citizenship and more generally the Court of Appeals' invocation of its equitable authority in violation of statutory mandate is in fact an abuse of equitable authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.467" offset="915825">We submit it is well established that a court of equity may not order relief that is contrary to the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.674" offset="948635">In addition, it is our position that the underlying premise of the Court of Appeals opinion is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.928" offset="977683">In our view the Attorney General's actions were entirely lawful and were within his discretion under the 1940 Act, and as I will explain, that is true for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.616" offset="1024390">First, Section 705 of the Act left it to the Attorney General to decide where to place examiners, when to place them, and for how long.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.031" offset="1062007">In addition, the decision in this case, the revocation of the vice consul's authority was based on bona fide foreign policy concerns, and as this Court has made clear in numerous cases cited in the government's briefs, a high degree of judicial deference must be given in the context of executive foreign policy decisions, and that applies a fortiori, when a Court is reviewing those decisions four decades later.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.649" offset="1168482">In addition, there is added discretion in this case because there is no evidence whatsoever that Congress disagreed with what the Attorney General did.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.506" offset="1203904">In fact, as we have explained, all of the statutory enactments since the 1940 Act only confirm that the Attorney General acted lawfully in what he did.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.869" offset="1273390">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.471" offset="1279763">First of all, as we have explained in our brief, it is anything but clear whether that statute was intended to apply to individuals who enlisted or were inducted in the Philippines, and the Attorney General had to answer a number of difficult issues before he even determined that it applied there, particularly in the context of the Philippine Commonwealth Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.619" offset="1380387">It is anything but clear that Congress intended to authorize the naturalization of some quarter of a million individuals who are serving in their own army.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.964" offset="1413824">We have naturalized a lot of them, though, over there, didn't we?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text syncTime="321.106" offset="1426363">We did, that's true, and in fact that serves to undermine respondent's argument that there was something invideous about what was being done.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.371" offset="1459381">That only confirms that the decision was made for legitimate foreign policy reasons, but going beyond that, Justice Blackmun, the statute as described by the eight dissenting justices below is completely open ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.408" offset="1507551">There is no mandate that the Attorney General place an examiner in any particular location or for any particular period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.396" offset="1539525">It is left up to his discretion, and as we have pointed out in our brief, the three-month period in which an examiner was actually placed in the Philippines before his authority was revoked compares quite favorably and is perhaps comparable to the post to post rotation system that was employed elsewhere in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.901" offset="1617474">So ultimately it may be in fact that these respondents and others similarly situated had as much access to an examiner as soldiers elsewhere in the world, so we don't think there is anything in the statute that compelled the Attorney General to leave an examiner there, and indeed we submit it was entirely within his discretion to do what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.883" offset="1705455">And again, I would point out that the subsequent Congressional statutes only confirm that.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.929" offset="1725621">We have in 1946, while the statute was still in effect, we have Congress passing a statute indicating that membership in the Philippine Commonwealth Army does not constitute membership in the United States armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.359" offset="1779329">That directly contradicts the Ninth Circuit's assumption that the plain reading of the statute compelled the Attorney General to apply the program in the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.838" offset="1821230">We have the 1948 statute which made clear that enlisting or being inducted in the Philippines does not entitled the individual to citizenship unless that person is later a lawful, permanent resident of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.796" offset="1881102">The same provision in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.888" offset="1889461">There is simply no evidence whatsoever that this program was intended to apply in the Philippines, and we challenged respondents to cite anything in the legislative history either to show that the program was initially intended to apply in the Philippines or some recognition on the part of Congress that the Attorney General had erred or engaged in misconduct, and they have not cited any, so we would submit in light of that complete absence of anything by Congress to contradict what the Attorney General did and given the foreign policy concerns that were the basis for the decision, it would be particularly inappropriate to second guess that decision 40 years later.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.220" offset="2446810">Then we still think for several reasons that that is not dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.344" offset="2463319">In fact, let me take it at several different levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.846" offset="2477321">The Second Circuit in Olegario, the reasoning of which we agree with on the statute, assumed for purposes of the decision that the statute was intended to apply to the Philippines, but what the Court said was, that is only the beginning of the question, because the President in revoking his authority had discretion to do so under Section 705 of the statute, and more particularly as a result of the foreign affairs concerns that were the basis for the revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.086" offset="2602291">So it would be our submission that even if Congress had been clear that the statute was intended to apply to the Philippines, that in light of the foreign policy issue that faced the executive and in light of the very reasonable and tailored response of the Attonrey General, that was within his authority under the 1940 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.620" offset="2680449">Furthermore, even if the conduct is considered to be erroneous, in other words, if the Attorney General had acted under a misperception, we think that Hibi still forecloses the claim because it is not enough to simply err.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.692" offset="2752652">As the court indicated, there was no affirmative misconduct there and accordingly no basis for ordering equitable relief four decades later, so we think that Hibi would be dispositive regardless of whether or not this Court agrees with us on the interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.304" offset="2819107">We bring that out about whether the program was intended to apply in the Philippines only to reinforce our position that this Court has to weigh on the one hand a clear Congressional intent expressed over the years from the 1940 statute itself through 1961 and repeated statutes of the public policy that the '40 Act expires, it is revoked, and that all petitions have to be considered under current law, and the Court has to balance that against a rather vague, at best, intention on the part of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.837" offset="2949301">And as we indicated, if Congress was so concerned about the individuals in the Commonwealth Army obtaining citizenship it would have been astonishing for Congress to come along in 1948 and explicitly made clear that enlistment or induction in the Philippines does not qualify someone for citizenship unless he later becomes a lawful permanent resident.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.253" offset="4006947">If I could turn back just briefly to the Hibi point, the veteran in Hibi made essentially a two-part argument in the Court of Appeals and in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.273" offset="4070999">His argument was, Number One, that the Attorney General deliberately violated the 1940 Act, and that Number Two, present day citizenship was therefore appropriate as an equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.303" offset="4123140">Now, the Ninth Circuit in Hibi adopted this two-part analysis, and we submit that if the case caption of the name and the references to parties were removed, the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Hibi is virtually a carbon copy of its current opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.874" offset="4185416">There is really no analytical distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.346" offset="4195342">The Court first said that the Attorney General violated the will of Congress, and secondly that citizenship was appropriate as an equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.193" offset="4234735">Now, this Court summarily reversed and held that the conduct of the Attorney General at issue was not affirmative misconduct and therefore could not have stopped the enforcement of the statutory cutoff date, and in the conclusion of its opinion the Court stated in no uncertain terms the respondent's effort to claim citizenship under a statute which by its terms had expired more than 20 years before he filed his lawsuit must therefore fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.463" offset="4355734">And now we have somebody coming in with the same identical arguments, the same two-part analysis, and arguing for citizenship, and we think that Hibi is controlling, and we agree with the dissenting judges below that there is simply no meaningful difference between saying that the government is equitably estopped from raising a statutory cutoff and disregarding the cutoff as a matter of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.010" offset="4462000">Furthermore, we would submit Hibi is not only dispositive of the statutory arguments, but is dispositive of the constitutional arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.440" offset="4507662">Now, let me say at the outset that it is important to emphasize that the Court of Appeals did not reach the constitutional issues, so it simply makes no sense to distinguish Hibi on the around that these parties are raising constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.389" offset="4571505">That would only be a distinction as a way of defending the Court of Appeals case if the Court of Appeals had in fact decided the case on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.496" offset="4603897">But in any event, as we point out, the constitutional argument is in essence the same argument that was made before, simply new labels being attached to old argument, and the policies in Hibi about why a court should not on that occasion 20 years later now 40 years later ignore the public policy of a cutoff apply equally well whether you label the claim equitable estoppel, equitable relief, or due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.265" offset="4726986">And in fact numerous of this Court's decisions dealing with equitable estoppel would confirm that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.430" offset="4755616">For example, in Immigration and Naturalization Service versus Miranda, where the Court held that the government was not equitably estopped because of its delay in processing an application for adjustment of status, it would be rather odd if the alien in that case could come back in and say that that delay violated his constitutional rights and he is therefore entitled to adjustment of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.805" offset="4845164">Based on the same allegation, the same thing would be true in Schleicker versus Hansen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.990" offset="4869928">The erroneous advice leading an individual not to get benefits for a period of time, the Court held there was no equitable estoppel there, it would be rather odd if the person could come right back in, put the label due process on, and suddenly be eligible for all these... for all these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.093" offset="4938265">If I could, if there are no questions on the Hibi point, turn to the equitable issues, and it is important to emphasize in all of these statutes that I am discussing the reason we are discussing them is because this Court in numerous of its foreign affairs decisions has looked to the Congressional response, Congressional acquiescence in determining whether or not the Attorney General did something that violated the will of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.420" offset="5051636">And as we have pointed out, you have an array of statutes, most compellingly the '48 statute, which states in no uncertain terms that even individuals who had applied under the 1940 Act and who had their applications pending, that those applications were to be decided under the 1948 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.815" offset="5133138">Now, if Congress was willing to see individuals who had made timely applications have their rights or benefits, rather, dealt with under the '48 statute, it could not have intended that individuals such as those here would be eligible for citizenship 40 years later.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.687" offset="5264691">That is clear from the face of the 1948 Act, that individuals who had applied under Section 701 before the December 31st cutoff, those applications were to be treated not under the '40 Act but under the '48 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.828" offset="5321220">And our submission is that it is an a fortiori.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.559" offset="5332191">If individuals who had met the cutoff had their benefits cut off under the '40 Act, it could not be that individuals such as respondent who, Number One, didn't apply during the period, and Number Two, didn't even know about overseas naturalization, Congress could not have intended that those individuals be eligible 40 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.614" offset="5412335">It is important to emphasize we are dealing with what has now come to be called Category Two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.627" offset="5432397">These phrases were coined by a district judge in the '68 Philippinos case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.070" offset="5454235">Category Two are individuals who made no efforts whatsoever prior to the cutoff to obtain citizenship, and in fact it is clear from the record in this case that not a single one of the 16 respondents even knew about the program, and in fact one of our submissions here in this Court is, it is difficult to understand how the respondents can claim they were injured when they didn't even know about the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.296" offset="5551097">Had there been an examiner there, we do not understand how they can claim injury when they did not even know about the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.521" offset="5584012">The subsequent statutes are as clear as the 1948 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.326" offset="5611179">The '52 Act specifically lists the territories that are included within the concept of the United States and its territories, and it excludes the Philippine islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.174" offset="5658617">So once again, and again, just like the '48 statute, that applies to applications that were pending under the 1948 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.902" offset="5693517">Congress explicitly stated in the '52 statute that applications under the '40 Act that were pending but had not been ruled upon were to be decided under the '52 statute, and again you have the same a fortiori.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.023" offset="5750046">If the pending applications were to be treated under the '52 Act, it could not be the case that Congress anticipated applications that had not even been filed until decades later should be treated under the '40 Act rather than the '52 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.543" offset="5812113">And then perhaps the most compelling statute of all in some sense because it is in essence an overall umbrella of these other statutes is the 1961 statute, where Congress said that all applications for naturalization have to be considered under the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.569" offset="5892152">That was Section 310(e) of the '52 Act in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.331" offset="5911274">So, the Court of Appeals in order to order equitable relief in this case not only had to ignore the 1940 Act, the '46 cutoff, but it had to ignore all of these other statutes as well, and we share the concern of the dissenting judges below that there is something wrong if a court just by putting on a hat that says equity can order a remedy that violates a whole series of statutes that could not be more explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.570" offset="6032168">Let me turn to the issue now of whether in fact the Attorney General violated the 1940 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.947" offset="6073755">The Ninth Circuit had little problem concluding there was such a violation, but as the dissenting judges noted and as the Court in Olegario noted, the statute gave the Attorney General considerable discretion in deciding where to place the examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.128" offset="6146480">There is nothing in the statute that said examiners had to be placed at specific locations for specific periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.945" offset="6177723">You then have the added layer of the foreign policy decision that was involved here, and the contemporaneous historical documents are quite clear as to what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.914" offset="6221608">The Attorney General initially made a decision even though the statute did not require it after consultation with his subordinates that he would apply the statute in the Philippines under a generous and reasonable interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.065" offset="6278137">It was only when the foreign policy issue arose that the decision was made to revoke the examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.998" offset="6301961">There is a document which is quoted in a number of the court decisions in this area from September 1945 to Attorney General Tom Clark indicating that the Philippine government had expressed its concern that if the naturalization program were carried out, as many as a quarter of a million people the best young men for the Philippines, would suddenly leave that newly emerging country for the United States, and you would have a country that would not have a nucleus of its own, an army of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.590" offset="6432260">And it was only upon obtaining this memorandum that the Attorney General initialed the memorandum and made the decision that he would revoke the naturalization authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.248" offset="6482937">After Congress made clear that being in the Commonwealth Army did not qualify an individual for the benefits of being in the United States armed forces, the Attorney General again reinstituted the authority of the naturalization examiner in the Philippines, because at that point since it was then being applied to members of the Scouts rather than the Commonwealth, which was a much smaller number, the concerns that had initially been raised by the Philippine government were no longer a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.531" offset="6608012">So we would urge the Court then to follow the reasoning of the decision in Olegario and to hold that the Attorney General's conduct was permissible under the '40 Act, and if I could just briefly touch upon the Court's Miranda decision, since that was relied upon quite heavily by the Court of Appeals, we strongly agree with the dissenting judges below that the Court could not have intended in a decision that did not raise any question involving Philippine veterans to in effect decide that citizenship was now going to be available for thousands of Philippine veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.595" offset="6760253">It was simply not an issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.248" offset="6766941">And we would urge the Court that, but we have offered an explanation of the language in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.833" offset="6793272">The Court in Miranda in saying that the action was error was referring not only to Hibi but also to the Court's Montana decision, and a reading of the Montana decision leaves grave doubt as to whether or not there was any error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.393" offset="6855443">That was a situation the Court may recall where a consular official indicated to a woman that she should not travel in her condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.681" offset="6888671">She was pregnant at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.942" offset="6897657">And there was a question of whether or not that was inappropriate advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.963" offset="6909778">But it is anything but clear, as the Court itself indicated in Miranda, whether this was error or was simply well-intended advice that she shouldn't travel in that condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.220" offset="6946767">So Montana itself confirms that the Court did not mean to necessarily declare that there was error, and we would submit that the point being made in Miranda was simply to emphasize that in Miranda you simply had delay or negligence whereas there were deliberate acts involved in Hibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.532" offset="7020015">So we don't think this Court intended in a context where the issue is not even before it to resolve these difficult questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.648" offset="7056482">Finally, I would not briefly one of our submissions that in this kind of situation where you are awarding equitable relief the Court of Appeals seemed to believe that once it had decided there was a wrong it had to find a remedy, and we submit that that is simply an erroneous understanding of the role of an equitable court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.306" offset="7155120">A court in effect has to balance the equities, and one thing that could not be stronger against the position of the respondents is that they did not assert their claimed entitlement to citizenship until 40 years later, or 30 years later at the least.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.638" offset="7220426">And as we have explained, individuals who knew about the program back in the 1940s are guilty of laches for waiting so long, and the individuals who did not even learn about the program until the 1970s or '80s can hardly claim that they were prejudiced or injured as a result of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.572" offset="7292211">In fact, we have cited some Law Review articles that analyze this Court's Hibi decision as at bottom a balancing of the equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.448" offset="7327737">But the Court of Appeals apparently was of the view that once it decided there was a wrong it didn't have to balance the equities, so we would urge the Court if it reaches that issue, and we submit there is no reason to get to the issue of remedies, but if the Court reaches that issue, we urge the Court to hold that at this late date, given the potential disruption of the immigration system, the delay in asserting the claimed of citizenship, and so forth, that there is no basis for equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.259" offset="7450931">I would reserve the balance for rebuttal, unless there are any questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.904" offset="7521566">The first of these is to tell the government you really meant it when you said the Attorney General's error was clear when he made it impossible for qualified World War Two veterans to be naturalized in the Philippines in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.911" offset="7581543">The second is to take a closer look at just what the error was, and to recognize that it was more than the ordinary neglect or oversight that the majority opinion described it as in the Hibi case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.960" offset="7633788">Rather, it was an intentional, deliberate decision by the Attorney General of the United States to keep the offer of citizenship away from qualified veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.808" offset="7673181">It was a decision, in other words, to prevent the enforcement of the law as Congress had written it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.888" offset="7729501">I think in Hibi the majority opinion looked at the facts in a more traditional equitable estoppel context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.853" offset="7757295">In a typical equitable estoppel argument against the government an applicant is suggesting that he was misled to his indetriment by some erroneous advice that a government official may have given him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.092" offset="7814242">Mr. Hibi couldn't make that kind of argument because there was no misleading of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.136" offset="7838483">No immigration officer or federal official went out to him and said to him erroneously that you are not eligible for naturalization, and so the court or the majority in that case seemed to conclude that because there was no affirmative act which misled Mr. Hibi, that there was no estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.669" offset="7908596">It could give rise to no estoppel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.847" offset="7941301">The majority characterized what happened as a mere failure to publicize the availability of this wartime naturalization law and a mere failure to station an examiner in the Philippines during all of the time that veterans like Mr. Hibi were eligible to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.849" offset="8005354">But it wasn't just a mere failure, and if the majority was saying a mere failure does not give rise to an estoppel, it certainly did not consider the issue of whether a deliberate decision to disregard the law would give rise to estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.939" offset="8061674">In that sense, I think you can look back at Hibi and come to a different conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2113.319" offset="8595198">The Solicitor General suggests that the Attorney General did have the authority to halt the naturalization program in the Philippines in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.256" offset="8634905">I think the place to start first of all is with the fact that what Congress had done here was to enact a statute in the exercise of its exclusive naturalization authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.865" offset="8681403">Congress and only Congress can determine who is to be naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.168" offset="8698643">That is not the function of the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.650" offset="8712541">And in this particular place, if we look at the language and the purpose of the statute and the means that Congress chose to implement that statute, it seems to me that it is quite clear that the Attorney General did have the obligation to carry out that law by naturalizing any qualified veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.783" offset="8781086">The language of the statute is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.384" offset="8795505">It says that any qualified veteran may be naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.027" offset="8810030">The purpose of the statute was to provide naturalization for qualified veterans in exchange for the service that they provided to the United States armed forces during the war.</text>

            <text syncTime="2201.841" offset="8949314">That is the mandate that Congress provided in the 1942 amendments to the 1940 Act, and I think it is clear from what happened that during the war itself, from 1942 onward throughout the war the Attorney General recognized that that was his obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2508.024" offset="10174039">I think it is important in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.496" offset="10183861">And also the due process argument is also important because of subsequent post-war legislation, because the Congress cannot legislate away, so to speak, a constitutional injury to these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.729" offset="10256795">So that would also be important for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.081" offset="10270274">Getting back to the issue of error, whether the Attorney General had the authority to withdraw the examiner from the Philippines during that time, the government says, first of all, that perhaps the Philippinos who were serving there were not entitled to naturalization in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.514" offset="10411963">I think what Mr. Klonoff is forgetting is that the Attorney General made that determination in 1945 that Philippinos, like these respondents, were eligible for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.063" offset="10454176">That is not really an issue before the Court any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.883" offset="10461491">They were determined to be within the scope of this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.726" offset="10476851">As to the foreign affairs authority, it is true that the executive department has great authority in the field of foreign affairs, but here we have a statute under which Congress, exercising its naturalization powers, said these people shall be naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.040" offset="10554069">There is no case which says that the executive branch can take action in the field of foreign affairs, despite an Act of Congress which provides an opposite intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.357" offset="10599313">I don't think the foreign affairs powers really goes that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.859" offset="10613314">As to the fact that Congress did not discuss specifically the issue of what it would want to do in the event of objections by the Philippines government as part of the foreign affairs issue, so to speak, it seems to me that it is hard to believe that Congress would have wanted to take away the offer of citizenship from Philippinos in the Philippines for such reasons, because when Congress enacted this law it made it specifically applicable to persons who were residing in the United States or its territories or possessions, and of course at that time the Philippines was the largest of the United States' possessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.294" offset="10823130">They used language in the law that a person who served in the armed forces and who was not a citizen, rather than using the term "alien" is significant that Congress meant to include Philippinos, because Philippinos were then by far the largest number of people who were neither citizens nor aliens, but non-citizen nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.014" offset="10893974">The use of that language certainly indicates an intent to include Philippinos who were residing in the Philippines within the scope of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.620" offset="10928351">As Justice Stevens has pointed out, this law was enacted at the very moment that the battles of Bataan and Coregedor were making headlines all across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.068" offset="10974222">Congress must have known that the Philippines was going to become independent at some future date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.762" offset="10997001">It must have known that President Roosevelt had brought all of these people into the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.385" offset="11015496">To suggest that Congress did not want these particular people to be naturalized seems to be inconsistent with all those particular ideas, and that if Congress really had wanted to exclude those Philippinos under these circumstances it would have made that intention explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.599" offset="11084354">It certainly didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.218" offset="11090833">I think I have touched on the idea already about whether the Attorney General had an implied delegation of authority to withhold the benefits of the naturalization law from people in the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.312" offset="11175156">Section 705, as I have indicated, did delegate a certain amount of authority to the Attorney General and the Commissioner of Immigration to place representatives in various parts of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.434" offset="11231685">As I pointed out before, there is a big difference between the authority to do that, the obvious discretion that he would have to have in light of scheduling and manpower problems and what was going on in the war, there is a big difference between that and deliberately removing an examiner who is already there for the purpose, the express purpose of taking away the offer of citizenship that Congress had made to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.610" offset="11328338">It seems to me if the Attorney General felt that there were reasons not to grant citizenship to Philippinos in the Philippines in 1945 it was for Congress to make that decision, because only Congress can determine who is to be naturalized, and that when the Attorney General made his decision, he really crossed the constitutional line between his role as a person who is supposed to faithfully execute the law with Congress's role to make the laws, particularly in the area of naturalization.</text>
