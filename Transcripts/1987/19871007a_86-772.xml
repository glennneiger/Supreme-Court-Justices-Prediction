            <text syncTime="15.135" offset="195283">This proceeding, brought under Section 1983, involves the imposition of municipal liability upon the Petitioner for the single isolated act of a city official who lacked general authority in the area and whose action was contrary to the policy of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.158" offset="267381">This is a Monell type case.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.016" offset="278770">In Monell, this Court indicated that it was going to leave to future decisions the full contours of municipal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.841" offset="314087">It is our position in respect to single incidents that this Court has shaped those contours in its decisions in cases such as Owens, Tuttle, and particularly the recent Pembaur decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.773" offset="381797">And what this proceeding calls for is an application of those principles to the facts herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.300" offset="407919">The facts are largely undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.050" offset="418891">The Plaintiff was a civil service employee of the City of St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.126" offset="435191">He was a planner for our community development commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.500" offset="448775">Around 1980, he became embroiled in a dispute with his supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.388" offset="468314">This led to a 15-day suspension for violation of the secondary employment rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.027" offset="494855">He appealed to our Civil Service Commission which reduced that to a reprimand.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.118" offset="515230">In April 1981, because of a change of administrations, the new mayor appointed a Defendant Frank Hamsher as the head of the community development agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.942" offset="558489">Approximately one year later, Mr. Hamsher, as director of that agency, transferred the Plaintiff to another City department.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.079" offset="595061">He filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.546" offset="608958">The Civil Service Commission declined that appeal on the basis that no injury was done to him at that time since this was a lateral transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.151" offset="647305">Subsequent to that, the Plaintiff filed a 1983 action naming three City officials and the City as Defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.476" offset="692654">Defendant Hamsher was one of those named.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.537" offset="708850">The Plaintiff was subsequently laid off from his position some 17 months after the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.829" offset="746048">He took an appeal from that layoff and that appeal has been deferred awaiting the outcome of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.778" offset="785859">We believe the question is whether or not the acts of the Defendant Hamsher in transferring the Plaintiff fall within the language of Monell which imposes liability for acts which can be said to fairly represent governmental policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.505" offset="864749">Now, the court below, the trial court rendered through a jury verdict a judgment against the City of St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.203" offset="907590">It exonerated the three individual defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.029" offset="926816">The Court of Appeals in its opinion determined that the jury had found that the act of transfer was a retaliatory act on the part of Defendant Hamsher and he was impermissibly motivated and caused constitutional injury to the Plaintiff who had been exercising his right of First Amendment by appealing to the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.783" offset="1033813">The Eighth Circuit determined that the Defendant Hamsher was a policy maker and his action, therefore, in transferring the Plaintiff bound the City of St. Louis so that Monell type liability was imposed upon the City as a policy maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.276" offset="1123883">It is our position that the crux of this matter involves the distinction between a City official who has the discretion to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.677" offset="1165470">In this case, the discretion to hire and fire and transfer employees as opposed to the authority of a policy maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.267" offset="1207789">In this case, it would be the authority to set employment policy for the City of St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.842" offset="1234120">Clearly, the Defendant Hamsher had the former: the discretionary power to hire, fire and transfer employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.027" offset="1262855">But nowhere in the record is there presented any evidence that the Defendant Hamsher was a policy maker for purposes of setting the employment policy of the City of St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.318" offset="1316040">The Court of appeals misconstrued Pembaur.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.239" offset="1331714">They adopted in their opinion what has been labeled the final authority test, which the court said was a two-pronged test to determine Monell liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="486.492" offset="2080696">The delegated authority to act, I think may be categorized as discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.726" offset="2101594">And this Court made clear in Pembaur in Part 2(b) that discretion is not enough to impose liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.878" offset="2138270">"The official must be responsible for establishing final government policy respecting such activity. "</text>
            <text syncTime="508.546" offset="2168886">Aside from the being contrary to Pembaur, the test promoted by the Eighth Circuit in its opinion is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.807" offset="2217996">The question of delegating out authority is one that runs throughout all of City officialdom in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.896" offset="2258329">We could not conduct business without delegating out discretion to employees all the way down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.315" offset="2288004">Also, the second part of the test, the lack of de novo review is equally unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.438" offset="2312455">There are countless decisions that are made everyday operationally that there is no apparatus to provide review.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.262" offset="2343802">As an example, the police officer in Tuttle who was involved in the shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.776" offset="2365849">There would have been nothing that would have provided reasonably any review for that act prior to what had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.382" offset="2404301">We believe the test is totally unreasonable, but the main point is that it is contrary to the opinions... most of the opinions that were rendered in Pembaur.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.252" offset="2451740">The plurality opinion I think clearly, which relies upon, as a basis the identification of a policy maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.248" offset="2491759">And the policy maker identification is arrived at by an inquiry into state law as to the authority of that official to set policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.415" offset="2536376">Here I believe you have a contrast in Pembaur between the official who was held liable and the Defendant Hamsher, who we assert should not have been considered to be a policy maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.004" offset="2586741">The prosecutor in Pembaur was an elected county-wide official.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.220" offset="2607639">The Sixth Circuit had held clearly interpreting Ohio law that he was the chief law enforcement officer for that particular county.</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.153" offset="6835296">There is a substantial difference between our version of the facts and the version of the facts as presented by counsel for Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.712" offset="6869568">I would like to point out that this was a jury tried case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.991" offset="6882734">And Respondent is entitled to the benefit of all evidence in his favor and all reasonable inference drawn therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.052" offset="6910946">Now, there are certain facts that are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.238" offset="6919723">It is stipulated that the acts against Praprotnik were done under color of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.985" offset="6942711">It was stipulated that he was engaged in protected activity at the time he appealed his actions to the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.484" offset="6976670">And there was evidence that he was also engaged in protected activity when he made some criticism of Seraph sculpture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.588" offset="7005092">A jury clearly found that Praprotnik had been subjected to retaliation because of his exercise of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.413" offset="7044380">Now, I want to get briefly into the facts where we are in difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.676" offset="7065487">For example, Petitioner argues that Hamsher was solely responsible for the transfer of Praprotnik from a secure position in the CDA to an insecure position at Heritage and Urban Design.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.311" offset="7124001">Now, let me explain that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.388" offset="7132256">Praprotnik had seniority position where he was the top seniority person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.932" offset="7154407">He had about 19 or 20 years of service at CDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.431" offset="7168409">There were three or four people in his same position underneath him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.633" offset="7185232">So that in order to reach Praprotnik, they would have had to lay off everybody underneath him in the same classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.365" offset="7212190">He was moved from that position to a position at Heritage and Urban Design where he was the only person in that classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.581" offset="7245105">Since we have departmental lay off, he was subject to immediate lay off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.626" offset="7261196">Now, in regard to the transfer, there are a few facts that led up to the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.013" offset="7286796">There had been the situation with the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.090" offset="7299126">There had been acts of retaliation against Mr. Praprotnik in terms of taking away his personnel, reducing his scope of his responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.509" offset="7328801">Things of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.601" offset="7333085">After that, he was subpoenaed to appear before the Heritage and Urban Design Commission to testify concerning the piece of sculpture, the Seraph sculpture which was ensconced on the front yard of the Civil Courts Building in the City of St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.205" offset="7395570">He testified and his testimony was not well received by the mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.251" offset="7411766">And he was immediately called into Mr. Hamsher's office and told that he should have mucked it, that he shouldn't have given this particular information to the Heritage and Urban Design Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.497" offset="7456696">Now, that was in the fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.041" offset="7462861">The following spring, he was transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.868" offset="7474251">Now, the act of transfer, in his particular situation, involved not only the transfer of the individual, but the transfer of functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.006" offset="7510718">In order to transfer functions, they had to get the approval of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, which consisted of the mayor, the president of the board of aldermen and the comptroller, the three highest elected officials of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.720" offset="7561604">They had to approve the transfer of functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3310.711" offset="13377611">And, so, we have statements by the employees, agents of the mayor, saying the mayor was unhappy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.410" offset="13400390">And I do not think that is hearsay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.032" offset="13430901">I think that our case should be affirmed for the reasons we have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.218" offset="13451590">That high public officials were involved, that the jury verdict under the Seventh Amendment should be respected and that the Court should grant the relief we have requested.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.306" offset="13511985">We have now in Respondent's argument interjected the mayor of the City of St. Louis into this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.834" offset="13542078">I would like to in reflecting the record try to clarify or correct what I think have been some mischaracterizations of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.611" offset="13573216">There was nothing in the record that indicates that the mayor ever had any personal involvement with the Plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.124" offset="13599234">I question whether or not he knew of the Plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.998" offset="13610727">The Plaintiff was a middle manager city planner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.669" offset="13625356">We were involved in a cutback of some community development funds that caused a shortfall of $35 million in the city budget and what was attempted to be done was to transfer functions from this large department, the Community Development Agency, to various other city agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.066" offset="13711038">The reference that the mayor knew of the transfer is actually a reference to his knowledge, obviously, that functions were being transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.704" offset="13745519">The Plaintiff attempted at various times to involve 15 City officials into this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.700" offset="13785539">His verdict director instruction, though, is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.995" offset="13802675">And I would read from it that: The Defendants Hamsher, Patterson and Kindleberger are high governmental officials with the right to make policy decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3426.616" offset="13841232">But, Mr. Wilson, as I understand it, you are relying on your motion for a directed verdict at the close of his case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3438.939" offset="13890447">Yes, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.625" offset="13897239">We are pointing out, though, his theory of the case in no way is directed to the mayor as a policy maker.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3445.982" offset="13918659">No, but at the directed verdict stage, you are not really debating the theory of the case of whether there is any evidence that would sustain liability under 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="3452.590" offset="13945095">I think, Justice Stevens, I think we get to the point of attempting to identify the policy maker and I think for that purpose we wanted to make sure that it was clear that the mayor, who may be, along with the Civil Service Commission, to be a policy maker, was not in any way involved in this particular retaliatory transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.472" offset="14024612">It was found by the Eighth Circuit to be the act of the Defendant Hamsher.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.876" offset="14046241">And I think that is the question is: Whether or not the Defendant Hamsher was a policy maker under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.482" offset="14072677">In respect to the appeal from the lay-off that Mr. Oldham described which I would have to disagree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.089" offset="14107054">I think the constructive discharge appeal would give the Plaintiff a right to a full hearing, either before the Civil Service Commission or under our state law, de novo in the Circuit Court.</text>
