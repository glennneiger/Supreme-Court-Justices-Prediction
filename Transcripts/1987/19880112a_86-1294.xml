            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="10.856" offset="171950">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.908" offset="184176">In this case, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency dismissed from his employment Doe, who had been employed in the Agency for some nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.918" offset="244257">At the time he was dismissed, he held a covert position as an electronics technician.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.004" offset="276545">In January of the year in which he was dismissed, he voluntarily informed security officials that he was a homosexual; and after considerable inquiry, negotiation and discussion, in May of that year he was informed that the Director of Central Intelligence had decided to terminate his employment pursuant to Section 102(C) of the Act, which speaks of termination with the Director deems that such action is necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.885" offset="460029">Doe brought suit, seeking reinstatement or reconsideration of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.408" offset="498167">The Court of Appeals held that there were no procedural defects in the procedures below, but did state that there was unclarity about the basis for the Director's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.219" offset="573400">It was possible, in the Court of Appeals' view, that Doe had been dismissed pursuant to a general policy of dismissing all homosexual employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.914" offset="636198">Again, they found further unclarity there.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.533" offset="654693">To the extent that such a policy dealt with employees who had engaged in homosexual activities, which Doe had stated he had since the year 1976, the Court of Appeals felt that the matter was foreclosed by Circuit precedent in the case of Dronenburg v. Zech.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.779" offset="735673">However, the Court of Appeals thought it possible that Doe had been dismissed on the basis of a general policy for dismissing all employees with a homosexual orientation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.622" offset="795023">And in that event, it became incumbent upon the Agency to explain, in the Court's words, "at the very least", why such a policy was necessary and advisable in the interest of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.084" offset="860851">The Court of Appeals concluded, of course, that, to the extent that these questions must be pursued in the District Court, that review was not precluded under the Administrative Procedure Act by Section 102(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="201.129" offset="933054">It has been our position in all courts and it is our position today that Section 102(C) of the National Security Act of 1947, which sets up the Central Intelligence Agency, precludes judicial review, under the APA, of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.876" offset="1012048">It is important at the outset I think to have a sense of the structure of the 1947 Act as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.248" offset="1057501">It is quite a short statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.933" offset="1064293">It is a statute which establishes the Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.051" offset="1080698">The first provision says there shall be a Central Intelligence Agency and a director and a deputy director, and then goes on to say what will happen if the director is a member of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.745" offset="1143496">The next section, which is Subsection (C), the one in question here, which is the very first substantive section of the Act, states that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 751, or the provisions of any other law, the Director of Central Intelligence may, in his discretion, terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the Agency whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.318" offset="1281841">That is the first substantive section of the Act setting up the Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.221" offset="1301380">The next section, the very next section, sets out the powers and duties of the director and the Agency, and that section contains the provision which was the subject of this Court's recent decision in CIA v. Sims.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.814" offset="1367836">It is that section which states that the Director of Central Intelligence shall be responsible for protecting intelligent sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.455" offset="1414334">In our view, these two sections are really flip sides of each other, that the general injunction upon the Director to protect the intelligence sources and methods of the United States implies, and then that it has set out the specific duty to protect the integrity and security of the CIA work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.705" offset="1527392">It seems to us, further, that the decision of this Court in CIA v. Sims, which dealt with the latter provision, sets the tone and sets the context for the consideration of the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.567" offset="1594788">In the Sims case, the Court of Appeals, the same Court of Appeals as decided this case, while recognizing the very special and delicate position of the Agency, went on to give that provision what this Court described as a "crabbed interpretation", an interpretation which would allow a considerable amount of what I would call rummaging around in the business of the Agency in litigation, through deposition, through discovery, through testimony, document production, and the like.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.609" offset="1746925">Mr. Fried, I am not sure that I know exactly how to interpret the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.596" offset="1778899">Do you think that Court opened it up for courts to determine in each instance under 102 whether the decision was in the interest of the United States?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="423.170" stopTime="460.844">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="423.170" offset="1821217">I think it certainly did.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.253" offset="1825501">What the Court said was that there was a possibility that the firing was on the basis of a general policy relating to employees with a homosexual orientation.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.865" offset="1891957">Therefore, it was open for District Court to inquire what the policy is.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.702" offset="1919333">And, Justice O'Connor, it is not sufficient, I suppose, once you get into litigation, for the Agency simply to say well, we have no such policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.042" offset="1952665">Because the litigant can say, yes, you do, and let's have a lawsuit about that.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="460.844" stopTime="471.052">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="460.844" offset="1971891">Is it open to the Director to protect himself from judicial inquiry by saying in effect that he intends to give no reason?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="471.052" stopTime="532.356">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="471.052" offset="2012747">The Court of Appeals, in one of the more mysterious aspects of its decision, said that if the Director intended to terminate the employment without giving a reason, that that would be all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.977" offset="2080456">But if, however, he was terminating the employment on the basis of this policy, that would trigger the responsibility of the Director to explain at the very least why his decision and that policy was necessary and advisable.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.725" offset="2163421">Therefore, it would seem to me that it is open to a persistent litigant in every case to say you, Director, did not intend to give reasons, but it seems to us that nonetheless, you acted under a general policy and now we think that policy is unconstitutional and you must at the very least explain why it is advisable.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="532.356" stopTime="541.029">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="532.356" offset="2257985">If it is correct that the Director intended to give no reason, do you support that aspect of the Court's opinion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="541.029" stopTime="605.572">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="541.029" offset="2292675">I would be very happy to rest content with that, except I don't know what it gives me.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.402" offset="2326112">I am afraid that I am buying an empty bag there, because the Court of Appeals, while it acknowledge that possibility, I don't think would have been content with a simple statement that that is what we intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.114" offset="2396956">Indeed, it is a little hard to know how the Director could have more clearly indicated that he was not putting forward reasons, and inviting inquiry into the basis of his action, because what he stated was that he is terminating the employment because he deems it necessary and advisable.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.860" offset="2480025">Now, that seems to me to be about as good a way as any to say I don't want to give any further reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.431" offset="2510223">And yet, the Court of appeals said well, let's rummage around a little bit more to see what we come up with.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.453" offset="2542301">And that is what I think is intolerable.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.572" offset="2550869">Do you think that the Congress intended to preclude litigation of even Constitutional claims with 102?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="615.594" offset="2590889">Yes, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.260" offset="2593606">that has been our position right along and that is certainly our position here today.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="622.164" stopTime="754.215">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="622.164" offset="2617220">Even if were for example a policy not to hire a black or a woman or something of that kind?</text>
            <text syncTime="629.568" offset="2646791">Justice O'Connor, if the policy related to hiring or promotion, Congress has subjected the CIA, in 72, to Title VII, so that we would not that.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.993" offset="2700499">I think what we are talking about is termination of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.695" offset="2719307">And termination of employment is a very special matter, because if you are an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, you have access to the most sensitive intelligence information which this country possesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.591" offset="2790883">And the only way to remove that access is to terminate the employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.930" offset="2820244">I think that is why such a special emphasis is given to the issue of termination of employment and why it, in the Congressional scheme, this is a Congressional scheme, it stands on a different footing from the initial employment decision or even promotion decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.093" offset="2900910">The Central Intelligence Agency is subject to Title VII and in fact welcomes the procedures that are involved because it considers that those procedures in their invocation which involve a considerable amount of internal review, maintains the kind of morale inside the Agency which they are very anxious to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.291" offset="3005714">But there does come a point where the Agency simply must be able, without giving reasons and without triggering the kind of inquiry, narrow as the Court said it was, but wide as we think it is, without triggering the kind of inquiry in open court.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.420" offset="3070184">Why would a Title VII promotion suit involve any less rummaging around?</text>
            <text syncTime="745.942" offset="3112293">I mean, one agent says I've done a better job on my covert assignments, and I can prove it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="754.215" offset="3145416">There are a number of very important reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.285" offset="3161717">There is confession and there is avoidance, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.951" offset="3172375">Certainly what is involved in Title VII is a requirement to go to the Agency and to pursue internal remedies there.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.443" offset="3218350">And the fact that there have been a handful, literally a handful... well, seven; I suppose that's a hand and part of a second hand... of those cases filed, since 1972, indicates that the internal procedures take care of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.173" offset="3293269">Now, you can have the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.392" offset="3306122">The important thing is that that lawsuit itself might be trumped by 102(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="802.980" offset="3340499">And it is important to keep that possibility open.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.051" offset="3368711">I thought you were saying 102(C) does not prevent the Title VII lawsuits for promotion but it does prevent this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.930" offset="6548231">Our point is really quite a simple one, that at different times, different language is used to accomplish this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.834" offset="6579891">In 1978, the Congress said that the President may detain or remove hostile aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.289" offset="6613642">And in the first case under the APA the Ludecke case, this Court said that was sufficient to preclude APA review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.045" offset="6648750">In 1947, the language was "in his discretion".</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.949" offset="6668290">In 1964, in the Act setting up the National Security Agency, the language is</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.555" offset="6702771">"in his discretion, and it is final. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.357" offset="6713952">In 1984, in the statute setting up the Defense Intelligence Agency, the language was</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.244" offset="6741537">"final and shall not be appealed outside the Department of Defense. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.731" offset="6763480">To our minds, the language changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.182" offset="6777273">The thought is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.801" offset="6783751">The boilerplate gets thicker, but it seems quite clear that in 1798, in 1947, in 1964, in 1984, Congress was seeking to accomplish the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.644" offset="6843101">If that is not so, then we have the anomaly, an anomaly which Congress clearly stated in various reports, it did not imagine it was facing, that the Secretary of Defense, in respect to the Defense Intelligence Agency, or the National Security Agency, has this unreviewable power, but the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.926" offset="6948218">It seems to us that that is not a sensible scheme, and it is not the scheme which Congress imagined it was enacting.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark H. Lynch</label>
            <text syncTime="1720.655" offset="7011121">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.761" offset="7051558">The only claim that Mr. Doe has that survives the Court of Appeals Opinion is the decisions of the Court of Appeals that he has an arguable Constitutional claim, if in fact the Agency has a policy of discharging people on the basis of homosexual orientation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.622" offset="7119059">So the question then is whether Section 102(C) of the National Security Act of 1947 precludes judicial review of that Constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.978" offset="7156466">Now, whether or not the Government conceded that there could be review of Constitutional claims, I think they did in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.434" offset="7190321">It is less clear in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.369" offset="7198053">But whether they conceded it or not, it is absolutely clear that that issue was not litigated, because as the case progressed to the District Court, and in the Court of Appeals, the question was whether the Agency had followed its regulations, not whether it had violated a substantive Constitutional prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.461" offset="7266389">So consequently, the question of whether the statute precludes judicial review of a Constitutional claim was not litigated below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.603" offset="7302961">At the least, we think the Court ought to remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.055" offset="7320724">If it thinks that the statute does preclude review, at the least it ought to remand the case for ventilation of the question of whether Congress can constitutionally preclude review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.761" offset="7359594">However, we also submit that the statute does not preclude review of Constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.998" offset="7384567">The statute on its face says nothing about judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.302" offset="7397733">The legislative history says nothing about judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.420" offset="7410167">What the statute does say is that notwithstanding the provisions of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act or any other statute, the Director, in his discretion, may terminate Agency employees when he deems it necessary and advisable for the United States to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.161" offset="7465129">Now given the fact that there was not judicial review of termination decisions in 1947, the most plausible explanation of that language was that Congress was intending to keep CIA employees who had been terminated out of the Civil Service Commission, where they were entitled to go under the Veterans Preference Act which had been passed in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.796" offset="7567738">That seems to be a very plausible, rational Congressional expectation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.782" offset="7587696">The CIA, after all, in the beginning, in 1947, was going to be heavily populated with Veterans in the Office of Strategic Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.869" offset="7616012">They were Veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.519" offset="7618625">Without this statute they would be able to go to the Civil Service Commission to contest the Director's termination decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.209" offset="7645374">And it is quite plausible that Congress would have wanted to prevent that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.244" offset="7657495">But, since there was not judicial review of any termination decisions at that point, it seems to me impossible to say that Congress intended to preclude review in 1947.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.776" offset="7871594">Our position is that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.026" offset="7876610">In fact, the Government's position, stated at Page 18 of their reply brief in the Court of Appeals, is that the statute does not preclude review of actions alleging that the Agency has failed to follow its regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.703" offset="7927392">They accept the rule of Service v. Dulles and Vitarelli v. Seaton, that they have to follow their own regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.440" offset="7954246">They also accept the fact that you get review of personnel decisions under Title VII, short of termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.129" offset="7985070">Mr. Fried does not really concede it but he suspects that if there were certain kinds of Constitutional claims, this Court would also grant review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.585" offset="8030837">I might also say that another provision of the National Security Act of 1947 which Mr. Fried neglected to discus is the CIA Information Act of 1984, which is an amendment to the National Security Act of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.011" offset="8088620">That statute, which was passed after the Sims decision, makes it very clear that the Agency is subject to judicial review under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.819" offset="8131774">So in many respects, the Agency is subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.289" offset="8149642">Now, in view of the lack of any textual support for preclusion, any legislative history support, what the Government is really arguing is that the Congress must have insulated this very sensitive Agency from judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.347" offset="8201887">But as I have just pointed out, in a number of other significant respects, the Agency clearly is subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.168" offset="8225188">So this "rummaging around" argument does not, with respect, hold water.</text>

            <text syncTime="2056.139" offset="8353083">Even if Section 102(C) met the standards of either Section 701(A)(1) or (A)(2), for preclusion, even if it did, and I do not think it did, but even if it did, that would not preclude, that would not resolve the question of whether a Constitutional claim is precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.517" offset="8426644">Because quite apart from the Administrative Procedure Act and the exemptions to the Administrative Procedure Act, people who are directly injured by the unconstitutional action of an Executive Agency officer can get review of that claim in the Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3117.156" offset="12597145">That is a statutory claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.607" offset="12606967">And of course, the difference between statutory and Constitutional claims is thereby pointed out because the Constitutional claim is simply the statutory claim with the addition of a citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.296" offset="12649704">There really is no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.265" offset="12661616">And I think we are not arguing about anything very much if we pretend that ends up making a large point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.806" offset="12703725">The reason we did not simply accept the remand is because we would have been required to do more than file a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.044" offset="12732669">That letter would have been the beginning of the litigation, and not its end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.131" offset="12749074">We would say there is no such policy.</text>
