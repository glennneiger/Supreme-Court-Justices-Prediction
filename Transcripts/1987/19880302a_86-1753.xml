            <text syncTime="1271.898" offset="5235081">That is, make it at the time it is signed not an acknowledgement of control of ready accounts, but what the Ranauro court said is that no matter how hypothetically it's drafted and vaguely it's drafted, the process server who went to the bank could then get on the stand,... the Brown decision in the Second Circuit says that you can authenticate and get admission of records by putting on the process server who served the subpoena and say this is what I asked for and here's what I got, and that's authentication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.830" offset="5362872">In this case, the process server could say or the Government attorney or an agent who delivered the consent could say, I went to the bank and demanded the records, they said no because the customer has to consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.620" offset="5422013">I went to the bank with Doe's consent, this is what they gave me.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.577" offset="5649801">--I would have to say that in our view, the traditional Fifth Amendment rule is that too much and communication are the same thing, that the Court has said too much in terms of production of physical evidence, giving blood samples, being forced to speak in your own voice in a line-up and repeat what was said, that's a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.002" offset="5743528">But the bright line the Court has drawn in case after case is, between physical evidence, acts that have no communicative content, and communication, and I think that in my view, too much and that line are the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.795" offset="5810715">Having already given the hypothetical... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.519" offset="5885634">I only ended up giving one of the explanations that the Government uses to show that this is a non-assertive two others that suggest two other categories of communications that it would view as unprotected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.968" offset="5947388">One is the Government argues in its brief that this is a non-assertive communication because the Government put the words in Doe's mouth, and the Court ordered him to say it, and, therefore, it wouldn't be right to treat them as words of Doe or as communications from Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.569" offset="6013843">Now, the Government is clearly trying to have it both ways there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.461" offset="6025337">It wants to take this document to the bank and say to the bank, this is Doe's consent, only he can give it, there's his signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.956" offset="6051355">On the other hand, it comes to this Court and says, you should treat it as an act devoid of content because we told him what to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.161" offset="6080194">If the Government's right there, then presumably unimmunized witnesses could be made to cooperate in an investigation so long as the Government told them what to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.997" offset="6123557">For example, if you imagine a complex conspiracy investigation in which, as is often true, the prosecutor knows what went on and knows who the players were, but can't because it doesn't have a cooperating witnesses establish these conspiratorial links that are necessary for the conspiracy indictment, it would theoretically under the Government's view be proper to have a court order an unimmunized alleged coconspirator to call up other parties and make statements calculated to cause t other parties to incriminate themselves and if that were to work, then the incriminating statements might equally well incriminate the person doing the calling out of his own mouth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.637" offset="6750078">The Cayman Islands have ruled, the high court of the Cayman Islands has ruled that a compelled consent is not a consent for purposes of its law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.763" offset="6782575">So, what the Government is trying to obtain is on its face an invalid document, and the Government has said we want to use that document nonetheless in a U.S. court in the balancing test in hopes that it will be thrown on our side of the scale, notwithstanding its patent invalidity in the Cayman Islands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.788" offset="6938682">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.011" offset="6951535">I think it's helpful at the outset to make clear exactly what is not controverted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.124" offset="6972015">Both sides agree that the bank records sought by the Government are not themselves privileged under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.457" offset="6993330">Both sides agree that the banks that hold the documents can't assert the Fifth Amendment in declining to turn them over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.821" offset="7018826">Both sides agree that the Petitioner has no Fifth Amendment right to keep the banks from disclosing the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.248" offset="7040560">Both sides agree the Government has to find the banks where Petitioner has his accounts through its own investigation and once the Government does find those accounts, both sides agree that the only thing that will keep the banks from surrendering the account records are foreign bank secrecy bank laws that have no force in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.989" offset="7103463">I think Mr. Timbie acknowledged all these points in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.521" offset="7117569">Nonetheless, Petitioner insists that the Fifth Amendment somehow gives him a constitutional right to continue to enjoy the protection of the foreign bank secrecy laws, even though the act of waiving that protection, the consent form itself, concededly does not give the Government any information that will advance its investigation.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1761.823" offset="7194787">It really doesn't waive the protection as was just pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.906" offset="7211192">I mean, and even if the amicus brief had not been filed, it's obviously the simplest thing in the world for any foreign country who has these bank laws and, indeed, it would be idiotic if they didn't, once this case is decided the way you want it decided, for them to simply say, moreover, compelled consent is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.499" offset="7293530">That will be in the bank contract and then you can do these proceedings forever and it will never get you the information you want.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="1792.824" offset="7318816">Well, let me say several things in response to that, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.816" offset="7330833">Idiotic or not, the fact does have some effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.338" offset="7340864">It is true that a court in the Cayman Islands has concluded that as a matter of Cayman laws, these consent forms are in effect if that decision was not appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.734" offset="7370434">So, Cayman law, I think, is not settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.624" offset="7378062">But there are other jurisdictions that have, even assuming that that settles Cayman law for all time, there are other jurisdictions that have bank secrecy provisions either by statute or by common law, including Bermuda and the United Kingdom, Bermuda is involved in this case, and my understanding is although there are no reported cases from those jurisdictions, in fact, banks in those jurisdictions comply with these compel consents because they interpret their common law bank secrecy protections as having an exception for when compel consent forms of this kind are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.344" offset="7492896">So, I think that they are useful and, of course, there are a great many other jurisdictions that have widely varying kinds of bank secrecy laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.080" offset="7519855">So, this is not a sham proceeding, and I should say, in addition, to the extent that a consent form won't be useful for us, that's our problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.125" offset="7548067">That is not a solution to the Petitioner's case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.368" offset="7561024">It doesn't have any bearing on the Fifth Amendment question of whether it can be compelled to execute the consent, which we can then try to use in a foreign jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.872" offset="7587041">So, I think it is extremely useful proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.045" offset="7599685">I should add one additional practical point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.767" offset="7606581">To the extent that Mr. Timbie suggested that we can simply obtain these records easily enough by serving subpoenas on the domestic branches of foreign banks, that's not entirely true because those banks can contests subpoenas and argue that under comity principles, they should not be required to surrender the records, and I'm sure that the banks, and Mr. Timbie if he were in a position to do so, would argue that they should not surrender those records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.611" offset="7698010">So far as banks that don't have branches in the United States are concerned, in which you must attempt to obtain records by going to foreign nations, under comity principles, foreign courts are often reluctant to help other countries enforce their revenue laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.543" offset="7761748">So, these consent forms may be the only way for us to obtain this information.</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.890" offset="13919123">The Government obtains bank records, uses them against the Petitioner, it will not relieve its burden of establishing its own case because he has spoken his guilt in some sense because he hasn't said anything about his guilt or about what went on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.190" offset="13972308">It would not be a situation in the language by the Court thirty years ago in its Ullmann decision in which the accused was convicted because of disclosures from his own mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.706" offset="14010343">He hasn't made any disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.128" offset="14015985">All he has done is permit the Government to obtain evidence from a third party and to return to Justice Stevens'... one of the many hypotheticals Justice Stevens' safe deposit hypothetical, it's simply a situation similar to the one that would be presented if a suspect required not to lock his safe deposit box, so that people could get into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.420" offset="14089233">This is simply permitting the Government to obtain evidence that can be used against him at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.181" offset="14108250">The evidence that will be provided by third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.684" offset="14122251">Now, there's nothing in the language, certainly in the purposes of the Fifth Amendment, or in any of this Court's decision as Petitioner concedes that requires the Court to rule for him in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.661" offset="14166137">The Court of Appeals recognized that and we think this Court should affirm its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.915" offset="14183169">If there are no further questions, thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3518.993" offset="14223502">Mr. Rothfeld took issue with our waiver of the attorney-client privilege hypothetical, saying that, of course, the attorney-client privilege is self-policing because any lawyer in his right mind isn't going to accept the compelled consent directive as a valid waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.576" offset="14297794">But the Government offers a broader rational here, even in the waiver area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.148" offset="14316080">What it is saying there is that it can force an unwilling, unimmunized witness to sign any waiver that would merely be... would allow it to overcome a non-constitutional impediment to access the third party records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.331" offset="14388805">There are other statutory privileges that this procedure could be used for that would not give rise to self-policing mechanisms through--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3568.388" offset="14421092">Immunity wouldn't be any... you wouldn't say if the Government were to compel him to consent to a waiver of his attorney-client privilege, that would be all right if he were immunized?</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.663" offset="14462157">I mean, that is bad, but for a reason quite apart from the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3583.307" offset="14480756">--I wholeheartedly agree, but what the Government is saying in this case is that you shouldn't look at this through a Fifth Amendment lens because it will be policed elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.322" offset="14520775">What we're saying is the Government shouldn't be able to give it a try by forcing you to sign that document.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.317" offset="14544808">Think of, for example, a state evidentiary privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.940" offset="14559332">The accountant-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.860" offset="14566960">Spousal privilege, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.853" offset="14578976">It may well be the Government could get a consent directive, get a spouse or accountant to go into a Grand Jury and talk to the police, never introduce the testimony in evidence, so there would never be a suppression hearing, but use the fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.422" offset="14625265">We contend that the only way to police that is with the Fifth Amendment, not with some Fourth Amendment notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.735" offset="14646477">Getting back to Justice O'Connor's question, she asked the Government whether they felt they could use this document in evidence, and the Government said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.242" offset="14692452">No Fifth Amendment problem, and we don't... but we wouldn't try.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.675" offset="14706245">We state that that is constructive use immunity which is not allowed in this Court.</text>
