            <label>Mr. David I. Bruck</label>
            <text syncTime="56.587" offset="359636">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.289" offset="374369">The question in this case is whether a State in a refusal to give retroactive effect to this Court's decision in Francis v. Franklin to cases which were final on direct appeal when Francis was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.814" offset="436540">As in any retroactivity case, I think it may be helpful to review a little of the procedural history that got us to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.320" offset="466529">Petitioner Dale Yates was tried and convicted of murder in 1981, two years after this Court's decision in Sandstrom v. Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.676" offset="508011">His appeal was decided in late 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.664" offset="523894">No objection was raised at trial or on appeal to the unconstitutional jury instruction which is at the core of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.269" offset="558375">However, that creates no procedural bar under South Carolina law under a very very well established line of South Carolina cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.291" offset="598395">Indeed, in his direct appeal opinion, the Court said that it reviewed the entire record of Mr. Yates' trial in favorem vitae as is South Carolina Supreme Court's invariable practice in capital cases alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.050" offset="653461">It has a rather strict procedural default rule in non-capital cases, but it has no such rule in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.955" offset="681047">And the Court said that it found no prejudicial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.876" offset="704766">A year, a little less than a year later, the South Carolina Supreme Court, for the first time, sustained a Sandstrom challenge to a series of burden shifting jury instructions involving the essential element of malice, which is an essential element of murder under South Carolina law.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.772" offset="784387">The first of those decisions in 1983 was a case called State v. Elmore.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.360" offset="814689">A few months after Elmore, Yates filed a habeas corpus petition in the original jurisdiction of the State Supreme Court alleging that the jury instructions in his case which I think we all agree were materially identical to those involved in Elmore, created... and I quote...</text>
            <text syncTime="190.923" offset="896922">"an unconstitutional burden shifting presumption of malice. "</text>
            <text syncTime="194.993" offset="913223">He alleged that it created a mandatory rebuttable presumption of malice, and he cited Sandstrom v. Montana as authority for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.366" offset="954705">He also said that in light of Elmore and another case, State v. Woods that had also applied Sandstrom to strike down the same instructions, the South Carolina Supreme Court should apply its own decisions and uphold his constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.661" offset="1027953">While this petition... the State responded, by the way, to this original petition by saying that they agreed that his petition should be consolidated with another appeal then before the State Supreme Court to resolve the apparent issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.170" offset="1081974">The court... however, the respondent, the State of South Carolina, argued on the merits of the constitutional claim that in fact it was not a bad jury instruction, and presented exclusively Federal authority saying that the instruction could be distinguished from that involved in Sandstrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.247" offset="1146235">While his petition was pending, this Court decided Francis v. Franklin.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.401" offset="1162849">Yates submitted the Francis decision to the State Supreme Court and said that Francis was absolutely on all fours, and required reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.023" offset="1197331">The court... about three weeks after it got the Francis decision, the State Court said that it had in a per curiam decision without opinion said that it had considered the petition for habeas corpus and concluded that it should be denied.</text>

            <label>Justice Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="283.033" offset="1265353">It did not cite Francis?</text>

          <turn speaker="david_i_bruck" startTime="284.901" stopTime="400.443">
            <label>Mr. David I. Bruck</label>
            <text syncTime="284.901" offset="1272877">It cited nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.851" offset="1276638">What I recited is exactly the words that the State Court used.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.221" offset="1302134">Yates then petitioned this Court for certiorari and this Court granted certiorari and remanded to the South Carolina Supreme Court for reconsideration in light of Francis v. Franklin.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.546" offset="1347482">On remand, the judgement occurred which is the subject of this matter here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.885" offset="1376844">The State Supreme Court's opinion on remand begins by acknowledging in the first breath that the constitutional error involved here is a violation of Francis v. Franklin.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.443" offset="1431074">The way the Court put it was that the instructions here violated the principals of State v. Elmore, and involved the same infirmities as those addressed by the United States Supreme Court in Francis.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.500" offset="1475273">But immediately after saying that, the State Supreme Court then said, so the question before us is the retroactivity of State v. Elmore, completely ignoring the fact that it had just finished conceding, or acknowledging that this was a Federal Constitutional error that had been committed in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.331" offset="1554581">The Court then said that retroactivity... taking a couple of lines out of this Court's retroactivity doctrine which the State Court apparently misinterpreted to mean that the retroactivity of constitutional decisions is entirely a matter of State law, and then proceeded to say that they found the view expressed by Justice Harlan in Desist and Mackey to be persuasive, and therefore the Court would, as a matter of its own State law, not apply the doctrine condemning mandatory rebuttable presumptions, an essential element of the offense.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="400.443" offset="1735035">Well, Mr. Bruck, if the South Carolina Supreme Court does not discriminate against Federal claims, does this Court have authority to tell that Court what retroactivity law to apply in a State habeas proceeding to you suppose?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_i_bruck" startTime="421.023" stopTime="563.882">
            <label>Mr. David I. Bruck</label>
            <text syncTime="421.023" offset="1817373">The difficulty is that the claim is a Federal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.558" offset="1831479">I think the answer is, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.860" offset="1844749">The retroactivity of Federal Constitutional decisions is a matter of Federal constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.283" offset="1874424">And the State Court, in effect, was discriminating against that whole body of this Court's constitutional doctrine, when it said that we are simply not going to apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.757" offset="1920295">The crucial thing to stress here is that this is not... no matter how much the State attempts now to recast this matter... is not a case involving a State's construction of its own post-conviction remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.981" offset="1973167">That is not what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.283" offset="1978392">It would not have made a nickel's worth of difference whether Dale Yates had raised his claim on direct appeal, had raised it at trial, had raised it all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.104" offset="2009634">If the State Court had denied relief prior to its own final rather belated acknowledgment of the principles of Sandstrom in the Elmore decision, they would have come up with exactly the same decision if Yates had then later renewed his claim after he noticed that the State Supreme Court had begun to apply Sandstrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.001" offset="2085285">And I think the proof of that is in another line of South Carolina retroactivity decisions led by Truesdale v. Aiken, a case involving what the South Carolina Supreme Court believed to be a question involving the retroactivity of this Court's decision in Skipper v. South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.795" offset="2156442">And in Truesdale, the petitioner in Truesdale had raised his Skipper claim well before Skipper on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.032" offset="2181415">He met... it met with no success.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.067" offset="2193536">He then raised it again on post-conviction relief and the State Court came up with a decision very very similar... a little short of it, but essentially the same decision as is involved in this case, saying that they again have decided to apply Skipper only on direct appeal and that they're adopting in effect the Justice Harlan view in collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.564" offset="2283502">This Court summarily reversed, I think correctly, I believe, recognizing that the retroactivity, as I say, of a Federal constitutional decision is not a matter that States have the authority to pick and choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.359" offset="2346718">So we don't say that there's any discrimination between one sort of Federal claim and another, but simply that South Carolina has misinterpreted the Federal nature of the constitutional law.</text>

            <text syncTime="759.569" offset="3171561">The South Carolina Supreme Court was instructed to reconsider this case in light of Francis v. Franklin.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.307" offset="3198519">And of course, there is absolutely no state procedural doctrine in South Carolina whatsoever that shuts the door on one procedural category of claims and not on others.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.964" offset="3249092">I realize the State has tried to identify some defect in the initial habeas proceeding papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.886" offset="3280753">I don't know that that really needs to be responded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.172" offset="3293918">Perhaps, if need be if that claim is renewed today, I may touch on it in reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.409" offset="3314921">But suffice it to say that I think the basic error that the State Court committed when they got this case on remand was their failure to recognize that there is a threshold test in any retroactivity case that must be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.038" offset="3381376">And that is whether or not you are dealing with a new decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.438" offset="3390989">And I don't think there are very many cases in which this Court more clearly indicated... and I realize there was disagreement within the Court... but the majority of the opinion of the Court clearly held that Francis v. Franklin simply applied one of the alternate holdings of Sandstrom v. Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.384" offset="3470820">Some of the proof of how not new a decision in Francis was is that South Carolina had in other contexts, and with other instructions, already applied this very portion of Sandstrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.211" offset="3522124">And indeed, State against Elmore was an application of the principles of Francis before Francis was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.780" offset="3548351">Everything they needed to have applied Francis they could have gotten, and did get out of Sandstrom v. Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.118" offset="3577713">So where a retroactivity issue came from in this case is something which I'm still struggling from the State's opinion to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.813" offset="3640511">The... of course, when we apply the Stovall factors, assuming that the Court is not inclined to use this case to reconsider the viability of the Stovall retroactivity doctrine, it's rather clear that this Francis v. Franklin or Sandstrom v. Montana, whatever principles one wishes to label them as, follow very clearly on the retroactive application side of the Stovall factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.380" offset="3754823">First and foremost, we consider the purpose of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.332" offset="3766630">And the purpose of this rule is to insure that the State bears its burden of proof and that only the guilty are convicted and the innocent are acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.938" offset="3804978">That is at the very heart of the truth seeking function in criminal trials, as this Court very clearly stressed in Francis.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.579" offset="3843535">At that point, the second two factors under this Court's cases really fall out of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.817" offset="3864537">But even if we look at them, justifiable reliance on the old rule, after Sandstrom v. Montana, and really after Mullaney v. Wilbur in 1975, there could have been no justifiable reliance on any notion that States were entitled to shift the burden of persuasion on an essential element of an offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="960.714" offset="3976132">In fact, it cut back rather sharply on Mullaney.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.687" offset="4008002">But Patterson nevertheless it used an analysis of the elements test.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.056" offset="4025451">It focused on what the elements of the crime were.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.690" offset="4036005">And here, certainly malice is an element of murder and no one could have read Patterson to think that it is justifiable to shift the burden of persuasion on the element of malice under South Carolina law.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.865" offset="4080727">In any event, Sandstrom v. Montana which followed Patterson could not really have been much clearer on this point, although the instructions are probably most easily read in Sandstrom as a conclusive presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.025" offset="4137360">That issue was in doubt, and the Court said whether it be conclusive of whether it be mandatorily rebuttable, it is no less unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.345" offset="4166617">That was two years before this person's trial, three years before his direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.833" offset="4180619">And there could not be any conceivable justifiable reliance on any prior rule, State or Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.919" offset="4212906">Finally, we have impact on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.021" offset="4225340">The impact in this case is truly negligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.342" offset="4238611">South Carolina naturally is concerned about applying rules to cases which are already final, but I would stress that South Carolina has an extremely rigid system of procedural default in all but capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.000" offset="4293259">So that anyone who didn't raise this and properly litigate it both at trial and on direct appeal, there is no interest of justice exception, there is no fundamental error exception under 9 Capital South Carolina criminal law so there are very very few cases in the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.260" offset="4354281">And in any event, there is no right for South Carolina now to be able to claim that that's a valid factor to consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="1127.374" offset="4642777">The petitioner did ask the State Supreme Court to apply the state decisions applying Sandstrom retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.628" offset="4671721">We thought it simply the most tactful way of putting the matter, but we also made clear the Federal constitutional character of the claim in the habeas papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.050" offset="4705471">But I confess to complete bewilderment as to how this case became a retroactivity case when there is new law to be applied by the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.941" offset="4753014">Clearly, what has somehow happened in this case is that we have a State Supreme Court which simply has denied that the retroactivity or that the obligation... whether you call it retroactivity or not... the obligation of a State court to apply Federal law in its courts, whether it be civil, criminal, post-conviction, or direct appeal, is a matter of Federal, not State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.258" offset="4858340">And that's where we got off onto this... South Carolina Supreme Court on remand... onto this tangent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.114" offset="4897732">The State argues beyond the retroactivity issue, the State puts a great deal of effort in their brief to argue that in fact this isn't such a bad instruction and that it is not an unconstitutional instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.576" offset="4959590">This is a claim which it has pressed over and over again without success.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.612" offset="4971711">In the South Carolina Supreme Court it has recently been rejected by the Fourth Circuit in Hyman v. Aiken, a Federal habeas case from which the State has not sought review in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.483" offset="5015179">It is really a matter which is all but settled, and for the reasons set forth in our brief, I would suggest that the South Carolina Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit have correctly identified the constitutional infirmity of both of the malice instructions at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.778" offset="5096367">And don't really feel that the State's position has any merit on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.050" offset="5121445">They also argue that this Court ought to make the first determination of whether the error was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.102" offset="5137641">I've argued at some length in the Reply Brief that in view of both of the two theories of prosecution that were used in this case and applying South Carolina law and the particular form of the law of parties in accomplice liability under South Carolina law, that the States harmless error argument has no merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.618" offset="5227711">I would simply stress here that this again was pressed vigorously before the South Carolina Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.188" offset="5254042">The South Carolina Supreme Court did not expressly reject the harmless error argument, but I should think that if under South Carolina law and under the facts of this case, the South Carolina Court had seen merit in the harmless error argument, it is most unlikely that they would have gone off into the area of retroactivity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1315.628" offset="5395731">I really think that is certainly what this Court's precedents envision I think in almost every situation, even the very case in which you held that there could be harmless error under Francis v. Franklin, you then remanded to the Federal Court in habeas to allow that determination to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.922" offset="5472949">And that certainly would seem to be the most reasonable way to proceed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.660" offset="5491861">I think South Carolina when the case is remanded will grant this person a new trial, but that is between us and them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.580" offset="5519551">If there are no further questions, I would like to save some time in rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.003" offset="5553301">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.222" offset="5566153">We submit that the question before this Court is whether a State Court has the ability in collateral review proceedings to establish its own procedures and develop how it is going to review new case law precedent arising out of its own Court and other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.631" offset="5631773">We submit that in this situation, the retroactive application is not compelled, either constitutionally or otherwise, in the Yates decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.039" offset="5677435">We contend that it was simply a determination by the South Carolina Supreme Court of the limits of the type of review it would give in State habeas proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.997" offset="5721216">In that situation, a somewhat unique situation that was presented before this Court, it said it would only look at certain situations and those situations were if the trial court that entered the conviction lacked subject matter jurisdiction over that situation, and secondly if the criminal conduct involved in the case was not subject to criminal sanction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.477" offset="6019117">No, it's a decision only to consider those claims that hold that the trial court's jurisdiction was null and void or that the particular conduct involved was not subject to criminal sanctions in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.386" offset="6074810">If any decision falls outside of those decisions, then it will not consider those retroactively in its original jurisdiction in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.492" offset="6119218">There is a State post-conviction relief proceeding that Mr. Yates proceeded to apply on that does provide certain relief in constitutional cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.884" offset="6164775">And it would provide relief on constitutional issues, if those issues were not raised or could not have been raised in the direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.441" offset="6203019">Mr. Bruck has argued somewhat convincingly, I would submit, that in favorem vitae review applies in this case and in any capital case in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.630" offset="6247740">But a close reading of those cases would reveal that they're talking about the direct appeal situation where they have a much broader review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.236" offset="6278251">There is no case in South Carolina that sets out the proposition that in favorem vitae review does exist in State collateral proceedings either under the Uniform Post-Conviction Relief Act, or under the habeas procedures in its original writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.996" offset="6341259">We cited the case of Tyler v. State which says that it is not a substitute for an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.851" offset="6368635">So when the Court had this matter before it, they had a situation that was not raised on direct appeal, was not objected to on direct appeal in a case that occurred two years after the Sandstrom v. Montana decision came down, which the petitioner argues set the bedrock precedent for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.515" offset="6451287">Subsequent to the appeal in this decision, the South Carolina Supreme Court did hold that under a very similar charge to the charge in this case, that they held as a matter of State law that it violated the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.365" offset="6958689">Now, the South Carolina Supreme Court allows in State post-conviction relief that issues that were presented or asserted in direct appeal cannot be reasserted in State post-conviction relief or State habeas corpus proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.359" offset="13178653">State against McClary, the first time they said they would not apply Elmore retroactively was a statutory Uniform Post-conviction Relief Act proceeding.</text>

Aiken, the Skipper case that this Court summarily reversed, that was a Uniform Post-Conviction Relief statutory proceeding where the claim had been raised at trial, it had been raised on direct appeal, it had been raised at the trial level in collateral attack, and there was never a habeas proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.444" offset="13291084">The distinction that the State has attempted to create between a State Constitutional habeas corpus remedy that was utilized here and post-conviction relief is simply a creation of counsel for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.669" offset="13347927">It is not to be found in South Carolina law, and I don't see how you can find it in this opinion, except perhaps arguably where there is as in this case an essentially imaginary retroactivity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.278" offset="13406336">Justice Stevens inquired whether or not the South Carolina Supreme Court has ever recognized that Sandstrom is involved here, and the answer to that is, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.801" offset="13440504">There are two cases, both of them are cited in my Reply Brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.836" offset="13452625">One is State against Peterson, and the other is State against Patrick, both of which refer really in string cites or in something like string cites to Elmore, Francis v. Franklin, and Sandstrom v. Montana, as all standing for the same proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.198" offset="13522007">I don't think there is the slightest question under South Carolina law that Elmore is simply the application of Sandstrom, and the Supreme Court has essentially admitted as much in those cases.</text>
