            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">The second case is United States Catholic Conference versus Abortion Rights Mobilization Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.543" offset="54126">This case comes before us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.224" offset="80875">The action in the dispute, which underlies this case, is a suit in which certain coalitions and persons, who advocate a pro-abortion position, are suing the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.851" offset="139389">The suit is to compel those officials to revoke the tax-exempt status as Roman Catholic Church and certain of its related entities in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.429" offset="177633">United States Catholic Conference and National Conference of Catholic Bishops were once parties to this suit but were then dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.018" offset="204069">They remained important witnesses however, which gives rise to the case before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.668" offset="226638">The plaintiffs in the tax exemption suit served subpoenas on the two Conferences as potential witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.430" offset="249626">The subpoenas were broad in scope and require production of extensive documentary evidence including documents which was alleged would reflect the church's support for pro-life candidates and initiatives in local state and federal elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.965" offset="303856">The Conferences refused to comply with the subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.273" offset="317022">After a series of court orders to produce, intertwined with other procedural motions, the Conferences remained steadfast in their refusal to turnover the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.347" offset="357355">The District Court eventually held the Conferences in civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.453" offset="373760">It assessed to fine against the two Conferences in the sum of $50,000 per day each for every day they refuse to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.662" offset="406570">The order was stayed pending appeal and the stay remains in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.279" offset="425064">The Conferences appealed the contempt sanction to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.196" offset="436767">They argued that the trial court lack any subject-matter jurisdiction over the underlying action primarily because the plaintiffs had no standing sue the Secretary of the Treasury or the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to compel them to revoke the tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.749" offset="490893">It followed, the Conferences argued, that the lower court was without authority to issue the subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.752" offset="519001">While recognizing that the Conferences were proper parties before it, since they have the right to appeal the contempt order, the Circuit held that the witnesses could challenge jurisdiction only if they allege that the District Court lack even colorable jurisdiction to entertain the contested suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.012" offset="583993">On this reasoning, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the sanctions and rejected the contention that it could examine the subject-matter jurisdiction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.730" offset="622864">We granted certiorari to resolve whether a nonparty witness may defend against the civil contempt adjudication by challenging the subject-matter jurisdiction of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.262" offset="661002">We now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.272" offset="669048">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 grants the District Court the power to issue subpoenas as to witnesses and documents, but the subpoena power of a Court cannot be more extensive than its jurisdiction, because the civil contempt adjudication is a final judgment as to the person in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.371" offset="729443">We have previously held that the contempt adjudication is appealable notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment in the underlying action.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.975" offset="759850">We hold that a nonparty witness, when appealing the finding of civil contempt, may challenge the subject matter jurisdiction of the issuing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.034" offset="792033">The challenge in this case goes to the power of the Court to issue the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.291" offset="813140">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.718" offset="834769">Justice Marshall has filed a separate dissenting opinion.</text>
