            <text syncTime="65.591" offset="392366">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.543" offset="404174">This case is here on certiorari to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals and it involves the question of whether citizens can sue for purely past violations as opposed to ongoing violations under the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.404" offset="467704">Congress has set up a rather interesting dual system of regulating effluent discharges into the nation's waterways.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.074" offset="498319">The states adopt these plans, which are approved by the Administrator of EPA, the states issue permits, which set forth the effluent limitations and standards under which the permit holders can discharge, and then to demonstrate that he is operating within the ambits of his permit, the discharger is required to constantly test the effluents and to fill out DMRs or discharge monitoring reports which are on public file and which anyone can go see.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.098" offset="642410">These DMRs show on their face when the permit holder is operating within the parameters of the permit and they also show on their face if, in fact, the discharger is exceeding those limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.859" offset="701447">Thus, citizens groups like Respondent can review these DMRs on the public record and then give sixty day notice if they're going to sue for alleged violations and if the suits are not settled, then you... they can collect $10, 000 a day, which has now been upped to $25,000 a day, except when I say collect, I really mean that that money, of course, goes to the United States and not to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.478" offset="827984">They allege in their allegations the permit holder to be in violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.984" offset="857973">They usually attach these DMRs to their complaints and as I say, in theory at least, the recovery goes to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.090" offset="894440">When Gwaltney of Smithfield purchased a meat rendering and packing plant from ITT toward the end of 1981, it found after the purchase that it had inherited some problems, principally with the biological treatment system.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="211.587" offset="976360">They did have knowledge that ITT had had problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.491" offset="996004">They thought the problems had been solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.974" offset="1005930">They found after they purchased that the problems had not been solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.311" offset="1023276">These problems involved primarily chlorine, fecal coliform, and total kjeldahl nitrogen or TKN, and it thereafter experienced various excedences and various parameters of its permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.772" offset="1093179">However, it then installed two new systems and it's undisputed that all of the excedences had, in fact, stopped prior to this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.247" offset="1139050">The Court of Appeals so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.080" offset="1146365">It was so stipulated between the parties and the Respondents even conceded in their question presented before this Court that this case involved only past violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.655" offset="1192654">First, as to chlorine, I'll touch on these just briefly, as to chlorine, we have found many problems in installing a new automatic chlorinator, but that finally fell into place in October of '82, so that there were no excedences for some twenty months or almost two years prior to the trial in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.253" offset="1283037">With the exception of start-up excedences, which I'll talk about a little bit more later, the same is really true for fecal coliform; that is, that they substantially ended in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.145" offset="1330580">We had more problem with the TKN and had to install largely a new system and there were various fits and starts, including six-month delay by the State Water Control Board itself, but the system was finally approved by the state and it began operation in October of '83 and it was fully on line in December.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.510" offset="1424099">So that the only TKN excedences between then and--</text>

            <text syncTime="349.142" offset="1526603">It's not just for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.328" offset="1531305">What it means is, Your Honor, that you have exceeded the limits in your permit, but an excedence, of course, could be a permissible upset or could be for other permissible reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.920" offset="1589715">Therefore, it's not necessarily a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.603" offset="1596507">And as I was saying, the excedences here, as far as TKN is concerned, were the unavoidable start-up excedences before suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.561" offset="1636317">The District Court held that there is no way to start-up a biological treatment system without violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.001" offset="1674038">But the important point here, really, to focus on is that the last fecal coliform excedence was four months before suit, TKN was a full month before suit, and, of course, the chlorine was twenty months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.276" offset="1735165">So, the case comes to you with the rather pristine question of whether citizens can sue for purely past violations, those which have abated prior to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.668" offset="1780722">The Court of Appeals held that they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.770" offset="1789081">We say that they can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.103" offset="1798486">The Solicitor General interprets the Act as we do, as to past violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.459" offset="1823877">We disagree with him only in respect as how he interprets the word "alleged" in the statute and, therefore, with his recommended disposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.221" offset="3774910">First of all, even the unavoidable start-up excedences had ceased prior to suit, but, secondly, even if they had been going on, it may well be that a start-up excedence would be a past violation that, for example, the state could xx after.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.401" offset="3859651">But by definition, it cannot be an on-going violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.038" offset="3878146">An on-going violation is something where something is going on because of a problem and you are not fixing it, you are not doing anything about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.381" offset="3931540">We put in a new system.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.231" offset="3938959">We spent $265,000 putting it in.</text>

            <text syncTime="961.687" offset="3976784">That's a problem getting that into shape, and those excedences cannot possibly constitute an on-going violation by their very nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.060" offset="4022237">They are the tail-end of abatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.893" offset="4033627">The whole purpose of the statute is abatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.130" offset="4046584">The statute, you've got to remember, follows directly upon the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Air Act, as you will recall, had only an injunctive provision in it, and it related only to compliance, only to on-going, only to abatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.140" offset="4110636">The one thing that this statute added to the Clean Air Act was the remedy of penalty, and that, by adding the penalty, what, it seems to me, Congress clearly did was to say we're going to add an extra incentive for you to stop sooner because by saying that you're going to get penalties and not just an injunction, it becomes very much to your advantage to stop at the earliest possible moment during the sixty-day period, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.759" offset="4229127">You get your sixty-day notice.</text>

Shell Oil that you can't just take an excedence here, an excedence there, and kind of bunch them all together and say this is an on-going violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.727" offset="4445003">What you do is you kind of look behind them and you see is there a reason for this, is it on-going, do you have here somebody who has just turned off the spigot in order to avoid a suit, is it a periodic episodic violator who is just trying to avoid suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.141" offset="4526610">In other words, the District Court can look at the facts very much as he does in a regular injunction proceeding to determine whether there is a problem which is creating excedences which you have not corrected, you have not done anything about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1455.840" offset="5953418">Now, I want to say just one thing before I get to this business of allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.160" offset="5982675">I just want to point out to you that, really, this statute makes no sense if you're going to treat it as going to past violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.302" offset="6023217">Let me just give you two brief examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.718" offset="6028964">The citizen would be giving notice of something that's already abated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.491" offset="6059997">All the courts that have looked at this agree that one of the purposes of giving sixty-day notice to the permit holder is to allow him to get himself into shape and to abate, to get rid of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.481" offset="6107958">Here you have a situation where somebody is suing for penalties five years old, maybe fifteen years old, because we don't know what the statute of limitations is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.737" offset="6144948">There is none in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.187" offset="6150799">So, you're suing for fifteen years old and you're giving the man sixty days notice for what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.991" offset="6173996">It doesn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.760" offset="6181101">The only thing that makes sense is that you're giving him sixty days notice of an on-going violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.414" offset="6199700">One other example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.547" offset="6204193">The citizen couldn't sue for past violations when the Administrator is already suing for on-going violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.638" offset="6248601">I realize this is a little difficult, but if you will look at the language in 1365, you will see that what it says is that when the Administrator is actively prosecuting a suit for compliance, the citizen can't come in and sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.968" offset="6333865">Now, the only way that makes any sense at all is if they're both trying to sue for the same thing; that is, the citizen is trying to sue for an on-going violation, and the Government is suing for an on-going violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.859" offset="6385483">If you have the citizen stopped from suing for past violations because the Government is suing for present or the Government is not suing for present and they are both suing at the time, same time, for past, it doesn't... the statute doesn't hang together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.385" offset="6451625">It makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.303" offset="6455282">But let me move then to the one point of difference between us and the Solicitor General, and that is this business of the allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.759" offset="6497078">He puts a great deal of stress on the word "alleged", and he feels that a good faith allegation of on-going violation gets the citizens past the jurisdictional requirements of an on-going violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.817" offset="6549323">Now, I want to emphasize, as we've already pointed out, that the Court of Appeals never passed on this, and that even the District Court said that the good faith allegation related only to TKN and, Justice O'Connor, TKN was the smaller part, as you know, of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.444" offset="6623824">A million dollars was for chlorination, which stopped twenty months before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.265" offset="6643155">But even as to TKN, that's very confusing because the Government concedes that once you make an allegation and we contest it under 12(b)(1), the Court can go behind it, and all we're saying is here you xx allege all you want to that something is on-going but if, in fact, we challenge you, you have the burden of proving that it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.015" offset="6758094">This is true in any kind of a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.634" offset="6768543">It's true in a suit where I file a suit against you on diversity grounds in Pennsylvania and I attach all of your prior reports to show you were there and you file a motion dismissing saying I'm sorry I moved into your state of Maryland since my last report.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.887" offset="6889542">Someone who files a group of DMRs just as someone who files your last ten quarterly reports would, in good faith, believe that we are in the midst of an on-going violation or that you are located in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.531" offset="6960177">But if that is attacked and, in fact, you have moved from Pennsylvania into Maryland and if, in fact, our violations have come to a halt prior to suit, they have been abated, they have been cleaned up and stopped, which is the purpose of the Act, then all we're saying is that you can't go ahead with a suit where a mere allegation gets you to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.998" offset="7058084">If the allegation is wrong, it doesn't make any difference what your good faith is, it is wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.877" offset="7129555">It may be useful to begin by indicating the degree to which both the District Court and the Court of Appeals did deal with the question of whether there was a risk of repetition of the violations which it had noticed for the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.022" offset="7206146">I simply want to draw the Court's attention to two footnotes, both reproduced in the Appendix to the Petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.396" offset="7247628">The first one is from the District Court Opinion and appears on page 38(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.233" offset="7275005">It's Footnote 8, and there one finds the District Court's holding, alternative holding, that at the time the complaint was filed, there was sufficient ground to believe in good faith that the problem had not been cured.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.223" offset="7414917">The problem of determining whether a violation is continuing is highlighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.644" offset="7444592">Well, in this case, skipping a bit, with the history of violations, its TKN violations, in the winter time, Gwaltney had just experienced another winter of repeated violations, despite the change it had implemented in its waste water treatment system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.970" offset="7501957">At the time of trial in December 1984, now that's six months after the complaint was filed, one of Gwaltney's own witnesses expressed doubt as to whether Gwaltney would meet its TKN violations... limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.931" offset="7565800">It was not until Gwaltney had experienced a full winter, the following winter, after the trial, without problems that it could make its motion to dismiss based on its present compliance with a secure belief that it was, indeed, in compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.827" offset="7641346">Now, the Court of Appeals, and here I refer the Court to page 7(a) of the Appendix and Footnote 9, looking at the second paragraph of that footnote, and the second sentence of that paragraph, the Court of Appeals says</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.008" offset="7734028">"a very sound argument can be made that Plaintiff's allegation of continuing violations were made in good faith despite the fact that Gwaltney had not actually violated the Act since May 15th, 1984. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2158.306" offset="8763253">Now, that, to us, highlights the reason why it is not sensible to focus on the notion of on-going violation at all, whether at the time the suit is filed or at the time when judgment is entered, and it is for that reason that we cannot embrace either the 1st Circuit's decision or the Government's brief here, albeit they might resolve this case favorably to us, because it seems to us that the logic must be that if it matters whether there's an on-going violation, the time when that matters is when penalties are being assessed, not when the suit is being filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2281.548" offset="9256236">The first is that when a violator or an alleged violator is being reported to the authorities as such, as violating the Act, it seems only fair to give him notice of that, not so that he can get off the hook for the past violations, but perhaps so that he will more quickly come into compliance and afford himself an opportunity to be liable for fewer penalties for a shorter time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2447.768" offset="9921104">In our view, standing in the citizen complainant, and he must be under the statute not any citizen but one who is aggrieved by the pollution which occurs, that means, and as is true in this case, that a member or more members of the organization must live on or near the affected water and be injured by its pollution, either in his commercial or recreational activities there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.655" offset="10056628">That shows that he has injury in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.607" offset="10068435">Now, it is perfectly true that the assessment of penalties will not immediately and directly redress that injury, but it will have a substantially beneficial effect on his interest in that river in the following three ways: first, the threat of the imposition of such penalties is likely as the EPA policy on penalties is at pains to indicate to deter him from violating in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.428" offset="10203749">But even after he has violated, if he has been assessed substantial penalties, it is an assurance that he will not return to his old ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.434" offset="10243769">Even in circumstances where injunction would not have been necessary, the assessment of penalties against him does obviously deter him from doing it again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.367" offset="11611540">--It would be extraordinary if the solution to the standing problem were to have a Treetom action, which the Court has more than once indicated presents no constitutional problem, which Congress only last year reaffirmed and widened with respect to the False Claims Act, thereby if we had a Treetom action in which the informer had a pecuniary interest because he got a share of the assessment and, yet, he would widen the class of potential plaintiffs to include any citizen, as is true under the False Claims Act, now that simply cannot be a way one solves a constitutional standing problem and, yet, it would seem to be, if this Court were to hold that there is such a problem, a simple remedy for Congress at the next session.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.756" offset="11853121">Now, I want to... I am making a very disconnected argument, but I want to stress that Congress did not use language in this statute with all the precision that one might have hoped for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.652" offset="11932637">There is loose language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.802" offset="11937235">There is misuse of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.937" offset="11945803">That is easily demonstrated by anyone who reads the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.258" offset="11967119">It seems to us that the Court ought to prefer to tax Congress with loose language, a lapse of tense perhaps, not clearly but perhaps, even somewhat illiterate sentences here and there, rather than to attribute to Congress a scheme which is downright nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.039" offset="12070250">It is downright nonsense to say there shall be penalties assessable in citizen suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.264" offset="12111106">As to that, there can be no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.264" offset="12115077">The statute says so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.031" offset="12118211">It certainly works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.799" offset="12121241">And then to say oh, but, that means only in those rare cases, because they must be rare, in which despite having been notified sixty days before, the polluter is so perverse and so improvident as to continue his evil ways until the day of filing or perhaps the day of judgment, maybe that's the Government's position, I'm not sure, because otherwise he is excused from all penalties and the Court has no power to impose them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.104" offset="12254466">One thing or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.204" offset="12258855">It is conceivable to hesitate to give the power to assess penalties going to the Treasury for private payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.958" offset="12293859">One can understand that, but once you do give a plaintiff that power, you don't take it all back from him and make it available only in that rare case that it will almost never occur; that is the case where the polluter is so perverse and so improvident as to continue his violation long enough to give the Court jurisdiction to enter these awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.425" offset="12399707">That simply cannot have been the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.245" offset="12419037">The... it was mentioned that Section 505(1)(b), this is reproduced in Petitioner's brief at page 3, refers to an action to require compliance and that is an action to require compliance by a citizen which would be barred if the Government had previously filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.839" offset="12581415">And the suggestion is that an action for penalties is not an action to require compliance; therefore, Congress is telling us here that it never intended to authorize an action for penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.951" offset="12649855">Now, we know it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.001" offset="12658006">So, we're a bit at a loss, but the other thing to be noticed about this provision is that it doesn't use language quite so fastidiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.675" offset="12696771">The words are that the Federal or State Governments, the citizens suits will not lie if the Federal or State Governments has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil or criminal action in a court of the United States to require compliance with the standard of limitations and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.838" offset="12781408">Let me say a criminal action is not, strictly speaking, an action to require compliance any more than an action to collect penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.277" offset="12815158">What is proved here is simply that Congress was not punctilious in its use of language, not that it meant that there was no action by the citizen to secure an assessment of penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.804" offset="12881300">Indeed, the Congress, in 1985-86 and '87, made quite clear that it understood itself some years earlier to have authorized citizens suits in respect of wholly past violations and to the assessment of penalties without an injunction in those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.229" offset="13042946">--Again, Justice Scalia, I wonder whether they really meant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.533" offset="13064157">I think that is rather a lapse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.984" offset="13077950">We do not claim that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.936" offset="13085787">The Section 309(d) was added in 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.379" offset="13155586">It had been prepared in 1985 and 1986, the provision, for quite independent reasons, was vetoed by the President, and, so, was not enacted in its final form until 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.854" offset="13201457">Its purpose, so far as we're concerned, was to add to the Clean Water Act an ability for the Administrator to assess penalties administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.226" offset="13246910">He had already issued cease and desist orders administratively, but he could not assess penalties in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.066" offset="13278361">Having given the Administrator that authority and we are clear on both sides that this authority relates solely to past events, solely to past violations, which attract the civil penalties, Congress went on to say that a citizens suit would lie in respect of the same violations only if notified or filed before the Administrator acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.672" offset="13424752">Now, according to the Petitioner, that was unnecessary to say because there could be no citizen suit notified or filed in respect to purely past violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.765" offset="13485147">Here is Congress indicating that it understood otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.835" offset="13509388">I may say that the Petitioner himself obviously understood otherwise during the eleven months before the filing of the motion to dismiss on this ground and when it took the trouble to seek amendment of the summary judgment that had been entered in August 1984, to absolve itself in respect of the violations that had occurred before it acquired the property, what was the point of that, except that it feared that penalties would be assessed in respect of those old violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.092" offset="13658391">It was only eleven months later that, and only when the 5th Circuit handed down its Hamford decision that anybody for the first time focused on the present tense in 505 and said, oh, this qualifies, the entire statute, we had it wrong, no penalties can be assessed in a citizen suit, except only, when for reasons not easy to understand, when they are, in effect, combined with an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.086" offset="13814394">The one time you don't need penalties because the injunction serves the purpose and its violation will, of course, attract civil and criminal contempt penalties of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.226" offset="13866953">For these reasons, we pledge affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.569" offset="13928288">Just a few very quick point, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.188" offset="13946783">I would urge that you read the end of Footnote 9 which my good friend for the Respondent xx did not get to, and call your attention to the first part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.559" offset="13980324">We filed a motion to dismiss almost a year after the last violation, which clearly alerted the District Court Judge that there had been no violations during the course of that year when he ruled he was fully familiar with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.303" offset="14035286">I have to go outside of the record to make the following statement, and that is that there have been none for now four years, and I say that with equanimity because I am sure my Respondents won't dispute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.092" offset="14078440">There was one hurricane upset, but other than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.729" offset="14092964">The problem with the Article 3 is that I think it may be directed to your question, Justice Scalia, to perhaps the wrong point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.370" offset="14139566">The real problem with Article 3 is redressability; that is, when all of the penalties go to the Government and you don't have an injunction going to the underlying fact, you have an injury that is not redressed by any remedy and that xx the Article 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.511" offset="14196095">xx the Court to be very careful here if it's going to open the flood gates to these past suits because you know you're not only going to have these federal suits for going back we don't know how many years, maybe fifteen, but we're going to have many state claims, you're going to be trying state claims in federal courts going back fifteen years, which is going to be attached to these federal claims, which is going to cause great hazard to the federal courts.</text>
