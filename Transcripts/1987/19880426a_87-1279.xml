            <text syncTime="9.106" offset="201097">Ms. Morrison, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Ms. Alexia Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="12.158" offset="213323">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.913" offset="248327">The question before you in this matter concerns whether on its face the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act run afoul of the constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.554" offset="294929">This question was raised by the three Appellees in this matter when each was subpoenaed to give evidence before a federal grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.708" offset="323559">That grand jury was considering matters covered by Title VI of the Ethics in Government Act, and had been referred in 1986 by the Attorney General for treatment under the independent counsel provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.683" offset="375386">The Appellees moved to quash the subpoenas on the basis that Title VI was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.872" offset="404121">The District Court disagreed and ordered compliance with the subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.923" offset="420422">When the Appellees refused, they were held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.692" offset="435468">Upon review, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overruled the District Court's finding, and held the statute unconstitutional on a number of grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.618" offset="491161">Indeed, as we indicate in our brief, the court looked beyond the facts presented by this case and reached out for facts not before it in order to found a basis for finding constitutional problems with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.080" offset="560960">This statute was enacted in 1978 after several years of congressional hearings and lengthy consideration of its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.769" offset="595755">It has been reauthorized twice: in 1983 and again in 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.423" offset="618325">In each case some fine tuning has been done to the statute's provisions, but its basic approach has remained consistent over the last decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.529" offset="654792">With each passage of the Act, continuing it for five year terms, the congressional fine tuning has been done with insights provided from those who have observed operations under the Act, including the United States Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.205" offset="713515">Thus Title VI comes before you having three times undergone bicameral passage in the legislature and presentment to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.577" offset="746952">On each occasion, the then sitting President has signed the bill into law, albeit on the last occasion with expressed reservations about the Act's constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.916" offset="788330">Having made its legislative choices in enacting the bill on three different occasions, Congress's role in the independent counsel process ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.706" offset="823543">It has reserved for itself no part in the implementation of the independent counsel process.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.276" offset="845799">So unlike the cases presented to this Court in Buckley v. Valeo, INS v. Chadha, and Myers v. United States, there is no concern here about congressional aggrandizement of its powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.020" offset="900761">The statute is triggered when the Attorney General receives specific, credible information that one of the high administration officials covered by the Act's provisions has committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.660" offset="947364">If the Attorney General determines in his own unreviewable discretion that the specific, credible information constitutes grounds to investigate, he causes a preliminary investigation to be conducted under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.587" offset="1003057">If as a result of that preliminary investigation he finds there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation or prosecution is warranted, he reports that finding to the court, and his final determination on the subject ends the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.145" offset="1057287">The court has no ability to appoint an independent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.696" offset="1071497">If, on the other hand, he finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation or prosecution is warranted in one of these matters where the statute imports a conflict--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="235.968" offset="1108591">Ms. Morrison, your opponents suggest that that is really a very narrow kind of discretion that is entrusted to the Attorney General, that following the structure of the statute he is almost bound to recommend the creation of a special prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.414" offset="1170345">What is your reply to that--</text>

            <label>Ms. Alexia Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="252.830" offset="1175987">--The statute leaves the matter entirely within his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.250" offset="1197721">In fact history, we would suggest, supports the notion that the Attorney General not only is able under the statute to refuse to appoint an independent counsel where matters have been brought to his attention under the statute, but in fact on repeated occasions Attorney Generals have refused to appoint an independent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.612" offset="1271177">The matter comes to him, as would any allegations of criminal misconduct, and he uses, pursuant to the statute, the same standards and the same policies that he would apply to the review of any matter if he were trying to determine whether or not to cause a full-blown grand jury investigation to be conducted within the Department of Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.728" offset="1363546">--It's quite short.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.978" offset="1368562">You have said that Congress's function is at an end and that it has not part in the implementation of the law, but in this case Congress or members of Congress did indeed send a letter to the Attorney General, did they not, asserting that there were reasonable grounds to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.712" offset="1463543">What does the Attorney General have to do when the alleged defense consists of false testimony before the Congress, and he gets a letter from the Congress saying that in our view there was false testimony?</text>
            <text syncTime="341.572" offset="1530939">Can he possibly conclude within the short period of time that he's left for the investigation that there is not reasonable grounds to investigate--</text>

            <text syncTime="350.077" offset="1565003">It would very much depend on the facts before him, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.029" offset="1580781">In this matter the congressional, as interpreted by the Department of Justice, encompassed no fewer than four individuals as to whom the Congress believed that their processes had been violated.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="366.337" stopTime="371.539">

          <turn speaker="alexia_morrison" startTime="371.539" stopTime="395.356">
            <label>Ms. Alexia Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="371.539" offset="1650789">Under the statute, and it would seem to us as a matter of basic, inherent powers, any citizen, any body, any entity would be free under the statute to bring their concerns about administration misconduct to the attention of the Attorney General, and command thereby, simply by making allegations, that the review required by the statute take place.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="395.356" stopTime="409.914">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="395.356" offset="1746084">--What if that letter reaches the Attorney General on the 80th day after his investigation of whether there are reasonable grounds to further investigate continues, and he has ten days to check that out--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alexia_morrison" startTime="409.914" stopTime="556.676">
            <label>Ms. Alexia Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="409.914" offset="1804389">The Attorney General has, under the statute as it existed when the matter before the Court was referred for independent counsel treatment, a total of 90 days within which to proceed with the preliminary investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.226" offset="1869591">So that information coming to him would trigger the commencement of that 90 day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.112" offset="1893101">Indeed, under the 1987 reauthorization, the Attorney General gets an additional 15 day period within which to make a determination as to whether or not there is reason to even conduct a preliminary investigation, and then the 90 day period begins to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.289" offset="1949839">And the statute, in all of its incarnations, has made provision for those occasions on which 90 days does not prove adequate, for the Attorney General to make an application, and he is allowed, under the statute, to go to the court and seek an additional 60 days where he needs that additional time to make his determination under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.684" offset="2027370">Indeed, it is probably worth noting on that point that in the very matter before the Court, the Attorney General did not comply with the 90 day requirement that he act on the allegations referred to him by the House Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.693" offset="2083481">Despite that fact the 90th day passed, and nothing happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.497" offset="2102707">Nothing occurred in this matter until the Attorney General, after the 90 day period, made his reference to the court in which he asked that only one of a number of people covered by that House Judiciary Committee report actually be subject to independent counsel treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.840" offset="2168013">Once the Attorney General determines that an independent counsel should be appointed, he makes a report to the court providing sufficient information to the court so that it can fulfill its appointing function.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.515" offset="2222766">Save for this appointing function thus invoked by the Attorney General, the court, like the Congress, plays no further role in the implementation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.324" offset="2266025">Granted as an incident of the appointment power, the court defines the independent counsel's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.978" offset="2292565">This, as a matter of practice, has been the subject of the Department of Justice of a specific jurisdictional recommendation in the report that goes from the Attorney General to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.119" offset="2337182">In the case before the Court here, the Special Division of the U.S. Court of Appeals actually adopted almost verbatim the jurisdictional recommendation made by the Attorney General in his report seeking an independent counsel to--</text>

            <text syncTime="565.965" offset="2428506">Under the statute the court is given the information made available by the Attorney General, but is also empowered to define jurisdiction within the bounds established by that report.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.129" offset="2513248">We would suggest, Your Honor, that that is not an Executive Branch power in the sense that it is not a substantive part of the investigation conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.901" offset="2548252">The court plays no role in formulating the investigative plan, if you will, in determining at whom the independent counsel is look: that is determined by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.673" offset="2587331">The court, in this statute, is given the power to limit, to place bounds on the arena within which the independent counsel may investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.898" offset="2628291">I would submit to the Court that it would have been perfectly proper had the Congress determined that once an Attorney General determined a matter was appropriate for independent counsel investigation, the Congress might have provided that the court simply appoint an appropriate person to conduct the investigation, and to allow that person, as any normal prosecutor would, to take the matter and follow the investigation where it lead.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.930" offset="2724422">That is what happens in hundreds of federal prosecutor's offices around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.715" offset="2739573">A matter comes in, and the investigation proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.667" offset="2751380">But Congress decided not to follow that process, but rather to have neither the Attorney General, who by statute has a conflict here, nor the independent counsel as to whom they wanted to set some definitions or boundaries to make the determination of exactly what the outside parameters of the investigation would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.229" offset="2825568">But in this case they interposed the court and asked that the court review the matters brought to its attention by the Attorney General, and fashion a reasonable jurisdictional mandate, allowing--</text>

            <text syncTime="838.841" offset="3520007">We went to the Attorney General initially, and asked that our jurisdictional mandate be expanded to include additional individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.994" offset="3544666">When that request was turned down, we took the provision in Section 594(e) of the statute, which permitted us to address that question, to the court and asked the court to review the matter in the connection of its role as the definer of jurisdiction, the person who is setting the parameters for the appointed individual to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.145" offset="3645290">Under 594(e), the court took not only our request but also a submission from the Department of Justice, and it ultimately turned out submissions in sort of amicus capacity from the two individuals as to whom we sought to gain jurisdiction, and considered all of those matters in connection with its review of the scope of our jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.308" offset="3733897">In connection with the submission made by the Department of Justice, they raised constitutional questions about the statute, particularly as it would be affected by the interpretation that we were asking the court to place on Section 594(e).</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.995" offset="6952706">I mean, the other side argues that that would create less problems because it seems much worse to have the courts appointing the people who are going to present cases to them, which they are supposed to judge impartially, than it would be for judges to appoint officers who are going to go off to fight a war that they have nothing to do with--</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.123" offset="7021146">But of course that contention, Your Honor, flies in the face of a long tradition of judicial appointment of attorneys to represent parties before them, and in those cases there is inherently the fact that the attorneys being appointed to handle matters that may well end up in that courthouse as litigated matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.168" offset="7101395">The suggestion in the statute is that courts participating in the appointment cannot in any future way participate in review of any independent counsel prosecutions or cases that flow from the appointment, and so there is a greater insulation there than there would be even in the normal case of court appointment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.392" offset="7478289">The Congress has delegated a vital function to the court in the implementation of the Ethics Act, but has striven to maintain that function within the boundaries of the Appointments Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.901" offset="7528235">One manner in which the Appointments Clause carries forward the idea of Separation of Powers is by dividing the function of creating an office under law, and the power of appointing a person to fill that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.094" offset="7593019">In the Ethics Act, the sole power delegated to the court, of substance, is the power of designating an individual to fill an office which has been created by the action of the Attorney General.</text>

            <text syncTime="1911.580" offset="7810985">--The textual grant of authority to the Congress is indeed a broad grant of authority, and a grant of authority which this Court recognized in the Siebold case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.103" offset="7853094">But it has been no part of the defense of this statute, that the power is unbounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.757" offset="7879739">First, as a practical matter, what the Framers did in the context of the clause which grants this discretion is that it created substantial inducements for self-restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.183" offset="7929372">Whenever the Senate would agree to a statute that would vest appointment authority in the President alone, or the heads of departments, or the courts of law, it must of necessity forgo its power to advise and consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.526" offset="7986737">And whenever the House and Senate joined together in a statute that would vest power in the courts of law, they both must agree to forgo any political influence over the appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.882" offset="8032190">But moreover, if one looks at the history of the utilization of this clause, from the first idea... not accepted, but proposed... to vest appointment authority in the court to appoint the Attorney General, from the first enactment of authority of the court to appoint marshals when the marshall appointed by the President has a conflict of interest, to that of appointing interim United States attorneys, to the enactment in Siebold and to this Act, one will see that the pattern that the Congress has historically recognized as a valid pattern is one which recognizes the need for an important degree of affinity between the appointment and function and the role of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.029" offset="8220794">And so we do not come before the Court today suggesting that there is an unlimited, unbridled power of the Congress to reach out throughout the Executive Branch, but it is one which is carefully tailored to a function in which the courts may indeed have a recognition of the problem presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.042" offset="8304804">A function that is vested in the court here is a single function of appointing a counsel who mirrors the essential characteristic of the Judicial Branch.</text>

            <text syncTime="2085.292" offset="8505842">The Special Division has no power to go beyond that subject matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2335.873" offset="9508213">And it seems to me, I am concerned about the reality of affecting the balance between the two Branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.145" offset="9545306">Anyone who has been in a high level in the Executive Branch has occasion to testify before Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.585" offset="9579057">The system has certain conflicts built in it, and that is all very good; it's the way it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.370" offset="9602149">But isn't the result of this that whenever there is testimony displeasing to a committee of Congress, and the committee believes that the testimony was not forthright, was not fully disclosing and so forth, which happens not infrequently, that committee writes a letter to the Attorney General, and the consequence is unless the Attorney General can determine within 90 days that there is no basis for even investigating further, the individual is subjected to a special prosecutor investigation by someone not appointed by the Attorney General, not appointed by the President, by a staff that didn't sign on simply to investigate but that signed on to investigate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.021" offset="9812800">That does not really shift the balance of power between the Legislature and Executive officials to any significant degree?</text>

            <text syncTime="2423.745" offset="9859612">I do not think so, Justice Scalia, and for this reason: committees of the Congress have always been able to refer allegations to the Department of Justice, and whatever political influence committees can bring to bear, they have historically been able to bring to bear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.260" offset="9945711">This statute does not change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.144" offset="9953235">Rather it channels the communication to a very specific communication to the Attorney General, who is then given the power to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.818" offset="9995971">In 1982, the Congress, out of concern and at the suggestion of the Department of Justice, placed into the law the obligation of the Attorney General to weigh the allegations against the established policies of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.864" offset="10064098">It is not his duty to simply ask for an independent counsel because a committee of the Congress has asked for it, but is to engage in sufficient investigation to determine whether there are reasonable grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.504" offset="10114671">This case is the example of that: the Attorney General's determination was a discriminating determination which exonerated two of the possible subjects of this investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.912" offset="10164304">If I may speak for a moment about the removal provision, which we think is quite central to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.351" offset="10202129">The removal provision is one which the Congress has worked out extensively with Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.441" offset="10230446">The first proposals were to vest removal authority in the court, but persuaded particularly by the American Bar Association, the Congress concluded that that might invest a degree of supervisory power in the court which belonged properly in an officer of the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.902" offset="10304320">And so it is the Attorney General who has the sole power to remove an independent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.656" offset="10331279">At first the standard that the Congress utilized was the standard adopted by the Executive Branch in the Watergate matter, where their counsel had engaged in extraordinary impropriety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.714" offset="10375582">But when the Department of Justice returned to the Congress in 1982 and asked for a lowering of that standard to good cause, the Congress responded and lowered the standard to good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.771" offset="10423752">And then in 1987, to avoid any question whether the appointing court would have a vested interest in maintaining its appointee in office, the Congress removed authority to review removal of an independent counsel from the appointing court to the District Court, and it further eliminated a special standard of review that had been enacted earlier in the law which would have allowed for review of any error of law or fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2665.387" offset="10826247">Now there is certainly a central idea to the good cause removal provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.056" offset="10936902">But beyond that, the Congress has not tried to specify in the text of the law the exact parameters of the good cause provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.626" offset="10971174">There is indeed a message that pervades the Congress's consideration of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.149" offset="10997297">The President is entitled to whatever constitutionally based authority he has and responsibilities he has to assure that the independent counsel, as any other officer of the government, stays within the constitutionally proscribed parameters of his office, and grants due recognition to the constitutional needs that the President may express.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.847" offset="11100115">If there is ever an controversy about a specific removal, that controversy would come back before the court, and the same constitutional values that are now urged upon the Court may be heard by the court at that time, but also in light of a record which would better illuminate the application of those values to a specific removal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3035.992" offset="12308644">If we could put it in guidelines we could do away with the President and just put a bunch of books on the shelves and have people follow those guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.264" offset="12337692">The essence of the Executive is the ability to make policy judgments based upon specific facts of complex kinds of interests and to resolve them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.637" offset="12379279">So it is not resolvable by a set of guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.656" offset="12395266">In addition, while there are guidelines in the Department of Justice, from what we can tell and from what commentators have said, and as set forth in the brief of the three Attorneys Generals, those guidelines concern an extraordinarily limited... as they have to be... part of the total discretion of the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.919" offset="12476350">So the provision, I think, both, if you interpret it consistent with its legislative history, is not binding.</text>

            <text syncTime="4012.672" offset="16215413">There has been a great discussion here about how one should interpret the Appointments Clause, and it seems to us that there are a number of criteria.</text>

            <text syncTime="4042.691" offset="16335471">I think it should be read in tandem with the function of appointments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.893" offset="16348219">In a number of cases, Myers through Buckley, this Court has said that the appointments function is tied to the faithful execution obligation, and it should be read in terms of that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.301" offset="16397852">And thirdly, it should accommodate the specific requirements of Article III, that the courts remain separate and independent, requirements that are reflected in a constitutional history in which there is no indication of court appointment of executive officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="4650.046" offset="18764859">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.932" offset="18780428">We raise a number of particular objections to the independent counsel statute: to the total exclusion of the President from her appointment, from the very significant limitation on the President's power to direct and remove the independent counsel, and on the inappropriate involvement of the judiciary in the appointment, direction, and removal of the independent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.553" offset="18898919">But our central objection is that this statute strips the President of purely Executive function, criminal prosecution in an important class of cases, and lodges that function in one almost wholly untethered to the President, and at the same time it deprives the Congress of its power of advice and consent, but worse, it absolves the Congress of its weightiest and most painful duty, which is the scrutiny of the Executive Branch, backed up by the painful duty of impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.546" offset="19066835">Now the Appointments Clause problem, to our mind, is simply the most extreme of the constitutional anomalies in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.086" offset="19109048">It was Justice White, in a separate opinion in Buckley v. Valeo, who said the appointment power was a major building block fitted into the constitutional structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.644" offset="19155233">By removing that block, this is only one of the several ways in which this statute deforms that structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.434" offset="19194417">Now, one of the reasons that are offered for these constitutional anomalies, the importance to the public to feel that Executive officers would be investigated and prosecuted with vigor and impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.229" offset="19265574">And the instance which the Appellant and all of her amici urge is the Watergate episode.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.300" offset="19289920">That is the episode which is thought to teach the necessity for this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.954" offset="19312490">With respect we submit that that episode teaches the exact opposite lesson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.940" offset="19340493">True, the dismissal of Special Prosecutor Cox was regrettable, but it was not a constitutional catastrophe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.332" offset="19386051">Had Special Prosecutor Jaworski been dismissed, had the Watergate task force been disbanded, had those prosecutions been abandoned, that would have been another matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.723" offset="19439550">But everyone knows that those prosecutions proceeded to their denouement without missing a beat.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.912" offset="19472359">And they did so not because of jury rigged constitutional innovations such as we have here, but because of public pressure and the long, deep shadow of Congress's power of impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.671" offset="19535367">That is our constitutional system, and that is precisely how our Framers envisaged that the matter should work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.044" offset="19568908">To be sure, it did not work without struggle and strain, but it is a central fallacy of this statute to think that a supremely political object... and I use the word politics in its high sense, of those occasions which concentrate the moral and practical sense of the people... can be accomplished without politics, that in some sense it can be turned over to serene persons operating outside of the political process, platonic guardians of sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.271" offset="19725747">Now, in Humphrey's Executor the Court described an appropriate occasion for such percipiences.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.044" offset="19760856">It said that it's appropriate to have a commission whose duties are neither political nor executive, like the Interstate Commerce Commission, and that commission can then exercise the trained judgment of a body of experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.636" offset="19823236">That is not what the special prosecutor, what the independent counsel does, and it is profoundly wrong to absolve the political branches of their responsibilities, and hand over those responsibilities to persons who act totally untethered to any politically responsible person.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.835" offset="19916023">This temptation is a temptation to which the Congress yielded on one other occasion, in the Gramm-Rudman trigger mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.691" offset="19955416">And this, it seems to us, is a more severe and a more dangerous instance of that fallacious view of the Constitution because the liberty of the subject is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.367" offset="20014139">Now turning to the question of the Appointments Clause and who is subject to Presidential appointment, the Appellant and her amici relentlessly misunderstand our submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.877" offset="20072235">We do not say that every subordinate person is an inferior officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.833" offset="20112046">I do not know whether I am principal officer or an inferior officer, but it is quite clear and it is made clear by statute that I am subordinate to the Attorney General and to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.175" offset="20165336">What we say is that subordinancy is a necessary condition for a person being an inferior officer, and it is hard to imagine any officer in the government who is less subordinate in her function than is the independent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.323" offset="20246002">The independent counsel is considerably less subordinate than am I, and than is the Attorney General of the President.</text>

            <text syncTime="5068.970" offset="20440562">It is not entirely clear whether they are officers of the United States or officers of Congress, but if they are officers of the United States, it is quite clear that the Appointments Clause, as it relates to inferior officers, must lodge that appointment either in the President or in the courts of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.050" offset="20528856">There is no alternative so there's no particular anomaly or any particular problem that Congress decided to lodge the appointment of the Librarian of Congress in the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.393" offset="20586221">So I think those particular group of cases do not cause the difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.814" offset="20611925">It does seem that by allowing this kind of cross branch appointment, we cause the question of who is an inferior officer and who is a principal officer to bear far too much weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.144" offset="20689248">It really is not particularly important whether the Solicitor General is an inferior or a principal officer, an inferior officer like the Cadet in Perkins who figures so prominently in the Appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.637" offset="20751210">It isn't important because it's quite clear that the Solicitor General, like the Cadet in Perkins, is wholly subordinate to a person in the Presidential chain of command.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.913" offset="20812337">It is only when you have cross branch appointments that it becomes crucially important to decide whether a particular person is important enough, subordinate enough to be subject to the inferior officer clause or the principal officer clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.160" offset="20893316">We submit that these are problems which the framers did not intend us to face and that we need not face, because the appropriate thing to do is simply to recognize and to maintain the integrity of each of the branches, and not countenance a system which would allow the Executive Branch to be shattered into a thousand small offices, each of whom would be appointed by courts of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.614" offset="21023093">Now, there's one further point that needs to be mentioned regarding the control of the independent counsel by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.339" offset="21066038">It does seem to us that the picture of the prosecutorial function which the Appellant and her Amici offer is one which is scarcely recognizable to anybody who has ever wielded that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.298" offset="21129881">I think that power is best described by Mr. Justice Jackson when he was Attorney General in the Attorney General's amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.406" offset="21170319">That is not a power, the prosecutor's power is not one which is exhausted by viewing her as an automaton who mechanically processes evidence and law by something called a bureaucratic set of policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.535" offset="21238864">Do we prosecute for a felony when more than one ounce of marijuana is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.689" offset="21263419">What is involved is judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.122" offset="21273137">What is involved is discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.157" offset="21285362">That was the lesson which Justice Jackson taught in that splendid address to young prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.913" offset="21316291">And that kind of judgment, that kind of discretion, we urge, is a kind of discretion which can only be safely lodged in somebody who is responsible to an elected official, an elected official who if he does not properly control that responsibility is subject to Congressional oversight and if need be, impeachment.</text>

            <text syncTime="5322.951" offset="21456516">Mr. Martin indicated in his argument that the case that he thought might be important to the Court discussed the President's pardon power that's constitutionally textually committed to the President personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.662" offset="21531331">In this matter, we are talking about enforcement powers that are created by statute, and Congress has found within its appropriate power, we think, that individual matters of criminal law enforcement should not be matters of politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.088" offset="21589009">Unless there are further questions?</text>

            <text syncTime="5358.790" offset="21599876">I have just one since you're not going to use the rest of your time anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.176" offset="21621401">What do you interpret the meaning of the words, if possible, to be in that provision that says you must follow the Attorney General's written guidelines and policies, if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.836" offset="21672079">When would it not be possible?</text>

            <label>Ms. Alexia Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="5380.203" offset="21685453">I believe the statute says, except when not possible.</text>

            <label>Ms. Alexia Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="5383.772" offset="21699768">And I made reference before to the fact that there are certain policies within the Department's written guidelines that require checking up the chain of command.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.128" offset="21741146">Some of those would be checks that would not be possible under the independent counsel statute where the independent counsel is acting in lieu of the Attorney General for purposes of let's say an immunity grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.186" offset="21793391">So that in those instances, it would not be possible to follow the established policies of the Department.</text>
