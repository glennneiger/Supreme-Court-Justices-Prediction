            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">In second of the two cases, No. 87-4, Mark Erick Wheat versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.074" offset="32287">Here the petitioner and numerous co-defendants were charged with participating in an elaborate drug distribution conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.441" offset="65724">At trial, two of the petitioner's co-defendants were represented by an attorney named, Eugene Iredale.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.788" offset="91115">Shortly before his -- his trial was to commence, petitioner asked the District Court to allow the substitution of Iredale as his counsel as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.186" offset="128731">Both petitioner and his co-defendants were willing to waive the right to conflict-free counsel but the District Court denied the substitution motion on the basis of what it perceived as to be irreconcilable and unwaiveable conflicts of interest for Iredale.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.902" offset="191530">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.754" offset="202919">In an opinion filed today, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that the District Court did not err in refusing to approve petitioner's proposed substitution of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.174" offset="248686">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Brennan joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.615" offset="266449">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun joins.</text>
