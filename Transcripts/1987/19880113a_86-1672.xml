            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="15.891" offset="202664">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.725" offset="218024">The issue in this case concerns the two-tiered structure established by Congress to govern the tax treatment of a corporation and its shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.590" offset="253446">To briefly summarize that structure, it treats a corporation as a separate taxable entity that must recognize on its own return the tax consequences of its business activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.027" offset="299212">The shareholders' individual taxes are affected by this business activity only indirectly, that is, in connection with their own dealings with the corporate entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.463" offset="340904">Corporate income is recognized by the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.866" offset="354592">The shareholders pay tax on corporate income only when they receive a distribution of corporate earnings, either as dividends or liquidating distributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.761" offset="390118">Similarly, when a corporation suffers net operating losses in a given year, that loss is deductible by the corporation on its own return and may be carried back to earlier years or carried forward for up to 15 years to be offset against corporate income in future years.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.023" offset="459186">Such a loss would be reflected on the shareholders' return, only if they dispose of their interest in the corporation or liquidate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.417" offset="484786">Back in the 1940s, this Court in the Moline case, considered the question whether this two-tiered tax structure applied in full to so-called dummy corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.577" offset="533374">That is, situations where a closely-held corporation's interest are essentially congruent with those of its shareholders or perhaps in many cases a sole shareholder, and where the business activity of the corporation is quite limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.956" offset="586873">The facts of the Moline case are in many respects quite similar to those of the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.179" offset="607771">In Moline, the Court held that the separate entity doctrine was fully applicable to the facts there.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.244" offset="632012">In that case, the mortgagee had required an individual borrower to set up a corporation to hold title to mortgaged property.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.380" offset="660643">The corporation engaged in little other business activity, and its expenses were paid directly by the individual shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.696" offset="689900">Despite this limited activity and the undisputed fact that the individual was the beneficial owner of the property, the Court held that the corporation had to pay tax on the gain when the property was sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.492" offset="741100">The Court summarized its holding, as follows, and I quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="155.196" offset="759908">"Whether the purpose be to gain an advantage under the law of the state of incorporation or to avoid or to comply with the demands of creditors or to serve the creator's personal or undisclosed convenience, so long as that purpose is the equivalent of business activity or is followed by the carrying on of business by the corporation, the corporation remains a separate taxable entity. "</text>
            <text syncTime="177.942" offset="850814">The Court went on to say that once the taxpayer had chosen the corporate form for his own business purposes, he was bound by the tax consequences of this choice.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="188.218" offset="891983">There the corporation held the title to the property in its own name, the dummy corporation, didn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="194.281" offset="916225">So what this Court said was that the Code simply required the taxpayer to recognize the record state of affairs.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.300" offset="960319">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.691" offset="961887">The corporation was the owner of the property and the fact that it really didn't do anything other than operate for the individual shareholder didn't mean that that could just be transferred to the individual shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.370" offset="1004518">When the property was sold, the gain had to be recognized by the corporation and a corporate tax paid on the gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.272" offset="1024163">Now, this principle of Moline was reaffirmed several years later by the Court in the National Carbide case, and it's now a well-settled proposition, and indeed, a proposition that respondents do not directly challenge, although, as I'll explain later, we think the thrust of their argument here would seriously undermine the Moline principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.906" offset="1102739">We believe that this case is governed by the rule of Moline.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.887" offset="1118621">Respondents in this case chose the corporate form for their own business purposes, and now they seek to avoid the tax consequences of that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.393" offset="1152685">In short, they want to have their cake and eat it too.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.132" offset="1707630">Well, we think where there's a controlled corporation situation, we think there is a pretty heavy burden to be borne by the taxpayer in showing that there's actually a true agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.279" offset="1748172">The problem that requires this heavy burden, and we think this was set forth in the National Carbide case, is that the relations between a principal and his agent and the kind of control that a principal exerts over his agent is quite similar to the kind of control that a sole shareholder would exert over a closely held corporation, just in the exercise of the normal shareholder-corporation relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.499" offset="1865096">So it's kind of an easy expedient for avoiding the Moline rule to say, well, we've got this corporation, we set it up, we're controlling it, but we're not controlling it as shareholders, we're controlling it as agents, and we're going to write up a little agreement and call it an agency agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.688" offset="1925805">That's what the taxpayer tried to do in National Carbide and the Court rejected that.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.042" offset="1947225">Now, if you use an unrelated agent, then the situation is a lot clearer because there is no other basis for the control that the principal is exerting over the agent, so it's easy enough for the Court or for the Service to credit the agency agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.492" offset="5349100">But the reason for this litigation is tax avoidance, not tax avoidance in a pejorative sense, but the tax consequences of being treated as a partnership are more advantageous to the respondents than being treated as a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.630" offset="5401554">What they wanted to do was they wanted to be able to take their losses immediately and offset them against other income that they have rather than if it's treated as a corporation, they'll have to wait to take the losses until the apartment complexes begin to show profit a few years down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.001" offset="5455052">So it's an opportunity to accelerate the losses that the take.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.007" offset="5559124">And therefore we think the fact that these kind of partnerships always use a controlled corporation and the facts in this case and the facts in the Frink case that's also pending before this Court, both reflect that the partnerships were unwilling to enter into these kind of agreements unless they could use a controlled corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.722" offset="5638014">They reflect that there's more going on than just an arm's length agency relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1585.733" offset="6481978">Well, that sounds like an agency relationship to me because you don't have the Moline problem of needing to recognize the corporation as a separate taxable entity, because you don't have a dealing with a controlled corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.452" offset="6536940">I mean, Moline arises only in the case of or it addressed the relationship between the corporation and the shareholders that control it, and how the tax consequences are to be allocated between those two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.631" offset="6585632">When you don't have that kind of relationship, you don't run into the sort of problems that National Carbide dictum is concerned about and the government is concerned about in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1623.478" offset="6632966">I'd like to just make two other quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.121" offset="6639549">One is that quite apart from the issue we've been discussing here, we think in this case, the respondents fail the sixth factor of the National Carbide test which is that the corporation's here did not act as agents at all, they acted as principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.700" offset="6693883">It was essential to the success of the whole scheme that the corporation be holding the title in its own name and take out the loans in its own name, not on behalf of the partners because that would not have satisfied the Kentucky usury laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.670" offset="6749785">And second, I'd just like to point out that Congress has dealt with these kind of issues in some detail in Subchapter S of the Code in which they have recognized that in certain situations, businesses should be entitled to operate as corporations and still have the tax consequences flow through to the individuals as partnerships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.442" offset="6820838">But Congress did not view this kind of situation as one to which Subchapter S should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.158" offset="6843722">And because of a specific provision, they are not eligible for Subchapter S treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.220" offset="6863993">We think Subchapter S would be somewhat undermined if respondents can use this agency mechanism to get around it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.934" offset="6946853">That is, the attempt to clarify what the issue is in this case, to focus on some of the undisputable facts in the case, comment on the Sixth Circuit's holding in the case which held for the taxpayers in holding that they were the taxpayers and that they were entitled to the deductions claim, and point out some of the numerous fallacies that are contained in the petitioner's brief and in petitioner's argument here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.125" offset="7071614">First, I think it's very important in this case to understand that the underlying issue is an issue of who is the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.921" offset="7106723">This I think is a much more ingrained principle in this case than the two-tier tax system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.318" offset="7148310">And once you get to the point of looking to who is the taxpayer in the case, and then look at the facts as found by the Tax Court and accepted by the Sixth Circuit, there is no question but what the income was earned and the expenses were incurred by the partnerships and the proprietorships, and not by the corporation which had a very very minor part in this whole picture insofar as its activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2099.908" offset="8538755">Now, the issue in this case is not whether the nominee corporations can be disregarded as separate entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.686" offset="8585776">We have made it clear throughout our brief that they are recognized as separate entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.662" offset="8609704">It's only a question once they are recognized, you do not actually have to attribute to them, income that they did not earn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.847" offset="8646484">And this is the principal emphasis that I want to make on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.920" offset="8670726">The real issue, the one that was tried in the Tax Court, and the one that was considered in the Circuit Court, is whether the proprietorships and the partnerships which generated the income and expenses may have the deductions for the net losses that were generated in the earlier years of construction and operations of the apartment complexes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.937" offset="8762781">Now, it's important to understand that there were eight apartment complexes and each of them was owned by separate entities in the terms that two of the projects were owned and operated by Mr. Bollinger, as separate proprietorships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.012" offset="8843134">Six of them were owned by the partnerships in which Mr. Bollinger was only one of the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.846" offset="8874481">As far as the operation of the five partnerships which were using Creekside, Inc. as the corporate nominee, Mr. Bollinger did not have control of four of those in the sense of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.025" offset="8983150">He didn't have control of any of them in the sense of voting power, because in the most he had in the five partnerships, the most he had in four of the partnerships was a fifty percent ownership interest, and he had a sixty-six and two-thirds interest in one of the partnerships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.979" offset="9071026">But in that one, under Kentucky law in the absence of specifying otherwise, each partner, irrespective of the percentage interest, had equal vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.916" offset="9110732">So we feel that in those five cases or five situations, there was a lack of control of the partnerships by Mr. Bollinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.437" offset="9172799">Now, the Government makes a comported argument that there should be some kind of a constructive ownership implied which we think is completely without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.953" offset="9210938">Now, I'd like to just mention briefly some of the very what I consider to be crucial facts that were found by the Tax Court and accepted by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and they are that the proprietorships and the partnerships were the owners of the apartment complexes, and they remained the real and true direct owners upon the transfer of the bare legal title to the nominee corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.998" offset="9351059">And the transfers to the nominee corporations were for the limited purposes of holding title and placing mortgages on the properties to secure the loans taken out for the benefit of the partnerships or the proprietorships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.208" offset="9403931">The proprietorships and the partnerships constructed the businesses of constructing and operating the apartment complexes in proprietorship form or partnership form and not in corporate form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.311" offset="9476342">This is a specific finding that was made by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.225" offset="9487941">All of these are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.025" offset="9495150">The proprietorships and the partnerships constructed the apartment buildings, they operated and managed the apartment buildings, they generated the income and the expenses from the operations of the apartment buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.894" offset="9554710">They received the income and they paid the expenses in connection with the construction, the development and operation of the projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.850" offset="9590445">They made all the interest and principal payments on the loans.</text>

            <text syncTime="2398.495" offset="9733074">Here they were not because under the nominee agreement that was present in each one of these projects, the only owner of the project was the partnership or the proprietorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.476" offset="9792946">The only ownership that the corporation had was bare record title, nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.444" offset="9836832">By the same token, none of the operations were made in the name of the corporation, and everyone who dealt with the partnership or the proprietorship was dealing with them as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.843" offset="9894406">The corporation was not involved and did not become liable for what the partners were doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.041" offset="11423196">And the argument was made as an alternative that there was an agency relationship that would bring the money back and the corporation was merely acting as agent, but there was no agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.031" offset="11471157">And this Court in affirming the reversal by the Court of Appeals pointed that out, that there was no agency agreement or any other restriction on the title and ownership that the corporation had.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.813" offset="11998308">The only reason the corporation is letting these people have the income is because these people are the sole shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.637" offset="12021609">You don't think any corporation in its right mind would say, well, we own the property but other people can have the income.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles R. Hembree</label>
            <text syncTime="2977.409" offset="12048672">Well, I think the big distinction, Justice Scalia, is that the income was not anything that the corporation had any right to under the agreement that is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.960" offset="12102902">Now, I know this doesn't fully answer your question, but the reason that it doesn't go to the corporation and can't go to the corporation in this instance is because the corporation had no right to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.463" offset="12168940">Now, if there is an agreement that gives the corporation the right to it, and the corporation earns it, now, the agreement has to be one that reflects a relationship and this is what National Carbide is all about is the relationship that is created by the agency agreement must be one that is reflecting the activities that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.320" offset="12268414">And I think in this instance, the Sixth Circuit came up with the right results and that is that you look to the overall situations to see if the normal indices of agency have been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.106" offset="12355558">And if they have been satisfied, then the agency is going to be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.049" offset="12379278">The way you determine that is comparing that with whether or not an unrelated entity would be willing to do the same thing that the related entity has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.381" offset="12436643">And you do not get into the consideration, and incidentally, this is the only real basis that the petitioner has pointed out for this failure of the so-called Fifth Circuit on the relationship aspect is that there was no consideration paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.385" offset="12528594">The consideration, as you, Justice Scalia, have pointed out is not necessary insofar as establishing a valid agency relationship consideration is pure black letter restatement agency law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.401" offset="12624724">That you don't need the consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.972" offset="12634964">So that being the only thing that the petitioner is relying on, we get back into an area where we get lost on trying to use a principal that is set up in Moline Properties, and then another principle that is set up in National Carbide they tried to pull together but they don't mesh because of the different situations that were involved, and because of the different principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.591" offset="12749485">On the one hand, you're talking about a separate entity, and on the other hand, you're talking about the basically an anticipatory assignment of income in National Carbide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.811" offset="12802357">I should like to... I don't like to spend much of my time pointing out errors that have been made in the brief of the petitioner... but I do feel that it is very important to point out certain misstatements arid distortions that are contained in the brief filed on behalf of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.068" offset="12915310">Petitioner states on page 18 as a fact that the corporation's incurred interest expense on loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.734" offset="12958047">However, the Tax Court specifically found that the partnership made all interest payments and is contrary to the statement by petitioner in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.352" offset="13000470">Petitioner also states that the corporation owned the properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.406" offset="13016665">However, the Tax Court specifically found that the corporation owned no assets and also found that the partnership, and not the corporations were the owners of the apartment complexes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.223" offset="13063999">Now, those just don't square when you talk about the statement is made in the brief and what the actual facts are as found by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.950" offset="13102870">Also, at page 18 of the brief, petitioner states that the Court of Appeals stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.504" offset="13125126">"that this supposed principal agent relationship superceded Moline Property special entity rule. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.520" offset="13161175">There is no such statement made by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.763" offset="13182177">I don't know how to deal with statements that are made in the brief, how to respond to them, when they refer to matters in the lower Court's opinion which just do not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.761" offset="13226167">Petitioner also states that the Sixth Circuit concluded that even if the corporations were viable separate entities, their income and expenses could be attributed directly to Bollinger and his partners under the agency theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.410" offset="13288757">That was not the holding of the Sixth Circuit at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.552" offset="13301296">The holding of the Sixth Circuit was that the proprietorships and the partnerships conducted the business of constructing and operating the apartments in the partnership and proprietorship forms, and not in the corporate form, and that the income realized was attributable to the efforts and assets of the proprietorships and the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.092" offset="13423444">Thus, I think it is completely erroneous and misleading for the petitioner to say in his brief that the income and expenses were considered by the Sixth Circuit to be those of the corporation and that it attributed the corporation's earnings to the partnerships and proprietorships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.225" offset="13504006">One other thing which I briefly mentioned before, but this gets to the very heart of it, at page 2 of his reply brief, the petitioner states that respondents note, at page of the brief, that</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.866" offset="13566595">"corporate ownership of properties was specified by the lenders as a prerequisite of making the loans. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.482" offset="13600972">This is a complete misstatement of what was said in respondents' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.636" offset="13625632">The statement in the respondent's brief referred only to nominal debtor and that the nominal debtor be a corporate nominee of the partnerships and that record title to the property be held by the corporate nominee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.777" offset="13682161">Now, nominal debtor and corporate nominee do not add up to ownership, and that I think also is a very misleading statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.273" offset="13732212">Recognizing that the time is just about gone, I want to make one statement that clears this whole brings the whole case I think into perspective in terms of what we're dealing with and the interpretation of the National Carbide case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.199" offset="13811833">There this Court was attempting to set up certain rules that would be useful in determining whether a valid agency arrangement existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.279" offset="13880169">The reason they were doing it was to try to determine who was the taxpayer with regard to the income that was involved in that case, and the income in that case had been earned by the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.429" offset="13932832">And because it had been earned by the agent and the agency agreement did nothing more than make an anticipatory assignment of it, the Court held that the agency agreement would not be recognized, because certainly the assignment was based on joint ownership of the two entities and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.954" offset="14034918">What the petitioner is attempting to do in this case, in using the so-called fifth factor and the so-called sixth factors in National Carbide to support--</text>

            <text syncTime="3555.249" offset="14360091">The point I want to is that Mr. Hembree's statement that the corporation should not be recognized here because it did so little is exactly the contention that was accepted by the Board of Tax Appeals in Moline and reversed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.088" offset="14415470">That's exactly inconsistent with Moline, and the more general proposition that what the Code wants to do is--</text>

            <text syncTime="3580.267" offset="14460192">That's the second point I wanted to make actually which goes to Justice Steven's question about Moline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.463" offset="14480985">Is that I think the precise holding of National Carbide, is that you can't avoid Moline simply by having an agency agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.865" offset="14510556">There was an agency agreement in National Carbide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.347" offset="14520483">That was exactly the argument that the taxpayer tried to make there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.749" offset="14534066">And what National Carbide said is that that's not good enough because the agency agreement there didn't reflect anything different than the kind of control that the shareholders exert over the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.035" offset="14571265">They just put it on a piece of paper and said that the subsidiaries will do x, y and z as agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.450" offset="14596865">But it's the same thing that the shareholders could have told them to do because of their control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.084" offset="14615464">It has to be something different from a shareholder corporation relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.816" offset="14630301">And that is, I admit, difficult to show where you take the tack of setting it up as a controlled corporation for these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.763" offset="14662171">It's better to use an unrelated agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.803" offset="14670321">But that's, you're stuck with it if you need to set up a corporation for some business purpose as the taxpayer certainly had to do here, then you are stuck with the tax consequences of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.821" offset="14710341">And with respect to the question of whether they complied with the Kentucky Usury laws, they certainly did comply with the Kentucky Usury laws.</text>
