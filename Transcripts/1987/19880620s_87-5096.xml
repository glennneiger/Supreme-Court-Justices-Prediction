            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="8.113" offset="32392">Well, this case comes to us from the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.241" offset="48901">The respondent, Atkins, is a private physician under contract with the State of North Carolina to provide orthopedic services at a state prison hospital on a part-time basis and he treated the petitioner for a leg injury sustained while the petitioner was an inmate in the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.708" offset="130821">The petitioner, alleging that he was given inadequate treatment, sued the doctor in federal court under a statute we call Section 1983 for violation of his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.213" offset="200829">The Court entered summary judgment for the physician holding that he was not acting under color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.502" offset="225907">And the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.090" offset="240327">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse that judgment and remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.014" offset="264046">A physician who is under contract with the State to provide medical services to inmates at a state prison hospital acts under color of state law when he treats an inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.432" offset="313678">This result is not affected by the fact that this respondent was paid by contract rather than by salary, nor by the fact that he was not required to work exclusively for the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.795" offset="363102">It is the physician?s function within the state system and not the precise terms of his employment that is determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.220" offset="396852">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
