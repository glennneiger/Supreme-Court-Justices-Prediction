            <text syncTime="131.365" offset="645949">What we have here is a question as to whether the Paternal Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980, which is 28 US 1738A, furnishes a private cause of action in a Federal Court to determine which of two sister states' conflicting custody decrees has failed to comply with the jurisdiction requirements of what I will call the PKPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.074" offset="796832">The primary issue of all the reported cases appears to be the Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.680" offset="831209">Since there is neither an expressed jurisdiction or a prohibition against it, the question is whether there is an implied intent to give a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.705" offset="895366">Before we get to that particular point, I feel that it is appropriate to discuss the background of the PKPA, itself, in order to determine what Congressional intent was.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.401" offset="958164">First, I think we would have to recognize and discuss what the problem was as Congress saw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.625" offset="1002990">In joint hearing before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Senator Malcom Wallop stated as follows: Every year between 25,000 and 100,000 children of broken marriages are kidnapped by a parent attempting forcibly to obtain custody over a child living with the other one.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.228" offset="1121482">The emotional cost of child snatching which must be borne in large measure by young persons who have already watched their parents' marriage fail and their family split asunder is overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.087" offset="1184907">What the Congress saw was 25,000 to 100,000 cases of people who were unhappy with custody decrees of one state taking the children from that state and fleeing to other states and obtaining custody decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.269" offset="1281560">In that situation, there was either no enforcement or little enforcement due to the cost involved in travelling to the new state.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.696" offset="1339343">These are real problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.779" offset="1347598">In my case, my client hasn't seen his son in seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.266" offset="1369541">This Court had a case similar to this on a different legal issue in front of it last term: the Samolian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.924" offset="1416247">And that case brought to this Court the issue was a writ of extradition which the California Supreme Court did not honor, the writ being issued by the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.433" offset="1478210">The rationale given by the Supreme Court of California was that there could not have been a criminal act because Mr. Samolian, who was a public defender... a deputy public defender, excuse me, in San Bernadino, had a valid California custody order.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.812" offset="1543725">This Court held that the writ of extradition had to be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.818" offset="1575803">And Mr. Samolian now is free from the Louisiana Court on a $20,000 bond and faces a criminal trial in less than two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.558" offset="1626794">This is the type of issue that Congress wanted to address and wanted to solve.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.331" offset="2165857">As I recall, the lower court just summarily dismissed it saying that there was no jurisdiction whatsoever because it was within a domestic relation exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.341" offset="2229910">And the court, the Ninth Circuit Court held that there was no implied intent on Congress to create a Federal cause of action and further held that the domestic relation exception was involved herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.670" offset="2311203">Those were the two holdings of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.289" offset="2321652">The next thing that I think should be looked at is what did Congress do or what approach did they take once they defined the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.035" offset="2404616">Quoting Senator McGovern in the Congressional Record at Senate page 758 on January 23, 1979, he states that the PK will cause all states will be required to enforce with very few modifications allowed the custody decree of the state that jurisdiction according to the provisions of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.555" offset="2526765">And, at present, a parent can take a child, flee to another state and begin court proceedings in that state to regain custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.661" offset="2563127">For several reasons, custody is usually granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.112" offset="2576920">States treasure their independence to make such decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.064" offset="2588727">The other parent is not present to make the case and the absconding parent may be surrounded by supporters willing to testify on his or on her behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.539" offset="2626657">Under this bill, the kidnapping parent could not be granted custody of the children by any other state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.110" offset="2652989">This provision would serve a possible childnapper from taking the child across state lines as there would be no hope of gaining custody of the child in another state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2141.505" offset="8686543">Under the Federal statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="kenneth_rigby" startTime="2142.689" stopTime="3393.419">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth Rigby</label>
            <text syncTime="2142.689" offset="8691245">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.405" offset="8694171">And Congress specifically intended, we submit, from the very exhaustive legislative history, that PKPA, that the onus of enforcement of PKPA be placed on the state courts, not the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.383" offset="8758014">If I may, very briefly: There were seven factors that have been outlined which I believe all Members of this Court agree upon in one way or the other with respect to discerning Congressional intent in this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.214" offset="8845367">And that is Congress' perception of the law it was shaping or reshaping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.368" offset="8865952">Secondly, the problem which Congress perceived that was not being adequately addressed by that law, the language of the statute, itself, the legislative history of the statute, the likelihood that Congress intended to supercede or to supplement existing remedies and whether implication of a Federal cause of action is required to accomplish Congress' purpose in enacting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.387" offset="8986115">The state of the law was this, as Congress perceived it, as shown exhaustively by the legislative history that this Court had not definitively ruled whether or not custody cases were subject to full faith and credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.913" offset="9048182">States had commenced adopting UCCJA, Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, on a voluntary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.537" offset="9090710">At the time the Federal legislation was originally suggested, only about 19 of the states had adopted the Uniform Act and the states that had not adopted the Act were still in the language of the legislative history, havens for child snatchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.701" offset="9171376">As the PKPA progressed through Congressional hearings, more and more states adopted UCCJA so that at the time of the adoption of PKPA, nearly all the states had adopted UCCJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.096" offset="9252878">Now, all have adopted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.316" offset="9265834">So, Congress was looking at this legislative history and they were concerned about states that had not adopted UCCJA being admittedly havens for child snatchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.409" offset="9326125">Secondly, the language of the statute, itself, as the full faith and credit statute, itself, provides is directed not at parties but, in this instance, directed at the appropriate state authorities, not courts, as in full faith and credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.740" offset="9407523">All of the language of PKPA is directed at state authorities and what they shall and they shall not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.928" offset="9448274">The statutory scheme was this: Originally, it was proposed to exempt parental kidnapping from the Lindberg Kidnapping statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.919" offset="9500205">Congress reacted to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.271" offset="9509609">The Federal courts should not be in Federal parental kidnapping cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.227" offset="9541478">The Wallop proposal came along originally with three proposals: (1) to impose Federal jurisdictional standards on the state in custody cases; (2) to make the Parent Locator Service, the Federal Parent Locator Service available not to parties, but the language says to the states, make the Federal Locator Service available to the states to locate kidnapping parents and kidnapped children; and (3) was to make it a Federal offense to kidnap your child in violation of a proper court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.692" offset="9727261">The third prong is the one that received most of the attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.595" offset="9750876">All the courts and the legislative history is full of the letter from Assistant Attorney General Wald in which the Justice Department opposed it, the FBI opposed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.236" offset="9801449">HEW opposed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.271" offset="9809599">They did not want the Federal courts involved in, to this extent, in this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.544" offset="9854739">So, it was as the sponsors time and time again talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.465" offset="9878354">A delicate balance between solving a problem which was a legitimate Federal interest and a minimum of Federal intervention in what is traditionally a pure state affair: custody cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.278" offset="9953586">The Federal judiciary does not want to be involved, nor should it be involved in custody cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.698" offset="9979291">So, a committee, the final resolution was that instead of the third prong of the three-pronged legislation being a Federal offense that the Federal Fugitive Act would be made applicable to cases in which a child was taken by a parent from one state to another state in violation of a proper custody award ended in accordance with PKPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.009" offset="10144594">So that under the Federal statute, the party could be brought back and prosecuted under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.698" offset="10175314">So, as the sponsors themselves said, not in connection with the rejection of the Fish Amendment, which is a different proposition, in which Senator Cranston, for example, said: By reserving the Federal role to the creation of a Federal Parent Locator Service and FBI investigation after a sufficient lapse of time, we hold Federal interference to a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.121" offset="10320972">And it is very clear from an extensive legislative history that right or wrong, that Congress deliberately, made a deliberate decision to limit the Federal interference in the process to these two things: making the use of the Federal Parent Locator Service, which at that time was available only for child support purposes, not custody purposes, and, secondly, to permit the use of the Federal Fugitive statute in custody cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.381" offset="10490037">Professor Coombs, who wrote most of this legislation and assisted a great deal in its formulation, said that the legislation in it shows respect for the proper division of roles between the state and the Federal Government and between civil and criminal approaches to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.682" offset="10591287">In the exchange between Mr. Conyers and Representative Fish, who had introduced a bill... there were two bills pending, to confer diversity jurisdiction on Federal District Courts in custody cases so that a Federal District Court could enforce a valid custody award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.266" offset="10705599">And in that exchange, the differing approaches and the deliberate Congressional restraint is very obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.557" offset="10746768">Mr. Conyers, actually Mr. Bennett, that's PKPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.961" offset="10772368">Mr. Bennett would impose the obligation on state courts and you would require Federal courts to give full faith and credit to the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.269" offset="10817612">And, again, we would be imposing the responsibility of the enforcement upon the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.791" offset="10851676">Now, what could be clearer with respect to Congressional intent when the... when Congress is presented with the contrary proposal that Federal courts be granted... I grant you it was not Federal question jurisdiction, but diversity jurisdiction, and they expressly rejected it saying at the same time: It is our purpose to impose the enforcement of PKPA on the state courts, not the Federal courts, as you, Mr. Fish, would have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.452" offset="11018337">And in the statutory scheme to explicitly limit the Federal participation to the use of Federal Parent Locator Service and the use of the Federal Fugitive Act for the purposes of doing what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.817" offset="11115826">To assist the states in their enforcement of PKPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.439" offset="11146233">To allow them, when they have issued a valid custody decree under the PKPA Federal standards to go to the Federal Parent Locator Service and request that the kidnapping parent and the abducted child be located and when located to then be able to have the FBI to bring the abducting parent back for prosecution in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.994" offset="11276532">And that whole statutory scheme is obvious in the legislative history of PKPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.666" offset="11319163">Nowhere, I suggest, did... has any commentator or court said that the state courts have not done their... performed their constitutional duty in enforcing the Full Faith and Credit Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.781" offset="11403696">And this is a form of full faith and credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.650" offset="11419160">It is an addendum to full faith and credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.185" offset="11429296">Congress, many years ago, made a deliberate decision that the implementing statute to the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Federal Constitution would impose the obligation of enforcing the acts, statutes and so forth of another state on the state judicial systems, not on the Federal judicial system and this Court and the other courts on many occasions have concurred in that deliberate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.573" offset="11562834">The decision of Congress in PKPA is the same kind of careful deliberate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.279" offset="11597629">That there was a problem that needed to be addressed by the Federal legislative branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.618" offset="11635036">And it addressed it in a very careful and a very deliberate and a very balancing manner between the Federal intervention and what is traditionally a state... you know, just uniquely a state problem, custody is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.881" offset="11720091">It is... not just traditionally, but by its very nature is a state problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.154" offset="11749139">And Congress has made that very deliberate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.558" offset="11778710">What happens if Federal courts get involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.112" offset="11796995">It has been suggested by Flood v. Bratton, which is the Third Circuit case that holds there is Federal jurisdiction, that Federal courts need not get involved in the underlying custody issues in order to resolve conflicting jurisdictional assertions by states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.827" offset="11895843">I suggest that that may reflect not a sophisticated understanding of custody cases because as has been pointed out by the District of Columbia Circuit in their very recent Rogers v. Platt, that is the very thing the District Court in the District of Columbia had to do in order to resolve a conflict between the District of Columbia court and a California state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.532" offset="12022693">It had to determine factual issues that go to the question of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.702" offset="12047353">In the present case, Louisiana recognized and enforced the California decree but suspended the visitation rights of Dr. Thompson because of physical cruelty by Dr. Thompson to his son occurring in Louisiana during the exercise of a visitation privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.985" offset="12144424">That is permissible both under UCCJA and PKPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.157" offset="12177129">Professor Coombs, whom I have quoted in my brief on the subject, says there is concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.160" offset="12205132">Whether there is jurisdiction or not jurisdiction in Louisiana in this case is going to depend upon whether Dr. Thompson did what we claimed he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.154" offset="12253093">And, therefore, whether Louisiana correctly exercised jurisdiction under what has been called the Emergency Provisions of both UCCJA and PKPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.295" offset="12305652">So, courts aren't necessarily going to get involved in the underlying, undergirding factual issues with reference to custody in order to determine which court has jurisdiction under PKPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.923" offset="12380257">Another consideration is... and I have asserted it in brief and assert it, again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.795" offset="12411709">This honorable Court's decision in Webb v. Webb and its thoughtful analysis of why state remedies ought to be exhausted before this Court is called upon to resolve Federal issues in what are basically state causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.978" offset="12504391">Questions of comity, maintenance of a delicate balance between Federal and state judicial systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.500" offset="12538559">And, more importantly, the opportunity for state courts to perform their duty and the suggestion that state courts, as a system, will not perform their constitutional duty, I think is reprehensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.760" offset="12607523">There is no suggestion in this case that Louisiana courts will not perform their duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.198" offset="12633332">In fact, I have cited a case in which I lost under almost the identical facts in which a state court enforced PKPA to my client's detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.023" offset="12688607">Louisiana courts will do their duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.708" offset="12695398">State courts will do their constitutional duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.427" offset="12710236">The opportunity for state courts to develop the record, the Court of Appeal in this case footnotes time after time the incomplete nature of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.651" offset="12759137">And the state courts ought to have the opportunity to develop the record, to decide, for example, the case on a non-Federal ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.292" offset="12809710">These cases are quite frequently decided by state courts on non-Federal grounds: not PKPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.898" offset="12840117">A state court may say: Under our version of UCCJA, we have no jurisdiction to modify a Texas decree or a New Jersey decree and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.689" offset="12891317">And the matter will never get into the Federal courts because it has been decided on a state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.676" offset="12915245">All of this, of course, reduces the workload of the Federal judicial system which is a consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.616" offset="12950981">It may not be the paramount consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.685" offset="12967281">I recognize in this case that Dr. Thompson in brief has argued: It would be useless for me to go to Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.041" offset="13004688">That it is hostile territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.660" offset="13019212">I don't believe it is hostile territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.362" offset="13029975">Our courts administer justice as do the state systems of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.385" offset="13058083">And I think particularly appropriate is the opinion of this Court in Texaco, in which this Court said that it did not... when a litigant hasn't presented his Federal claims to a state court, the Federal court should assume the state procedures will afford an adequate remedy in the case... in the absence of unambiguous authority to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.070" offset="13184829">Remember, Dr. Thompson has not made the first attempt to enforce his California decree in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.010" offset="13212518">The only thing he did was try to, with an armed accomplice, come to Louisiana and try to kidnap his boy instead of following judicial procedures: bring an action on his California decree in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.054" offset="13284721">He doesn't come with great grace to say: Louisiana won't give me a fair shake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.624" offset="13315023">Until he has come to Louisiana and seen what kind of a shake that he is going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.814" offset="13347728">Secondly, Rogers v. Platt has pointed up an argument which we have advanced as to the peculiar nature of the jurisdiction asserted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.656" offset="13403108">All of the circuits that hold there is jurisdiction concede that there is no jurisdiction to enforce a state custody decree in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.547" offset="13454726">They all concede that because Congress specifically rejected that proposal, the Fish Proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.118" offset="13480953">They say that Congress intended to confer jurisdiction only when there is two conflicting state custody decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.872" offset="13516061">That is quasi-appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.092" offset="13532884">State A, State B, a Federal District Court decides which one is correct as a matter of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.614" offset="13571023">It is appellate jurisdiction of being asserted by a Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.637" offset="13599026">And at no time, with the one exception of criminal habeas corpus has Congress ever even expressly granted to Federal District Courts appellate jurisdiction over state court judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.830" offset="13663810">That appellate jurisdiction rests in this Court and this Court, alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.467" offset="13686380">Does the Court have any questions?</text>
