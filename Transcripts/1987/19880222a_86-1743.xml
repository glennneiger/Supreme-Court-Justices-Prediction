            <label>Mr. Paul A. Manion</label>
            <text syncTime="90.760" offset="497976">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.506" offset="524934">This case presents the question whether a Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas sitting in a Federal employers liability act case is free to apply State Court rules concerning the propriety of an award of prejudgment interest and the reduction of an award for impairment of future earning power to its present value, or must apply the Federal law applicable to those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.173" offset="683654">The facts relevant to this question can be stated very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.406" offset="704552">The plaintiff was injured in the course of his employment with the Monessen Southwestern Railway as a brakeman conductor.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.961" offset="738720">He was off work for about eighteen months.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.962" offset="750736">When he returned to work, he returned as a radio supply clerk, rather than as a brakeman conductor.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.519" offset="781038">He filed suit under the FELA in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County in Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.903" offset="810505">At that trial, he claimed damages first based on his lost wages to the date of trial, which approximately $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.441" offset="852718">And for impairment of his future earning power based on his claim that he would earn approximately $5,000 a year less as a radio supply clerk than he would have as a brakeman conductor for the remaining fifteen years of his expected work life.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.617" offset="953342">At the close of the evidence, counsel for the Railroad submitted a point for charge to the Court, requesting the Court to charge the jury on reducing an award for impairment of future earning power to its present value.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.210" offset="1023768">In that request, there was specifically included a reference to present worth tables of which the Court had already taken judicial notice, and which would assist the jury in making the present worth reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.992" offset="1090851">The Court denied the request stating on three separate occasions, both orally and in writing that the basis for the Court's refusal was the recently announced decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania holding that a present worth instruction should no longer be given in the Courts of the Commonwealth in personal injury cases in which claims for impairment of future earning power were asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.952" offset="1218746">The Judge made that very specific in chambers in ruling on the request for charge before she instructed the jury, then again in the charge itself, and then thirdly in her opinion on post-trial motions for judgment N.O.V. and for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.746" offset="1301920">After closing arguments of counsel and the Court's charge, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $125,000, an amount equal to the claim for lost wages to the date of trial of $50,000 and of the claim for impairment of future earning power at $5,000 a year for fifteen years, the plaintiff being fifty years of age at the date of trial and counsel arguing to the jury on behalf of the plaintiff that although it could award damages to age 70, an award based on retirement at age 65 would not be unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.185" offset="1479657">Eleven days after the jury verdict and pursuant to a motion of counsel for plaintiff and over the objection of counsel for defendant, the Judge increased the jury's verdict by adding thereto prejudgment interest at the rate of ten percent per year to increase the $125,000 to approximately $152,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.654" offset="1589580">The basis for that addition was a rule which had been promulgated by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1978, stating that in bodily injury cases tried in the Courts of the Commonwealth, such an award would be made provided that certain conditions were met.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.348" offset="1672336">That is that the defendant had not made an offer prior to trial, which was at least 75 percent of the amount which the jury ultimately returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.909" offset="1738583">That was done over the objection of the defendant.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="407.425" offset="1764601">Is the announced purpose of Rule 238 to encourage settlement in this kind of case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_a_manion" startTime="413.019" stopTime="479.990">
            <label>Mr. Paul A. Manion</label>
            <text syncTime="413.019" offset="1786962">It is, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.137" offset="1791455">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court both in this case and in Laudenberger said that its purpose was to encourage settlement to rid the courts of congested dockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.048" offset="1839102">There are serious questions as to whether that was a substantive rule within the rulemaking part of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.781" offset="1870031">It dealt with that issue within one year after the rule was promulgated, found it to be procedural but acknowledged that it had very substantial substantive implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.397" offset="1912558">And the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has found it to be substantive in the Jarvis case and therefore that a Federal Court must apply it in a case in that Court based on diversity of citizenship because of its substantial substantive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.269" offset="1984029">But the articulated reason by the Court in justifying the rule was that it was within its rulemaking powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.476" offset="2020810">Of course, the Court had to justify it on that basis because otherwise it would have been found to have not been validly promulgated.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="479.990" offset="2054874">But Pennsylvania doesn't say prejudgment interest is awarded as a matter of right to a prevailing plaintiff; it's only where there was a failure to submit an offer of a particular kind by the defendant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_a_manion" startTime="492.299" stopTime="832.705">
            <label>Mr. Paul A. Manion</label>
            <text syncTime="492.299" offset="2104088">Yes, Your Honor, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.151" offset="2111507">It's not an absolute rule, there is one condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.655" offset="2121538">And I should, to bring the Court up to date, there was the Craig decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which came down between the Superior Court and Supreme Court decision in this case which said that there were questions of due process raised by the rule in that the defendant may not have been at fault for the delay, and therefore in cases after Craig where this issue came up, there would have to be a hearing following the verdict and a determination made.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.425" offset="2248598">But within the last month, the Court announced in Craig that its procedural rules committee was instructed to come up with a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.092" offset="2279318">The new rule as promulgated in the Pennsylvania Bulletin on February 6th, which will take effect in a month and a half, in essence provides that as long as no offer has been made that upon the jury verdict, there will be an award of prejudgment interest unless the defendant files a motion affirmatively establishing that the plaintiff was the cause of at least some of the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.800" offset="2386106">Except for those conditions, Your Honor, that rule was applied uniformly.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.904" offset="2406586">It was applied uniformly before Craig, in the interval after Craig before the Supreme Court Procedural Rules Committee came out with the suggested new rule, and it's being applied every day in the Courts of the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.814" offset="2458204">As Justice Hutchinson pointed out in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, there can be no question that this rule has a substantial effect on damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.911" offset="2494567">In this case, it increased the award by at least 20 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.444" offset="2508673">That gets me to the point that the first question really in many respects this case perhaps more than coincidentally is being argued on the 50th anniversary by only a few days of this Court's decision in Erie Railroad v. Tompkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.360" offset="2604385">As Your Honors will recall, that case involved the question whether a Federal court, hearing a case based on its diversity jurisdiction which arose solely under State law was free to apply its own general version of what the common law should be, or was obliged to apply State law as construed by the Courts of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.957" offset="2714727">And of course, Justice Brandeis' classic opinion and landmark in the field of federal-state relations said that the Federal court would have to defer to State law, not because of any notion of superiority or inferiority between the two systems of courts, but because of the fundamental precept.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.783" offset="2806051">First that the law to be applied to a claim should be the law out of which the claim arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.680" offset="2845652">Secondly, the fostering of any other rule would lead to chaos as it has in Pennsylvania because the Third Circuit justice declared last August that you cannot apply prejudgment interest in an FELA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.732" offset="2917855">So that litigants in Pittsburgh under a Statute the principal purpose... or at least one of the primary purposes of which was to provide for a national uniformity for railroad workers across the country, not only are we getting different results between one state and another, but in Pittsburgh, you will get a substantially different result depending upon whether you file your suit at 7th and Grant in the Federal Court where you won't get prejudgment interest, or up the street at 4th and Grant, where you'll get an award of at least 20 percent in this case, substantially enlarging the damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.225" offset="3103847">It's clear that Federal law has to be applied here, not because the Federal Courts are superior to the State Courts, but this is a Federal Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.160" offset="3143553">It cries out for national uniformity and enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.113" offset="3159331">And it can't be justified on the ground of a substantive procedural distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.157" offset="3191514">This Court has long held in FELA cases starting at least in 1916 in the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad v. Kelly case the question of the proper measure of damages is inseparably connected with the right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.069" offset="3263194">And in cases arising under the FELA, it must be settled according to general principles of law as administered in the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.865" offset="3298407">Eight years ago in the Liepelt case, Justice Stevens said, it has long been settled that questions concerning the measure of damages in an FELA action are Federal in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.475" offset="3352846">And Justice Blackmun in dissent stating that income tax instructions the question whether they should be given is an incidental matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.700" offset="3389731">Perhaps we should defer to State procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.352" offset="3400284">But he said, of course, I assume that if this procedural rule has substantive impact... as it does in our case... regardless of how the State labels its rule, it's got to give way to Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.338" offset="4380294">That's the clear air in this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.680" offset="4389698">Regardless of what's done here, the Judge did it on the basis of a State rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.643" offset="4437450">That is, would such an award be consistent with Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.126" offset="4459393">On that question, that has to be resolved against the plaintiff, because when the FELA was adopted in 1908, Congress took the state of the common law as it then existed with respect to tort claims for personal injuries and adopted in Section 1 a rule that provided that FELA plaintiffs would be awarded damages for injuries sustained as a result of the negligence of the employer, how slight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.475" offset="4576839">Prejudgment interest existed at common law in 1908, but it was permitted only in liquidated damages claims for breach of contract or other situations where the damages were liquidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.344" offset="4628353">It was never permitted in personal injury cases where the damages were unliquidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.519" offset="4649042">Congress saw fit to abolish the common law rule under which contributory negligence was an absolute bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.915" offset="4682583">It said that it will not be an absolute bar; comparative negligence will be the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.319" offset="4708183">In Section 3, the very same section in which it did that, it said, moreover, contributory negligence will not be any defense where the injury arises from a violation of the Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.586" offset="4761264">In 1939, all the while we have hundreds of cases going up through the Federal courts and the State courts, none of which allows prejudgment interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.093" offset="4887278">Not one court has ever said that prejudgment interest is authorized until the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1211.712" offset="4981737">When you take the state of the law at the time of the adoption of the FELA, Congress' deliberate decisions which aspects of common law it would do away with and which it would incorporate in this admittedly liberal statute, which this Court has consistently construed as broadening liability but has never held that you can get prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.167" offset="5071598">The state of the law at that time, the 80 years of precedent, Congress all the while acting on this Statute, amending it when it felt appropriate, never adopting a rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.288" offset="6864121">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.801" offset="6878122">We're considering here today the application to a remedial statute, the Federal Employers Liability Act of two of what have become the most important cornerstones in the past decade of the civil practice in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.961" offset="6938727">Rule 238 about which there's already been some discussion, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision in Kaczkowski v. Bolubasz which has straightened up, at least for the time being, some very curious developments in how we reduce verdicts for impairment of earning capacity and other future payments to present value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.834" offset="7018243">I can't help but make this comment, that Rule 238 being designed to reduce congestion and delay which was the avowed purpose of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in promulgating it, if my colleague for the railroad is correct, may do more to reduce the backlog in Federal Court because it will attract litigants down Grant Street to the State Court where their possibility of getting Rule 238 exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.292" offset="7120121">But nonetheless, it's the kind of rule... about which I'll speak later... that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court should be permitted to promulgate to deal with the matter of the disposition of the cases in its system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.090" offset="7175291">I would like to first however discuss the total offset method that was used to reduce the verdict in this case to present worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.787" offset="7210087">The trial court tried this case in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.051" offset="7243105">For a long period of time, since this Court's decision in Chesapeake &amp; Ohio v. Kelly in 1916, announcing that future payments in FELA cases, and for that matter, it has affected the fabric of all litigation involving future payments and especially personal injury litigation, must be reduced to present value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.168" offset="7335579">This Court in 1916 expressly did not lay down a precise rule or formula for how that reduction was to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.045" offset="7391063">And said it was not its purpose to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.597" offset="7401303">Thereafter then until the decision of this Court through Justice Stevens in 1983 in the Pfeifer case, a period of 67 years, the State courts and the Federal courts across this country used a wide variety of methods to reduce future impairment of earning capacity to present value, all with at least the tacit approval of this Court, because this Court let that go on for 67 years, and, I submit, should continue to let it go on because we're talking about methods of proof and how you handled methods of proof, evidentiary questions in trial courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.353" offset="7556366">In 1980, in this context, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania said that they wanted this evidentiary rule based on the theory that the market interest rate offsets the inflation rate and that therefore we will consider those totally offset and those issues will not be entertained for evidentiary purposes, and that proposal will not be submitted to the jury that the reduction to present worth will have taken effect in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.991" offset="7670887">That was to remedy an inequity that has been pointed out in a number of the circuit courts to which the appellant refers in which we had a situation where you could not introduce inflationary evidence at all and still had a discount to present worth which was essentially a double discount for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.785" offset="7750090">And I should add, all of this is in the context of what I submit is an economically inequitable process where you get nothing for delay in an FELA case under ordinary circumstances, and when all rules of the court are complied with, up through until the time of trial even though economic loss has occurred, but that future damages are discounted, which is an economically inequitable circumstance.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1928.521" offset="7849042">You should make that argument to Congress when it enacted the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.054" offset="7863148">I mean, Congress did make that judgment, didn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_hollander" startTime="1934.107" stopTime="2182.418">
            <label>Mr. Thomas Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="1934.107" offset="7871402">Well, Your Honor, I'm glad you raised that, because Congress... and we're talking now about prejudgment interest, I take it, is what your question is... Congress said nothing about prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.417" offset="7924588">And in an inference that a Court made many many years ago, and not this Court, the inference was that Congress' silence in 1908 meant there would be no prejudgment interest permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.495" offset="7980908">In 1908, there was neither prejudgment nor post-judgment interest in this country, as I read these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.902" offset="8018524">So the fact that there was no interest at all mentioned was deemed therefore without any discussion nor reference to the Congressional Record, it's questionable whether Congress considered it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.369" offset="8060425">But what Congress did consider at that time, and an examination of the Congressional Record will show... and I would like to refer the Court... and it's not in my brief, but I will read it into the argument... Congressional Record 60th Congress First Session, Vol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.069" offset="8127194">42 in 1908, at pages 4527 to 4550, discussed the reasons for granting concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.838" offset="8170243">Justice Holmes in 1916, which was apparently a banner year for litigation in this Court for FELA cases, referred to the fact that the Congress was to anticipate... I'll give you his words, which I think are pertinent here...</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.494" offset="8268882">"that Congress contemplated suits in State courts and accepted State procedures in advance. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.000" offset="8294900">In that case there was a question about a lien on an FELA claim by a local lawyer and the question that there couldn't be a lien because Congress hadn't allowed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.455" offset="8328754">Oddly enough, about that same time, this Court affirmed a State court addition of ten percent in an FELA case in an appeal because the appeal was affirmed and the defendant had to add ten percent to the award on that basis which is coincidentally the same interest rate we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.186" offset="8399703">Congress was concerned when it granted concurrent jurisdiction with the access of injured railroaders to the courts in 1908 and the sizes of the Federal Districts and the circuits, the question of how far people had to travel, how they'd get their witnesses to court if it were a Federal Court matter, and whether that imposed a great burden on the litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.312" offset="8488206">And Congress considered and determined not to grant removal powers to a defendant in an FELA case because of the costs and the denial of adequate access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.402" offset="8548496">That was in 1908.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.914" offset="8554557">I submit, Your Honors, that at this time in 1988, the denial to access of the litigants injured in railroad cases and in any other cases to the courts, is now the delay and congestion that's occurring which is equally significant to the costs that would be incurred in the long distance travels and the transportation and hiring of lawyers in two or more locations in 1908.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.161" offset="8651523">In short, the economic burdens that are placed on the plaintiffs now in the delays means that their verdicts are less valuable and have less meaning and are more costly in personal loss over the long run than they would be with the use of prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.173" offset="8723621">So I think that Congress has actually spoken to this issue, but not talking about interest, talking about access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.988" offset="8750893">And that because this Court has said that the FELA is a dynamic statute to be liberally construed and in the words of the Kernan decision, not a static remedy but one enlarged and developed to meet changing conditions and concepts over a period of time, suggests clearly that this is not a Congressional matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.054" offset="8839187">Congress remains silent on interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.377" offset="8852457">it remains silent on damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2226.480" offset="9040852">And what in effect happens if a prejudgment interest rule occurs and if that impacts on the formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.305" offset="9084111">There are because of the concurrent jurisdiction of this Statute, a number, a wide variety of things that effect uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.071" offset="9119220">Up until the amendment of the Section 1961 of the Code, all post-judgment interest in Federal courts were controlled by State rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.181" offset="9171674">That varied a great deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.231" offset="9175853">Verdict sizes vary from region to region.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.463" offset="9188810">Jury sizes vary from district court to State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.285" offset="9204065">The nature of the verdicts, whether they're a majority or whether they're five-sixths, or unanimous varies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.609" offset="9225381">Present worth calculations have varied from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.781" offset="9238025">Pleadings are different, provisions are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.904" offset="9254534">Does Rule 238 really create a disparity in the treatment of FELA claimants?</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.929" offset="9286612">And my response to that is not unlike what I was trying to get to in response to Justice Scalia's question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2295.535" offset="9317019">Prejudgment interest is a just economic concept.</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.460" offset="11524784">--I think that Congress did not preclude it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.249" offset="11531889">I think Congress, in its debates, concerning the Statute, did not address that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.054" offset="11559161">I think that Congress' concern about access to courts and the fact that lay damages reduces the validity and the fairness of the awards is consistent with the award of prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.314" offset="11604196">So if I may for a moment return to the total offset point that we were discussing earlier, the question that was raised earlier during the railroad's argument concerning whether it believed the jury should make the determination of the method of selection is one that I would like to comment on briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.818" offset="11694162">Because, interestingly enough, that would assume that the Pfeifer decision of Justice Stevens and this Court in 1983 applies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.164" offset="11731569">Amicus curiae, in its brief, indicates that Pfeifer does not apply to this case, although the railroad takes the position that it does, or at least it has taken that position up to now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.434" offset="11776709">The question that comes up with regard to Pfeifer is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.498" offset="11800950">When it was decided in 1983, it gave council to the courts and lawyers across the country that there were a number of methods that were appropriate to use in FELA cases, or in that case, I'm sorry, in 5(b) Longshoremen Harbor Workers Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.851" offset="11870331">In that regard, Justice Stevens said that the total offset method that Pennsylvania has adopted has the virtue of simplicity and may even be economically precise, which we take it really to be quite an endorsement of that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.602" offset="11937309">Because in that opinion, the discussion is that trying to approximately impaired earning capacity by reduction to present worth is a kind of rough and ready process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.341" offset="11980255">And if this one has some economic precision, it would be of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.793" offset="11994047">What the Court said, however, was that a deliberate choice must be made, and it remanded the case to the District Court sitting in Pittsburgh and said, you don't have to reopen the record, but take a look at what's gone on here, and then consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.431" offset="12056637">But in Dickerson decided by this Court in 1985, the Court restated the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio v. Kelly holding and again selected no single method as did the Kelly Court, the same thing, and said with regard to what the lower Court should do in Missouri was to require that whatever method is used, that it take into account inflation, other sources of wage increases and the rate of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.732" offset="12169904">At that point, the Court said, nothing was done in Missouri, the Missouri Court ignored the entire question of reduction to present worth, and as a result, there was no reduction to present worth in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.370" offset="12220372">And it was sent back to require an instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.812" offset="12234165">In the case before this Court now, I submit to you that Kelly, Pfeifer and Dickerson have been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.128" offset="12275438">As a matter of fact, I submit to you that the Pennsylvania Courts have slavishly followed the reduction to present worth requirements of Federal law in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.864" offset="12310338">First of all, there was a reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.616" offset="12321414">The record is clear that the reduction was in conformity with the Pennsylvania decision on using the total offset method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.631" offset="12349417">Amicus, in its brief, admits that there was a reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.882" offset="12362478">And what's the question then?</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.455" offset="12368748">Whether there was a reduction or whether there should be an instruction for a reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.318" offset="12384212">And it's obvious that the reduction is the bottom line and the important part of the element of damages.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="3067.043" offset="12403125">Well, the jury was not instructed that it had to make a reduction or that it had t calculate present worth.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="3074.198" offset="12431755">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.597" offset="12433322">What the jury was instructed was that the Court was going to take care of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.780" offset="12450041">It was an admonition essentially to the jury not to do anything about inflation and not to do anything about reduction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3086.917" stopTime="3094.924">
            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="3086.917" offset="12482642">Well, do you suppose that Dickerson requires at least that the jury be told they have to base damages on present worth?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_hollander" startTime="3094.924" stopTime="3324.206">
            <label>Mr. Thomas Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="3094.924" offset="12514616">Your Honor, the jury was told that their award would essentially have a reduced worth implication because of what the Court told them it was doing with regard to the use of the total offset method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.160" offset="12559546">The net effect is that there is a reduction to present worth but the jury doesn't have to calculate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.134" offset="12583474">So what I think happened in this case, as a matter of fact, based on the figures that were cited to you by counsel is the jury may well have reduced it twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.792" offset="12622136">After the Court did it by the total offset method, and then when it went out to the jury room to deliberate because if in fact the jury followed the instructions of the Court, and if the defendant's contention that all of the balance of the verdict of the $125,000 less the $50,000 lost income was true, there would have been no award for pain and suffering and the other elements of emotional distress that are part of the award, and the jury would have then disobeyed the Court's orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.282" offset="12736029">I submit to you that what the jury did was give less than even the total offset method would have provided for in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.888" offset="12766436">After that... and by the way, I should also say that the Judge did make a selection as the Pfeifer case was suggesting the non-jury district court case should be done and that was between the total offset method which the plaintiffs were prepared to submit and the position that the defendant took in a request for instructions that essentially would have caused a double discount because the Court had not entertained evidence concerning inflation in accordance with Kaczkowski.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.917" offset="12870612">It instructed the jury on the income tax considerations required by this Court in the Leipelt case and then when the Pfeifer decision came down, which was after the trial of this case and the decision of the post-trial motion by the trial judge, the Pennsylvania Superior Court asked for supplemental briefs concerning the Pfeifer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.949" offset="12950756">The Pennsylvania Superior Court then did with a three-judge panel evaluate the record and appraise it to determine whether the total offset method as the Pfeifer opinion had required was the appropriate method to use for a railroad worker in Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.452" offset="13024735">The Superior Court could have remanded the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.875" offset="13038423">It kept it and said, we looked at it, we think it's appropriate and they affirmed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.757" offset="13053992">And then the Supreme Court, which had previously gone through the agonizing appraisal of the various methods to select the total offset method, affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.964" offset="13086802">As an officer of the Court... and I'll be brief in this regard... I would like to make one comment concerning the Pfeifer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.579" offset="13125254">And that is, under it, if it is to apply in State courts and if it is to apply in jury cases, which we submit it should not be extended to, then we need some guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.710" offset="13185754">And we need guidance because of the very question that Justice O'Connor asked, do you expect this to go to juries, and if so, how do you go about doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.528" offset="13229012">This Court said in the Pfeifer case, we don't want seminars on economics in the court room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.463" offset="13248761">We don't have to bring in all of the expert witnesses to talk about actuarial information, economic information and what methods are better and what methods are worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.440" offset="13280735">And then to introduce evidence of how to implement them in the trial of a personal injury case of a railroader.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.605" offset="13301319">It becomes time consuming and exorbitant and would add seriously to congestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.560" offset="13321172">If it is to be applied in cases like this, then I ask that it be done prospectively with some consideration given to some clarification because obviously the railroad has a belief that we submit is inconsistent with Pfeifer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.171" offset="13383657">In short... and I see that my time is up... there are... there was a reduction to present worth in this case in compliance with Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.681" offset="13749685">Your Honor, to answer Justice Stevens' last question, part of the delay in the appellate courts was that the Superior Court, on suggestion of counsel, delayed its decision or consideration pending Pfeifer which had been granted cert. So that about two years of it was because of Pfeifer because of the thought that it might have some impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.619" offset="13849368">Justice O'Connor, to address again your present value question, it's our position that Dickerson controls and that as Your Honor suggested, the Court must charge on present value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.187" offset="13899628">What we say is that this Court, even assuming it were a Court decision, a deliberate choice of the Court as Justice Stevens' language suggests concerning that there must be a deliberate choice, no such deliberate choice was made in this case by the court, by the jury or anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.530" offset="13981025">You can't read this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.553" offset="13989176">When Judge Finkelhor said in chambers, we have reached the decision not to give the present worth charge, and the basis for it is, Chief Justice Nix's decision in Bolubasz, it's clear that it was, as Your Honor Justice Stevens said in Pfeifer, blind adherence to State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.508" offset="14076947">It wasn't a deliberate choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.438" offset="14084679">She said it three times, once in writing in her post-judgment opinion, and twice, once in chambers and then when she charged the jury, you don't have to bother to make this reduction any more because there's a recent decision, the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.681" offset="14157613">To say that that was a deliberate choice, as Justice Hutchinson pointed out, is to defy the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.106" offset="14183318">Your Honor, it is the choice of the fact finder, because like any issue, you're dealing with economics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.901" offset="14210485">And we don't have to call economists in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.261" offset="14219994">You do it the way the Court suggested 70 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.904" offset="14234518">You have present value tables in which the jury makes the determination of what rate is appropriate and the tables indicate what you award based on the years out into the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.734" offset="14281851">Just as you use life expectancy tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.877" offset="14290420">What we're suggesting would actually do away with economists in terms of their need in these kinds of cases because--</text>

            <text syncTime="3569.790" offset="14414136">No decent plaintiff's lawyer doesn't say, if he was making this much and it increased this much each year, probably most of which was attributable to inflation or cost of living, that you can do that into the future.</text>
