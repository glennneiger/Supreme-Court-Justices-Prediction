            <text syncTime="12.558" offset="183957">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.426" offset="195451">The reason the Petitioner chose Mr. Iredale as his attorney in this case was best stated by the trial judge, who said</text>
            <text syncTime="23.163" offset="226380">"were I in his position, I would want Mr. Iredale representing me, too, because he did a fantastic job in the prior trial and I can fully understand why he wanted him as his attorney. "</text>
            <text syncTime="40.458" offset="295552">This case turns on the question of right to counsel of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.445" offset="311539">I would suggest that it's a disqualification issue clear and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.731" offset="328675">The issue is presented where all parties waived any potential conflict, and the question decided here was the question as to the timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.539" offset="371934">The timing in this case was that the attorney following basically the guidelines of Cuyler v. Sullivan entered the case at the time he could, when he disposed of the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.946" offset="417492">When the second guilty plea was entered, he indicated I am now going... I am retained by this defendant who has seen my superior trial skills and wants me.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.118" offset="458243">He has his independent attorney, this is not someone else, the attorney knows of the performance and says we want him.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.039" offset="485933">The trial judge says, when presented initially with it, if the clients have no problem and the prosecutor has no problem, I see no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.997" offset="529714">At this time, the prosecutor said we don't plan to call this person as a witness, but there is a potential, a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.185" offset="566494">No time previously was this individual considered as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.923" offset="585407">The following Monday, a written objection is filed to the appearance of this attorney because (1) he would not be involved, Gomez-Barajas would not be involved, but now there's other person who wasn't going to be a witness will now be a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.914" offset="641413">That witness would provide no adverse information against the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.885" offset="661266">That witness would provide adverse information and substantiate the Government's principal witness that he was a large-scale dope dealer because, in fact, he did deliver marijuana to this individual's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.727" offset="712675">The key question was, did that marijuana get to the Petitioner's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.362" offset="731170">The answer was there was no showing in the record, and the Government just assumed that that connection was sufficient to knock out counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.618" offset="764189">I think it's also important to note in this case is the District Court finding, and these things are so critical for, I think, an appellate tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.641" offset="796267">In this case, the Court said based on the representations of the Government, so there was no factual finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.645" offset="828346">It was assumed that what the Government presented in its written papers were sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.532" offset="843915">Second, I have no choice but to file... find irreconcilable conflict, not a discretionary, a balancing of the issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.083" offset="1062089">The arrangement as to the non-marijuana charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.035" offset="1073897">That is to say, the other charges and the Government's representation was that, gee whiz, if that fell apart, Mr. Wheat might be a possible witness against Mr. Gomez-Barajas, and on that record, we have flatly contradicted by the assertions of Mr. Iredale that there is no way he could be a witness in that transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1441.307" offset="5899026">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.342" offset="5911147">The absolute position taken by Petitioner is that he has an unqualified right to waive any conflicts of interest arising out of multiple representation stemming from the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.435" offset="5971542">Now, we acknowledge at the outset that a criminal defendant in most cases has a right to choose any lawyer he wants, but that right does not stem from the Sixth Amendment, and it's an inherently qualified right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.945" offset="6029534">It is not like the right to counsel or the right to self-representation which must be enforced directly by the Court in every serious criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.568" offset="6072062">Now, the right to choose your counsel is inherently subject to a number of significant qualifications which Petitioner ignores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.273" offset="6106857">For example, the lawyer one would choose may be unwilling to represent you or his fees may be too high or he may have other commitments which conflict with the court's schedule and make him unable to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.166" offset="6158370">He may not be admitted to the bar of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.566" offset="6167983">He may be a lay man or a disbarred attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.618" offset="6180209">All these sorts of reasons can limit to some extent the defendant's choice of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.391" offset="6211346">It is also limited by the existence of certain serious conflicts of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.460" offset="6231618">These conflicts can be very many types.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.079" offset="6242066">For example, the lawyer he wants may be a former prosecutor who, while he was working for the Government, was involved in the same criminal matter or the lawyer may have been retained by third parties with interests adverse to that defendant or he may be a fact witness at the trial or implicated in the same criminal conduct with which the defendant is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.378" offset="6343213">Courts have universally held that under those circumstances, the conflicts of interest override the defendant's right to choose his counsel and permits disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.920" offset="6385426">Now, the most common of these types of conflicts arises in cases where one lawyer represents more than one defendant in a given criminal case, and Rule 44(c) was designed to deal with that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.929" offset="6445508">States that... the District Court has to inquire into every instance of multiple representation, and take such actions as may be appropriate unless there's good cause to believe that no conflicts are likely to develop at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.939" offset="6509456">The Rule 44(c) does not itself state what actions, what measures might be appropriate if conflicts are likely to arise, but the advisory committee note to the rule makes clear that disqualification of counsel is legitimate option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.084" offset="6586047">The dangers created by multiple representation that Rule 44(c) is designed to address is primarily centered around the fact as noted during the previous argument that the interest of the two defendants may diverge at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.545" offset="6655951">Disparity of evidence in one... between the defendants may require the lawyer to forego presenting a witness or making an argument or taking other action that would help one of his clients at the expense of the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.874" offset="6937237">So, no other counsel would be protecting their interests independently, and with respect to his representation of Wheat, it would have involved one of his clients being a principal... not a principal witness, but certainly a witness with adverse information to the Petitioner at the trial and it was also particularly troubling about this case is the fact that he was representing defendants at widely disparate levels of what was a fairly large conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2970.785" offset="12016904">He testified, all right, the Government would recommend thirty days, go away, the Government so recommended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.355" offset="12039160">So, we have Government satisfaction with his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.890" offset="12053266">As to Gomez-Barajas being the source, that is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.360" offset="12071239">The facts of this case indicate there were several enumerated sources of marijuana, not Gomez-Barajas, and the reason he wasn't was there was a prior acquittal and Vidal was still shaking in his boots about the examination that he might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.918" offset="12121394">The question that Justice Stevens raised is absolutely true, that there was almost on the knees begging that this super-star defense lawyer be joined to the defense team.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.708" offset="12156607">Please, let me have Mr. Iredale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.726" offset="12164653">Let us add him to the trial team.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.343" offset="12171131">That's 1 RT 53-154.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.178" offset="12182416">However, also, there was two points for two of the witnesses, Vidal and one of the other witnesses, and the defense lawyer again says, please, please, let me have Mr. Iredale cross examine these witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.069" offset="12230063">That was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.869" offset="12233198">That was not available.</text>

            <text syncTime="3057.825" offset="12365064">When he said, could I be added to the defense team, what does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.544" offset="12383977">Was it clear that he would be in a subordinate position to someone else who would make the final call?</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.014" offset="12405815">If he was on the defense team and still had the decisions on those matters that were matters raising his conflict, it wouldn't do anything of any assistance to simply put him in with somebody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="3079.906" offset="12453358">I think the only one would be as to Bravo, and I think it could be easily sanitized as an alternative other than total disqualification to say that he cannot examine Bravo, and in the context of this case, I think that would have been reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.714" offset="12500587">The two other issues that I find every interesting is the Washington case, the former federal prosecutor, came out of the Ninth Circuit, and in that case, the trial judge did almost like here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.402" offset="12539353">This man is a former prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.187" offset="12546458">He may have had confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.973" offset="12553668">Appearance of evil, whap, he's off the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.925" offset="12565475">The Ninth Circuit reversed, remanded, and in that case, the former federal prosecutor, we had different clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.912" offset="12589404">The client, the former client is objecting, and the court held in that case, this appearance alone won't cut it because you have to honor the right to choice, and remanded it to determine if there was confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.118" offset="12634230">The same procedure that could have been done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.953" offset="12645515">Diozzio is, I think, a very close case, where the Government has negotiated with two tax lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.671" offset="12664427">They were willing to stipulate and at the time of trial, the Government says we're going to call the two tax lawyers as witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.760" offset="12692744">So, they knock them off of the case, and they offered a stipulation as to what they would be, witnesses in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.247" offset="12718762">They could not question the witness, but be an actual witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.680" offset="12728480">And the First Circuit reversed because of the tactical manipulation involved, and I think that there has to be some credence given to the right to choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.019" offset="12761812">The last thing I would say is that we have in our society at least the concept of an ordered liberty, a fundamental right of choice, the right to go with the one you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.792" offset="12796920">That kind of oozed out of Faretta and I think that rises up in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.379" offset="12815311">But what's very, very important is the fact that we can't review the imponderables.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.498" offset="12831715">What would Iredale have done in negotiations?</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.033" offset="12841851">They were close negotiations in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.719" offset="12848643">Could he have finalized that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.585" offset="12852091">What would Iredale have done on Vidal?</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.503" offset="12863794">How can I prove those things?</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.955" offset="12873616">It's impossible for me and should I suffer the detriment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.574" offset="12884065">I think that this case is analogous to Faretta, and I think that it has to be a showing that this Court will enforce in a limited context, in the context of these facts, which is a potential speculative conflict where all parties waived, that there must be a Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice.</text>
