            <text syncTime="9.250" offset="117920">This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.774" offset="143938">Here, the Clean Water Act provides that states may grant permits authorizing the discharge of set levels of certain pollutants under certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.040" offset="200990">After receiving a permit from the State of Virginia, petitioner repeatedly violated the conditions of the permit by exceeding effluent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.891" offset="260444">The respondents filed suit against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.951" offset="272670">The petitioner moved to dismiss the respondent's suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that the alleged violations occurred wholly in the past and that Section 505 of the Act which authorizes citizen suits does not grant jurisdiction over suits attacking such violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.045" offset="377055">The District Court held that Section 505 permits Federal Courts to exercise subject-matter jurisdiction over suits for wholly past violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.650" offset="427524">The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that those violations are encompassed by Section 505 and that they could pass on the District Court's alternative holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.013" offset="500980">In the opinion filed with the Clerk today, we conclude that Section 505 does confer jurisdiction over citizen suits where the citizen plaintiffs make a good faith allegation of continuous or intermittent violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.441" offset="574645">We, therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and remand the change for consideration of the good faith allegation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.872" offset="616337">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor have joined.</text>
