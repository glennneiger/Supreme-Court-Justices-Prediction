            <text syncTime="13.402" offset="190690">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.666" offset="199676">The City of San Jose has enacted a unique provision that it has added to an otherwise valid rent control ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.490" offset="243040">That provision raises the question whether or not a supplier of goods and services can be required to provide financial assistance to a consumer solely because of the consumer's ability to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.343" offset="302390">This case arises on appeal from the California supreme court that reversed a decision of the trial court and a decision of the district court of appeals that had held that this provision violated the "just compensation" clause, the "equal protection" clause, and the "due process" clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.946" offset="376787">The California supreme court rejected those arguments and found that the provision was valid under all three clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.521" offset="407089">The Opinion of the California supreme court found in effect that,</text>
            <text syncTime="73.940" offset="432793">"as long as a rent control ordinance provides a fair and reasonable return to the landlord, that the city has to power to use the excess funds for any other public purpose. "</text>
            <text syncTime="87.309" offset="486292">Our challenge in this case is based primarily on the "just compensation" clause in reliance on the Rule announced by this Court in both Agins and in the Nollan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.446" offset="538850">We do not challenge the one aspect of the Nollan rule; we do not challenge that we have been denied the economic viability of the use of our land.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.174" offset="581691">We do challenge its provision under the other part of the Nollan test, and that is that this provision fails to substantially advance a legitimate state interest under the reasoning of the Nollan Decision, that is to say, that there is no cause and effect, no nexus between any conduct by the landlord and the hardship of the tenant or the necessity to provide financial assistance to a tenant.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.882" offset="684614">Is there not some problem with the "just compensation" clause applying at all to this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="151.705" offset="743859">The way the ordinance works, if a landlord wants more than the rent that is otherwise provided by the mathematical formulas, he then establishes in his own mind what he believes is a reasonable rent, and he can then either petition the city to approve that additional rent as being reasonable, or in the alternative, the landlord can give a 30-day notice to the tenant, establishing this higher rent, and then the tenant has the opportunity to file a petition with the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.146" offset="861619">In either event, the hearing is held and the hearing officer looks at various factors... the factors he looks at are primarily the economic factors from the point of view of the landlord; his rent, his expenses, et cetera... how well he is maintaining the property, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.921" offset="924731">Based upon those factors, the hearing officer establishes what rent would be reasonable under the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.552" offset="6607200">It seems to me that Appellants predicate their opposition to the ordinance on a number of incorrect assumptions, that there is only one rational purpose for rent control, and that is to correct a non-competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.257" offset="6742096">It seems to me that there are a number of possible purposes for rent control, including for example, as an anti-inflationary measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.267" offset="6782116">Even where an ordinance, as ours is, is directed at a housing shortage, it can be directed towards correcting the social ills which result from the exploitation of the housing shortage, not just the market imbalance itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.806" offset="6864245">In our case the social ill that we are attempting to address is the dislocation of tenants in possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.789" offset="6900189">Not only does that kind of dislocation negatively impact the individual tenant, but it also affects the community as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.112" offset="6945433">If you develop a pattern of residential instability, it undermines the neighborhood sense of unity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.450" offset="6982840">Also today we increasingly find that homelessness which results from the escalating market rate of rents is an increasing problem for our city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.977" offset="7036966">The city has a variety of other programs which address the problem of finding affordable housing for low and medium income tenants who are looking for housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.002" offset="7089002">This particular regulation is addressed at protecting those who are already in possession of the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.640" offset="7119618">The tenant hardship provision directly and substantially furthers that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.464" offset="7150860">It prevents the landlords from taking unfair advantage of the housing shortage at the expense of those tenants who are on limited and fixed incomes.</text>
