            <label>Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg</label>
            <text syncTime="55.468" offset="356785">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="58.301" offset="368070">The issue in this case is the meaning of the Haskell Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.205" offset="383743">The Haskell Amendment is found in Section 6103(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.942" offset="410702">And it provides that the term, return information, does not include data which is in a form which cannot be associated with or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly a particular taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.653" offset="481546">The en banc majority of the Court of Appeals below read a reformulation requirement into the Haskell Amendment, but the term, reformulation, appears nowhere in the plain language of the Statute; appears nowhere in the legislative history of the Statute, indeed, does not even appear in the briefs of the Government below.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.436" offset="580602">By reading this reformulation requirement into the Haskell Amendment the Court of Appeals in effect held that data that is in Internal Revenue Service files which cannot be associated with, or identify a particular taxpayer must nonetheless be considered return information and generally nondisclosable in response to Freedom of Information Act requests or otherwise, unless it is also, in addition to nonidentification, reformulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.811" offset="726156">And the problem with this reformulation standard is that it is not articulated in a very precise way in the opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.083" offset="759280">There is very little guidance as to what is meant by reformulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.285" offset="772027">In fact, as the Court of Appeals en banc majority candidly acknowledge in their opinion, it was easier for them to say what they felt that the Haskell Amendment did not mean, than to articulate precisely what it did mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.628" offset="829392">And as an example of the imprecision, and the problems that are raised by this reformulation test, the Court of Appeals never specifies in what original form data must be in in tax files before it can be properly reformulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.673" offset="901595">As the dissent noted, there is information in Internal Revenue Service files in every kind of conceivable stage of development, and yet we don't know in what original form it must originate before it can be reformulated.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.757" offset="1209944">Let us say a Freedom of Information Act request came in and to properly respond to it, some data in the file of a third party taxpayer included some numbers on a piece of paper that were in the file, and that would be somehow comprehended hypothetically within the confines of the Freedom of Information Act request.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.353" offset="1300328">If those numbers divorced from identifying material, and I will now just give as an example, name, address, or social security number, but by no means the exhaustive list of what could be associated with a taxpayer, if that number were disclosable without any of what I have referred to generically as identifying material, it cannot be linked with a particular taxpayer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.567" offset="6893144">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.375" offset="6940373">I'd like to begin by giving my answer to a couple of questions that came up during the first argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.863" offset="6962316">It is important to keep returns and return information distinct in ones mind to the extent one can with these abstract phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.635" offset="6997425">Return is basically the Form 1040 and the attached Schedule A, Schedule B, Schedule C, Schedule D, the return itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.407" offset="7032533">And those are protected absolutely from disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.609" offset="7045386">The Haskell Amendment does not apply to them, and they cannot be disclosed even in redacted form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.846" offset="7070254">Return information is basically everything else as we see it in the taxpayer's audit file, except for the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.536" offset="7105049">There might be a report of the examining agent showing the results of his audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.071" offset="7123231">There might be a protest from the taxpayer protesting the proposed deficiency of the agent once set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.010" offset="7150920">There could be internal IRS correspondence about the nature of the taxpayer's claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.747" offset="7181849">There can be a Notice of Deficiency issued by the IRS to the taxpayer proposing an increase in his taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.734" offset="7201807">There could be a tax bill billing the taxpayer for a tax deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.870" offset="7218421">All these other things are return information because they are data that are either furnished to, collected by, prepared by the IRS in connection with the determination of that person's tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.695" offset="7277666">Now, the point is, a lot of the numbers on the return will find their way into the rest of the file because if you audit somebody's charitable contributions, you'll put down in your report what those contributions were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.920" offset="7322597">The point is, all the little numbers on the return will find their way into all the other documents that are called return information in the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.674" offset="7357601">And that gives a concrete example of what the Chief Justice asked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.644" offset="7373484">What we're saying is all those other documents are immune from disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.048" offset="7395113">They're saying, except for the return, you have to redact all those other documents: the revenue agent's report, the tax bill, notice of deficiency, and then disclose them in redacted form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.439" offset="7440671">Now, Justice White asked a question about would the IRS have to disclose in response to a request how many people earned income of $45,212?</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.580" offset="7497200">The answer is, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.199" offset="7503678">The IRS cannot be required, nor can any agency, to create a new document by doing research for the taxpayer, and saving okay, we think based on our records, there were 572 returns filed of that sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="2367.063" offset="9603191">The tax model is kind of a misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.615" offset="9617402">What it is is actually raw data.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.484" offset="9624821">It's a compilation of data that was drawn from a stratified sample of about 100,000 individual tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.323" offset="9656168">It was basically a pile of numbers on a computer tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.442" offset="9668706">For every return that was chosen for the sample, there were about 150 what they call fields or like entry boxes, where you would put the numbers for that sample.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.250" offset="9719906">About 30 of these entry boxes did not correspond at all to numbers or line items on a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.956" offset="9758777">Rather, they were computed amounts reflecting economic concepts like expanded income or capital gains tax at fifty percent rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.829" offset="9798169">This is all in the description of the tax model the IRS put out for 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.048" offset="9815097">Most of the other entry boxes on each sample did correspond roughly to line items on a return like salaries and wages, salaries and wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.673" offset="9857624">But there were a number of exceptions from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.875" offset="9870372">First of all, the numbers on the return would be corrected for mathematical errors and to eliminate any internal inconsistencies on the taxpayer's return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.564" offset="9909137">And then entered onto the tax model.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.849" offset="9918333">A number of the items on the taxpayer's return might be combined before transferring them to the tax model.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.554" offset="9957098">For example, if a taxpayer reported a bonus or a director's fee as miscellaneous income, that would be added back to wages and salaries and combined with it before it was put onto the tax model.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.131" offset="10015404">So it would be different treatment from the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.333" offset="10024285">And finally, some items would be treated differently on the tax model for economic reasons than they were shown on the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.356" offset="10056364">For example, an earned income credit which was shown on the return as a tax payment was shown on the model as a reduction in tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.110" offset="10091368">So basically, in 1976, the tax model was a compilation of data many of whose entries were lifted verbatim from tax returns with all identifiers removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.369" offset="10148419">But there also was some reformulation of the data by the IRS.</text>

            <text syncTime="2771.342" offset="11220275">And their position was all the individual audit files of particular named taxpayers we don't need to search, because the way we keep our records, there should be nothing in there but return information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.717" offset="11269804">And it would simply be impossible to go rummaging through all those files looking for some, one little study that somebody kind of found its way into a file by mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.107" offset="11311286">That study would appear somewhere else, and you'd look for it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.409" offset="11324556">But Judge Scalia clearly held in the panel opinion below that if the IRS can produce affidavits on remand that a whole group of individual audit files, for example, have nothing but return information in them, they don't even have to be searched.</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.794" offset="11426120">Now, there are a lot of very kind of technical textural arguments which we have made in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.165" offset="11471573">And I'm not going to go through those things... they're pretty complicated... one by one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.803" offset="11490068">They're drawn from various subsections of the statute we're construing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.355" offset="11504279">But the bottom line is as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.540" offset="11513056">Judge Scalia, writing for the majority below, concluded that petitioner's construction produces nine illogical or bizarre consequences at various points in the Statute, whereas his construction, which we embrace, produced only two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.752" offset="11581915">Judge Wald, in dissent, had a different count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.905" offset="11602499">She tallied up the score as only being 5 to 3 in the Government's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.940" offset="11618695">But all ten judges on the en banc Court agreed that as a matter of pure textural analysis, our position is superior to petitioner's, demonstrably superior to petitioner's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.415" offset="11664566">The defense response to that problem was to say that, well, normal principles of textural analysis should be kind of called off here, or given less importance because the Haskell Amendment was a last minute floor thing that kind of made a mess of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.592" offset="11729245">And we think that kind of agnostic approach just is unacceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.496" offset="11744919">The statutory law consists of the words that Congress enacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.114" offset="11763309">And you can't bypass the logical meaning of those words or the logical inferences from a text on the theory that Congress didn't know what it was doing, or was acting hastily or carelessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.688" offset="11805627">Another factor, I think, that cuts against the Petitioner's position is the way the Haskell Amendment was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.694" offset="11849722">As we've explained, the general definition of return information excludes literally billions of documents in individual taxpayer files all around the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.871" offset="11902385">Petitioner's theory is that all these documents become disclosable after being redacted by virtue of the Haskell Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.012" offset="12366946">The Census Act provided, much as our Statute provides, that Census data and information were to be kept confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.987" offset="12414803">And the Court held that the Census Act was an Exemption 3 Statute, and that all census data were protected from disclosure thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.627" offset="12457435">And the Court expressly rejected the argument,</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.396" offset="12468511">"that the confidentiality provisions protect raw data only if the individual respondent can be identified. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.419" offset="12504560">That's 455 U.S. at 355.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.121" offset="12519397">The Court clearly rejected any notion of redacting raw census data to remove the name or other identifiers of the census respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.945" offset="12566731">The Court held the data is absolutely protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.064" offset="12579165">And that shows, I think, how you treat redaction under an Exemption 3 Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.550" offset="12605079">If information is protected under FOIA Exemption 3, as census data was there, and is tax information is here, its simply not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.291" offset="12660040">It's exempt from FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.643" offset="12665474">You don't go and redact it in order to make it subject to FOIA by kicking it out of the Exemption 3 status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.813" offset="12698179">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Lee Hertzberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3149.502" offset="12732870">The Baldridge case is fairly illustrative of a different kind of statute and a dispositively different kind of result was reached in that case because the statute itself was a blanket prohibition against the release of census data.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.012" offset="12790966">The analogy, if there would be one, between the Baldridge census data statute and our case would be if the Census Data Act provided that raw census data which does not identify or cannot be associated with the person furnishing the data is not census data.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.640" offset="12865467">That would be the proper analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.524" offset="12872991">That's what makes our case different from Baldridge, and that's why you cannot ignore the Freedom of Information Act read in conjunction with the Haskell Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.614" offset="12909353">The Haskell Amendment says something that is not return information if it doesn't identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.851" offset="12934326">In the Census Statutes, this Court found without question, a blanket prohibition against disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.291" offset="12968076">That is a classic Freedom of Information Act (b)(3) withholding language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.528" offset="12993049">This category of materials under no circumstances will ever be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.282" offset="13016037">That's an easy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.165" offset="13019590">But when it says, this category of materials will not be disclosed unless it cannot be identified with or associated with a person, you have an absolutely different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.556" offset="13069118">And that's why we cannot ignore, as the Government would here, the Freedom of Information Act, because the two statutes must be read together as the three judge panel below said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.328" offset="13112168">And the way they are read together is that the blanket prohibition, the (b)(3) Freedom of Information Act withholding prohibition pertains to return information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.402" offset="13156471">But the Haskell Amendment tells us that return information does not include data which does not identify or cannot be associated with the taxpayer, and that is where the deletion and reasonable segregability provision of the Freedom of Information Act applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.764" offset="13225957">And it applies to everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.216" offset="13235779">It applies under Exemption 1 to National Security documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.585" offset="13245288">There can be a document, and if there is a portion which does not comprise--</text>
