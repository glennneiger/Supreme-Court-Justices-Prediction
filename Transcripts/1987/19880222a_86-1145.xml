            <label>Mr. Barbee B. Lyon</label>
            <text syncTime="64.156" offset="385339">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.977" offset="400699">The question before this Court today is whether the State of Oregon has authorized these defendants to monopolize a part of the practice of medicine in the relevant market and whether it has actively supervised their doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.702" offset="455557">This was an action for treble damages under the Sherman Act, Sections 1 and 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.706" offset="475619">Plaintiff is a physician, a surgeon in Astoria.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.141" offset="489307">The defendants also are physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.676" offset="499442">There was an economic rivalry between plaintiff and defendants that went back for ten years before the events in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.914" offset="524415">The defendants are associated with the clinic known as the Astoria Clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.983" offset="544686">They have associated with them three-fourths of the physicians in the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.769" offset="563808">There is one hospital in the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.423" offset="578437">Dr. Patrick is a surgeon, and if you are a surgeon, you must have access to a hospital in order to practice that branch of medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.910" offset="612396">Dr. Patrick lost his privileges at the hospital and he alleged that he was deprived of those privileges by defendants using their power, their dominant power over the hospital, on the staff of the hospital, and over the committees of the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.520" offset="670806">He alleged that they did so for an anticompetitive motive, and that it was anticompetitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.924" offset="700481">That they did not do so for medical, ethical or professional reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.160" offset="721379">The jury agreed with him after a three-week trial and awarded treble damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.314" offset="750009">The trial judge upheld the verdict and entered judgment accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.218" offset="773624">The Court of Appeals, however, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.289" offset="789924">The Ninth Circuit held that although there was sufficient evidence of the defendants' anticompetitive motive and sufficient evidence of their conduct, nevertheless what they did, unprofessional as it might have been, was immunized from antitrust laws by reason of the State action doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.285" offset="873934">Did the State action doctrine protect and defend what they did?</text>
            <text syncTime="192.189" offset="897548">The State action doctrine, as announced by this Court, has as its principles, its purpose, the resolution of principles of Federalism on the one side with State law on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.914" offset="952406">It draws a balance between the Federal antitrust laws and State policies which may be anticompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.353" offset="982185">As announced by this Court, there are two branches to the State action doctrine, two tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.257" offset="1005800">The first is whether or not the challenged restraint is one which is clearly articulated by the State and affirmatively expressed as a State policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.647" offset="1051357">The second branch of the test is whether or not it is actively supervised by the State itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.385" offset="1082286">Turning to the second of these first, was this conduct of defendants' actively supervised by the State of Oregon?</text>
            <text syncTime="246.741" offset="1115723">The defendants, the hospital, its staff and committees are all private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.478" offset="1138711">They are not agencies of the State of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.530" offset="1146861">They are not subject to the State Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.632" offset="1163266">There is no State statute providing any State agency which reviews what they do, authorizes any State agency to reverse what they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.772" offset="1203808">There is no State statute giving a right of appeal to any particular court under any form of procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.286" offset="1293878">There have been only two cases in which the State of Oregon Supreme Court considered whether or not it had such power.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.042" offset="1324912">In both cases, it expressly said that it did not decide whether it had the power or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.480" offset="1474646">Is that a form of State supervision in a sense, do you think, to provide that kind of an action?</text>

          <turn speaker="barbee_b_lyon" startTime="345.419" stopTime="555.173">
            <label>Mr. Barbee B. Lyon</label>
            <text syncTime="345.419" offset="1510486">Your Honor, this Court has never so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.069" offset="1521039">It would strike me as anomalous to say that because private conduct, because a State provides a forum in which litigants can sue each other and redress their private grievances, that doesn't amount to State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.047" offset="1580912">For example, the State provides a forum for people who have a dispute over a breach of contract or a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.284" offset="1609855">That does not mean the State is actively supervised in what they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.586" offset="1627096">The standard that this Court has announced is whether there is a pointed reexamination of what goes on in the challenged restraint to see that it does not unnecessarily interfere with the policies of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.031" offset="1692925">This Court has never held that judicial review of this type is that kind of pointed reexamination of the anticompetitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.838" offset="1744125">And least of all, I should suggest, should the Court announce that as a principle for the first time in a case where the State Supreme Court does not even know whether it has jurisdiction to consider these kinds of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.015" offset="1800863">When Dr. Patrick was confronted with what was being done to him in Astoria, there was really nothing he could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.406" offset="1846420">The one thing that occurred to him to do was to at least ask the hospital to appoint a neutral panel to consider the charges that were made against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.963" offset="1888634">He offered to submit to whatever decision the panel and the hospital would make if they would only appoint a neutral panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.284" offset="1921862">He said if they only would do that, that would avoid a lot of controversy and a lot of expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.955" offset="1944536">He renewed that request twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.890" offset="1952373">It was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.140" offset="1957284">There was no place else to turn to and this is how this case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.877" offset="1976301">The Court of Appeals purported to find active supervision in three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.269" offset="2021859">First of all, the results of a peer review decision in a State hospital are to be reported to the Board of Medical Examiners which is the State licensing authority for physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.909" offset="2068357">Yet, there is nothing in the Statute, and counsel concedes, I understand, that the State Board of Medical Examiners has no power to reverse or interfere with any decision made by the State Board of Medical Examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.002" offset="2124781">It can only make decisions about the medical license to practice medicine in the State of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.621" offset="2147246">Next, the Court of Appeals said there was adequate State supervision because the State Health Division licenses hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.631" offset="2195312">And there is a statute that requires the trustees or the governing body of a hospital to see to it that there are procedures in place for peer review.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.355" offset="2242228">The Court of Appeals said that because the Health Division had the authority to see that the governing body adopted procedures, that amounted to State supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.413" offset="2290397">There is no evidence in this case that the State Health Division has ever intervened in this case in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.733" offset="2315684">There's no evidence that it's ever intervened in any peer review proceeding in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.035" offset="2332925">There are no reported decisions of any case in which it has ever intervened.</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.871" offset="4344249">We challenge that particular holding for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.756" offset="4363788">First of all, we did not sue the State Board of Medical Examiners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.929" offset="4392523">We sued them previously for violations of the Civil Rights laws, and for violation of the Oregon Administrative Procedures Act, but that case was over.</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.614" offset="4515194">It was evidentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.280" offset="4521881">It displayed the entire course of conduct and was admissible for that purpose, and for no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.898" offset="4544347">We did not seek damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.314" offset="4549989">The damages that we sought were for injury to his business and property, which derived from the loss of his hospital privileges afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.770" offset="4587815">Dr. Russell furthermore had disqualified himself at the beginning of the proceedings and under Oregon law, he was therefore entirely without authority to act in any way thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.429" offset="4646433">Because of all of those reasons, the evidence of his conduct was admissible, should have been admitted, and the case should not have been reversed on that account.</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.247" offset="4745803">Oregon, like many States, in the mid-70s was faced with a malpractice crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.735" offset="4775687">The cost of insurance premiums for doctors was spiraling, the loss of doctors from practicing because of the lack of coverage was increasing, and indeed, the human tragedy visited by malpractice was evident to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.279" offset="4849875">The State of Oregon recognized that it had to address this malpractice crisis in a multifaceted way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.718" offset="4883625">It first armed the governing board of the hospitals of each private hospital with a substantial degree of direction and authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.693" offset="4927511">They were compelled not to simply accept a doctor because they had a license to practice in the State, but rather to make a more discriminating choice of whether they had the skill and training to receive credentialing in the specific areas in which they sought to practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.023" offset="5004833">They were compelled to establish standards for the review of doctors by doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.343" offset="5030120">And indeed they were compelled to put doctors together in a group of peer review for the purpose of reducing morbidity mortality and to improve patient care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.818" offset="5075991">They took another step during the 70s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.937" offset="5088530">The Board of Medical Examiners was armed with substantial authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.471" offset="5110681">One of the key portions of that authority was that its proceedings would be absolutely and totally confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.391" offset="5138371">The wisdom of that choice was demonstrated in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.712" offset="5159583">The number of complainants before the Board of Medical Examiners rose from 300 to 1500 per year once this confidentiality provision was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.003" offset="5208797">They granted immunity to complainants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.372" offset="5222277">They went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.407" offset="5230427">They compelled doctors to report on other doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.193" offset="5245578">They didn't say report in the event a doctor is not good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.697" offset="5267521">They stated report in the event that he is or may not be competent to practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.250" offset="5293748">They compelled hospitals to report in the same sort of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.654" offset="5311406">They established procedures for reexamination of doctors who were accused of practicing inappropriately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.908" offset="5340350">They compelled medical malpractice insurers to report every single claim against a doctor to the Board of Medical Examiners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.542" offset="5558943">So if the Federal antitrust law would forbid price fixing but the State says, we want price fixing, then the Federal Government would leave it alone.</text>
