            <text syncTime="18.462" offset="209363">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.763" offset="218558">The petitioners are here pursuant to Writ of Cert to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.817" offset="246770">And the issue is the authority of the FCC to preempt through the promulgation of certain minimal guidelines as to cable television signal quality, to preempt all local franchisers from promulgating technical standards as to signal quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.516" offset="337572">Now the Commission has adopted a deregulatory approach to technical standards explicitly as to signal quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.205" offset="376337">Now, in the past going back to 1972, the Commission itself had promulgated certain technical standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.442" offset="401311">It has recognized over the years, however, that these were incomplete and that they didn't cover certain problems such as ghosting of a picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.596" offset="433911">Nevertheless, in 1985, after the passage of the New Cable Act, the Commission determined to no longer continue these standards and after comments, issued a ruling in which these prior standards were continued as guidelines that could be included by franchisers in franchise agreements but that no other standard, whether a similar standard which was more stringent, or a standard for some other quality of signal quality could be promulgated by local franchisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.154" offset="588138">Now, the D.C. Circuit, finding more persuasive the argument of the Commission that it continue to have a broad delegated preemptive power which this Court had recognized in the Capital Cities case under the old Communications Act, that this continued under the New Cable Act, and held that as long as one technical guideline was adopted by the Commission as to a particular classification of channels, that they can preempt any standards by local franchisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.315" offset="744769">But even the Court of Appeals had some difficulty with the approach of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.833" offset="762845">The only classification of channels for which any standards, now guidelines, had ever been promulgated were the traditional broadcast channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.057" offset="807776">There had never been any standards or guidelines adopted for what is now the majority of cable televisions channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.846" offset="838914">The satellite but unencoded broadcasts, CNN, that sort of thing, the encoded broadcast, HBO, and then a fourth category that the FCC had promulgated, that is, the two-A interaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.875" offset="915087">For those other three types of channels, they had never promulgated any standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.029" offset="935671">And the Court of Appeals was troubled by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.480" offset="945493">And pointing to certain aspects which I'll get into a little later in the Cable Act that it would be very difficult, specifically the renewal process, be very difficult for franchisers to take part and make full use of renewal process without there being some standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.859" offset="1023025">And therefore remanded that aspect back to the Commission to reconsider.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="1755.035" offset="7155635">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.908" offset="7183221">Historically, the Commission applied technical standards requirements to so-called class one channels which are channels used to deliver broadcast signals of television stations because that was the clearest authority that the Commission had under the ancillary jurisdiction doctrine of the Southwestern Cable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.142" offset="7296070">The Commission began to regulate in this area before Congress enacted any statute dealing specifically with cable casting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.283" offset="7336716">Because the technical standards that the Commission adopted were principally focused on the signal both visual and oral that the worst located subscriber would actually receive on his set, and because the other classes of cable were coming through the same system, the standards for Class I channels tended also to control the quality of signals for the other classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.841" offset="7498884">And for that reason, the Commission never did adopt standards specifically with respect to the other classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.501" offset="7553533">But it is now considering that question on remand in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.572" offset="7573804">We did not raise any question about the correctness of that remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.392" offset="7597105">The question that the petitioners have presented with respect to the Commission's authority to prescribe maximum standards for Class I channels will necessarily have a spillover effect to what the Commission can do about the other classes of channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.972" offset="7679443">So they're is a relationship there regardless of whether technically the other classes are before the Court on this petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.082" offset="7747884">Do you understand them to be before us?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="1905.433" offset="7757288">--I had not understood them to be before the Court except in the spillover effect that would necessarily occur from the decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.789" offset="7790724">The FCC Regulation that is at issue explicitly prohibits local franchising authorities from enforcing more stringent technical standards for cable casters than the standards that the FCC has prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.537" offset="7873689">After the standards are set out on the preceding pages, then on page 87 of the Appendix to the Petition, the Commission Regulation is quite explicit that these rule sections or less stringent versions of them may be used as standards by state or local regulatory authorities, no technical parameter in excess of the above rule sections may be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.091" offset="7999913">And the way local authorities require standards is through the franchising process or the renewal process in the franchise agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.066" offset="8047769">So there's no doubt that the Commission's intent, as its report and order explain unmistakably as well, was to prevent the local authorities from enforcing more stringent standards on the cable casters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.710" offset="8126346">And this case therefore presents no occasion to consider guides to interpretation that the Court has adverted to in other cases that would disfavor preemption when there's some ambiguity about whether preemption was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.672" offset="8206280">The question in the case is whether this regulation exceeds the scope of the Commission's statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.528" offset="8241702">We do not claim that the statute itself accomplished this preemption of more stringent standards or that the statute required the Commission to preempt local authority in this way--</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.422" offset="8309203">And in this respect, the case is similar to the Capital Cities against Crisp case in which the preemption flowed entirely from the Commission's regulation adopted in the exercise of its broad authority to further the national communications policy and not from anything in the statute, which at that time didn't even refer to cable casting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.124" offset="8515988">So that the discretion is in the Commission whether to establish the technical standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.742" offset="8534483">And what has been remanded by the D.C. Circuit in this case is the question of whether the Commission could preclude local authorities from establishing their own technical standards with respect to Classes II, III and IV, if the Commission has not established any technical standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.822" offset="8618806">And of course that could be resolved by just having the Commission establish some technical standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.863" offset="12371035">As the Commission has indicated, the issue in this case is different from the issue in the usual preemption case that comes before the Court, because here there is an express statement by the Commission that it intends to preempt local regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.925" offset="12447208">The basic question then is the question that the Court has been discussing which is, what is the scope of the Commission's authority under the Cable Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.180" offset="12484302">Is it broad enough in fact to allow the Commission to issue the regulations that it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.167" offset="12508230">We think that the authority is broad enough, for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.505" offset="12529546">First of all, the Commission was specifically given authority in Section 624(e) to establish technical standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.713" offset="12570401">And there are no limitations in that grant of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.431" offset="12589314">We think that language is broad enough not just to give the Commission the power to pick some numbers, which seems to be the interpretation that the Cities argue for, but a power also to consider the policies that go together within picking the numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.244" offset="12664546">Now, the Commission, I think everybody concedes could have established more detailed or more stringent standards than the ones it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.017" offset="12703626">But what it decided as a matter of Federal policy is that the best way to serve the goals to encourage better technology and to keep the cost of cable services reasonable was not to have any additional regulation, but in fact to let the industry itself develop the standards that would achieve those goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.800" offset="12794741">Now, obviously, to suit that policy, there must be preemption of additional local standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.155" offset="12828177">Otherwise, in fact, the policy couldn't be carried out.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3176.107" offset="12839985">That made a lot of sense to me until I realized these standards you're talking about are performance standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.575" offset="12861823">What you've just described makes it sound as though you're describing technological standards so that the municipalities won't force technology into one direction or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.735" offset="12914486">But you're telling me that what the Commission has come up with anyway is performance standards, hasn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="3199.121" offset="12932040">Well, they are performance standards that involve obviously a technical component.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.925" offset="12951266">And the question for the industry of course is what kinds of facilities and equipment will meet those particular performance standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.613" offset="12985957">I think that is what the Commission has aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.148" offset="12996093">If you look at the history of technical regulation, there is a ten-year period of course where the Commission has followed exactly the same policy before the Cable Act as it now is pushing in the same, in the regulations since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.908" offset="13059204">Before that, however, from 1972 to 1974, the Commission followed exactly the policies the cities would like it to have to follow now.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.433" offset="13109255">No, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.002" offset="13111554">It's from '72 to '74, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.618" offset="13122003">And then in '74, they changed the regulations and followed them that way for a decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.171" offset="13144259">But from '72 to '74, they had just this policy that the cities are arguing for where they imposed minimum standards and allowed the cities to go above those standards and impose whatever technical standards they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.081" offset="13199848">And in '74, the Commission came back to the issue and said, this has been a disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.002" offset="13223567">What is happening is that we are having inconsistent regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.104" offset="13239972">The cities are competing with each other to outdo each other in these requirements and the opposite of what we hoped would happen is happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.310" offset="13272782">The cost is going up, and technology is being stifled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.280" offset="13288664">So it changed its regulations and for ten years prior to the Cable Act, followed a policy of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.450" offset="13317294">Now, the particular argument that the cities make, therefore, if you look at it carefully, would mean that what Congress did in 1984 is it said to the Commission, you cannot follow the policy that you've been following for ten years... ten years where the technology of cable expanded enormously, and you must go back to a policy that you tried for two years, and gave up on as a failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.085" offset="13427844">And what we are saying is that if you look at the structure of the Act, and particularly Section 624, which deals with these matters, there simply is not any indication that Congress intended to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.594" offset="13477895">The language of the Act to the uninitiated is a little confusing, though, because in 624(b), it says the franchising authority may establish requirements for facilities and equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.585" offset="13529931">That's correct, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.354" offset="13536932">Of course, 624 does not make any specific reference to technical standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.656" offset="13558143">And I think what essentially 624 and 624(b) and (e) do put together is to essentially have the same structure that the FCC regulations have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.881" offset="13607044">The FCC didn't try to regulate many aspects of facilities and equipment, like safety codes and things like that, whether they met fire codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.552" offset="13637764">They did regulate this one area of technical standards, and I think the language fairly tracks that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.623" offset="13662006">Now, I would just like to touch briefly on the point about renewal that has been made several times here, because I think the cities have said, referring not to 624, but to Section 626, that they really can't have a renewal process unless they have their own standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.852" offset="13734940">And I don't think that that's so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.537" offset="13741732">First of all, there are the FCC standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.006" offset="13755524">So if you are looking for a set of objective standards, the FCC standards are ones that cities can use in their franchises.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="3413.594" offset="13789902">Well, I guess their argument though is those are so minimal that they want to do better, that they don't do well enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.931" offset="13815293">Well, Justice O'Connor, I think that that points up one of the differences here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.002" offset="13835564">I think that there is a difference between the power of the Commission essentially to establish regulations and to make them preemptive which I think is what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.041" offset="13879658">I think there is a separate issue which is whether these standards are adequate standards for the purposes that the cities would like to use them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.380" offset="13913095">They are of course free to do several different things if they don't like the particular standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.717" offset="13934411">They can go to the Commission, for example, and say, we have particular local conditions which are causing us a problem that makes your standards inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.091" offset="13979864">And we would like a waiver from the Commission in order to allow us to use some additional standards or more detailed standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.262" offset="14008599">And the Commission has the power to grant that waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.531" offset="14017689">They even have a procedure for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.781" offset="14022705">Or it can go to the Commission and say, change the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.768" offset="14038587">We think the Federal standards should be higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.320" offset="14052798">They should be more detailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.422" offset="14061262">What the cities can't do though I think is what they are asking to do here, which is to say regardless of what your standards are, however high they are, we can always impose our own idiosyncratic standards on top of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.531" offset="14125627">And it is that, I think, what the Commission was concerned about.</text>

            <text syncTime="3518.095" offset="14207965">But I think the question there would not be the basic question of whether they have the power to preempt but whether the decision to do so was arbitrary or capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.534" offset="14245686">And I think in the case of the channels II, III and IV below, that is what the Court of Appeals in essence said.</text>

            <text syncTime="3595.278" offset="14516628">Thank you, Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.678" offset="14522271">As to Justice Stevens' inquiry as to the source of the power under the Act, I'd refer you to footnote 7 in which we set out the wording under the New Cable Act, and it amends the Communications Act Section 2(a) to provide that the provisions of this Act, the Communications Act, shall apply with respect to cable service to all persons engaged within the United States as provided in Title IV, the Cable Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.233" offset="14644524">And at footnote 16, we've indicated there was a prior Senate version of that kind of amendment which might more reasonably support their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.605" offset="14686006">That version was rejected and this version was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.624" offset="14698022">And I want to point out that there is a claim that the Federal policy is to protect the national market, that there be standardization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.717" offset="14754447">We submit, Your Honor, that that's a matter that was decided by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.336" offset="14772837">If one looks at 624, it's clear that the standards are those that are to be responsive to the community needs, it's the local franchiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.143" offset="14812125">Even if we don't have the power to issue technical standards, our broad power to require equipment and facilities would necessarily reject the argument that the effect on national suppliers is a consideration under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.836" offset="14878894">Congress decided those kind of problems would be dealt through the modification process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.057" offset="14899792">If they're not commercially practicable, then they fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.192" offset="14912331">Finally, I'd like to point out that this claimed continuance of the prior dual regulation, it's always been the FCC's position, at least under the Communications Act, that it would regulate the operational aspects and leave to the localities some small area of protection, protection of the equipment from the elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.743" offset="15014522">And that approach is confirmed by a reading of Capital Cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.230" offset="15036465">The purport to have a broad power in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.199" offset="15048377">They are now trying to continue that under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.051" offset="15059766">At most, they've been given some power as to technical standards but it certainly in any event is not a continuation of what was being done prior the the Act.</text>
