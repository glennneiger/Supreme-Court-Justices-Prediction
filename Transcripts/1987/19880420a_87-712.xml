            <text syncTime="13.992" offset="191177">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.793" offset="218344">This case presents jurisdictional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.577" offset="233495">The Grant Appeals Board of the Department of Health and Human Services disallowed $11.3 million in federal financial participation under the Medicaid program to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.497" offset="285218">The Commonwealth challenged that disallowance in the United States District Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts claiming that that court has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.031" offset="319386">Our position is that the United States Claims Court has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.245" offset="340179">The Court of Appeals agreed with each side in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.288" offset="356375">We petitioned this Court to review the Court's partial assertion of jurisdiction, and the Commonwealth cross-petitioned to review the Court's partial refusal to exercise jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.045" offset="403396">The petition and cross-petition were both granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.937" offset="414994">By way of background, this case arises from two audits covering the years 1978 to 1982 of Massachusetts expenditures at intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.539" offset="469329">Applying a longstanding HHS regulation, the auditors determined that Massachusetts had improperly claimed Medicaid reimbursement for certain educational services that the State Department of Education was required to pay for.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.138" offset="535784">$11.3 million in federal financial participation was disallowed, and that is a small fraction of the total federal financial participation for Massachusetts at these facilities in the years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.726" offset="590119">As was its right, Massachusetts challenged that disallowance in the Grant Appeals Board, an entity created by regulation in 1973 to review disallowances on behalf of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.355" offset="640692">The Grant Appeals Board upheld the disallowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.847" offset="654589">The money has since been recouped by reducing certain Medicaid grants to Massachusetts in subsequent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.034" offset="691370">In response to the GAB decisions, Massachusetts filed complaints for judicial review in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.020" offset="727314">The Commonwealth recognized that there is no statute providing specifically for judicial review of disallowance decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.866" offset="762736">The complaints did assert that 5 U.S. C 702, part of the Administrative Procedure Act, waives the sovereign immunity of the United States, and permits this kind of action to proceed in District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.853" offset="818638">The District Court said that it had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.874" offset="826684">The District Court disagreed with the Grant Appeals Board decisions in their entirety, and said that the Commonwealth was entitled to federal financial participation for all of these services, and entered a judgment reversing the Grant Appeals Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.656" offset="889796">We appealed, and argued among other things that the District Court had entered a money judgment against the United States without any applicable waiver of sovereign immunity that permitted such a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.653" offset="937861">The problem with using 5 U.S.C. 702 as the applicable waiver of sovereign immunity is that that statute applies only to actions</text>
            <text syncTime="212.343" offset="984568">"seeking relief other than money damages. "</text>
            <text syncTime="215.386" offset="996793">We contend that the $11.3 million at issue here is money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.061" offset="1019468">Now it is important to understand that we were not arguing that the Grant Appeals Board decisions were unreviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.225" offset="1044127">Rather our position was that the Tucker Act which does waive sovereign immunity for money judgments permitted an action in the United States Claims Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.799" offset="1254465">That is the crux of the issue presented by the Commonwealth's cross-petition, and we think that it is really the crux of the issue presented by our petition, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.032" offset="1283304">That question is addressed rather squarely in the legislative history of the 1976 amendments to the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.439" offset="1321025">When Congress used the phrase money damages, it meant monetary relief as opposed to declaratory injunctive mandamus relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.146" offset="1359791">Why do you suppose that Congress did not use language like is used in the Tucker Act if they intended it to mean the same thing?</text>

            <text syncTime="315.453" offset="1396989">Well, there actually is no language in the Tucker Act that refers to money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.244" offset="1416215">The Tucker Act is a very old statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.836" offset="1426560">And the limitations on the powers of the Claims Court under the Tucker Act have been inferred from the surrounding context, and not directly from the language of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.033" offset="1471386">It is a very broadly written statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.555" offset="1477446">In any event, I think that Congress took a proposal that was given to it by the Administrative Conference, a proposal that is backed up by numerous memoranda that often refer to all forms of monetary relief being excluded from the proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.958" offset="1551007">The Administrative Conference happened to use the words money damages, words that are not unnatural to use to describe all forms of monetary relief, and those are the words that Congress enacted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.127" offset="6891690">The importance of Circuit Court review that was discussed earlier in the argument is not as Mr. Englert suggests just a question of a policy preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.875" offset="6938710">In fact, as one of the Justices has pointed out and one of the amicus briefs has addressed, there is a certain familiarity that Circuit Courts develop with a given state's Medicaid plan and disputes that might arise either between states or between the Secretary and the state in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.718" offset="7018122">But the more important point that I wish to address on that score is that Congress has provided evidence that it believes that the Circuit Court's role is important in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.697" offset="7070054">And that is, and it cannot be disputed here, is that when Congress addressed the question of judicial review of disputes between the Secretary and the states under the Medicaid program, that it expressly authorized states to bring petitions to the Circuits Courts to review instances in which the Secretary has found that states, or their plans, or their amendments to their state plans are not in compliance with the Medicaid Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.615" offset="7373701">There is no significant difference between the action of the Secretary involved here and the kind of action that arises when the Secretary finds that the state or an amendment to a plan does not comply with the Medicaid Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.467" offset="7557081">Because here, as the Secretary points out, there is a lack of a specific statute providing for review of disallowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.070" offset="7587487">We turn to the statutory context to determine under what statute that a state can bring an action, and under what statute that Congress has waived sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.629" offset="7629701">And that judgment is formed partially by the statute that governs the waiver in this Section 702, but it is also governed by the overall statutory context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.655" offset="7673796">Because if the Secretary is correct, it means that Congress somehow chose to divert cases such as ours, the disallowance cases, from the local courts, the District Courts and the Circuit Courts, and send them to a more specialized centralized forum like the Claims Court and like the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.679" offset="7757910">And we think that is a reading of the statutory context that cannot be supported.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.828" offset="7934498">Because as I said, it was the result of earlier litigation with the Secretary over the question of whether a given dispute between the states and the Secretary was a compliance matter or a disallowance matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.537" offset="7989355">In those cases that were litigated all over the country, Circuit Courts roughly determined that certain questions that arose under the program were indeed compliance matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.917" offset="8042854">But in those cases, the Secretary represented to the various Circuit Courts of Appeal around the country that he would not contest District Court jurisdiction over the same cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.071" offset="8083500">So it was not surprising that in this case that not only did we identify 702 as the source of the waiver, but that we proceeded in the District Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.512" offset="8393313">Now in that event, we would have had an appeal to the Circuit Court on the same record testing the question of whether the Secretary had erroneously read the Medicaid Act to exclude those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.942" offset="8442945">And furthermore, Your Honor, those cases could also implicate money as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.965" offset="8467082">Because under the Secretary's regulations, if you are successful through the administrative process and we presume through the judicial process in successfully overturning the denial of an amendment, you are entitled to a lump sum covering the services back to the time that the amendment was submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.738" offset="8554227">So with all respect, Your Honor, it does not merely address situations where the state wishes to identify a legal issue at the threshold and litigate that question before any injury occurs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2156.523" offset="8761326">By way of background, one of the reasons why these disallowance cases are growing is that the Secretary chooses to implement policy judgments through the disallowance mechanism rather than to specifically state through regulations what services are covered and which are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.947" offset="8850978">And so when the Court considered the case a few terms ago of Connecticut, a similar Connecticut state agency against the Secretary, Connecticut cited the same sort of broad disallowance that carried a prospective effect and implications for further services given by that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.846" offset="8966648">So it may be well for Mr. Englert to say that in the abstract that certain cases can still proceed when states challenge regulations under a particular grant-in-aid program, but it is very much part of this record that the disallowance procedure is used for far different purposes than a technical audit or the adjustment of an accounting error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.386" offset="9088797">It is used, as both of the lower courts found, to make prospective coercive judgments about the scope of the Medicaid Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.192" offset="9131951">The states are forced at that point to decide that once they receive that first disallowance and while they are still in the administrative process before the Grant Appeals Board, the states are forced to make a judgment about whether they should continue to provide those services knowing that they have an exposure, that the millions of dollars that they spent could well be disallowed at some indeterminate time in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.418" offset="9228917">And faced with that kind of situation and that kind of relationship, it is important that we be able to go to the District Courts to secure declaratory and injunctive relief that would bind the parties in our future relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.190" offset="9292029">The Court of Appeals, if I might just read one excerpt from the decision, said that the Commonwealth's requested injunction is not specific to the retrospective 1978-1982 reimbursement disallowed by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.379" offset="9348767">Rather, it stretches into the future as does the legal relationship between the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.019" offset="13875265">There are limitations on what actions can brought under the Tucker Act, but they depend on the form of the relief sought and whether there exists a money mandating statute, not on general subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.686" offset="13913926">The Tucker Act like the APA cuts across all subject matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.257" offset="13932212">Finally, I do not think that it is relevant to any issue before this Court whether the states have to come to Washington to litigate or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.053" offset="13967425">But for what it is worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.025" offset="13975366">28 U.S.C. 44 allows the Federal Circuit to sit anywhere that any Court of Appeals can sit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.279" offset="13996369">28 U.S.C. 173 allows the Claims Court to sit anywhere in the nation.</text>
