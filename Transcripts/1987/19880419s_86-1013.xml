            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="81045">In the Lyng case No. 86-1013, the case comes to us on certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.039" offset="129110">It involves a dispute about the scope of the First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.555" offset="155233">The Court of Appeals approved a permanent injunction forbidding the Federal Government from constructing a road through the Chimney Rock area of the Six Rivers National Forest in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.511" offset="203089">This area of the National Forest has traditionally been used for religious rituals by members of three American-Indian tribes that live nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.390" offset="242586">Those religious practices which require privacy, silence, and an undisturbed natural setting can only be carried out at specific sites in the Chimney Rock area.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.605" offset="291383">The Court below found that the proposed road would so disturb the natural environment that it would virtually destroy the Indians' ability to practice their religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.320" offset="334224">The Court also found that the government had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in completing the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.157" offset="361600">Using a balancing test to weight the Indians' interest and that of the United States, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Indians' right to their free exercise of their religion would be unconstitutionally infringed by the government's proposed activities in the Chimney Rock area.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.371" offset="430459">In an opinion filed today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.394" offset="450521">Two terms ago in the case of Bowen against Roy, we held that the Free Exercise Clause cannot be understood to require the government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with the religious belief of particular citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.802" offset="520216">In that case as in this one, the government's management of its internal affairs threaten to interfere significantly with the ability of private people to pursue spiritual fulfillment according to their own religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.327" offset="582283">In neither case, however, did the government's proposed action threatened either to coerce religious adherence and the acting contrary to their belief or to penalize religious adherence for exercising their religious freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.607" offset="643409">Our decision in Bowen against Roy, therefore, compels us to conclude that the free exercise challenge to the government's construction project must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.480" offset="686877">We note, however, that the government's right to manage the public lands need not and should not discourage it from accommodating religious practices like those at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.816" offset="736301">The American-Indian Religious Freedom Act establishes a national policy in favor of protecting and preserving the right of Indians to visit their traditional religious sites and to carry out their traditional rituals.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.685" offset="795755">Although this statute does not create enforceable legal rights, it does encourage the government to minimize the extent to which its management of the public lands interferes with Indian religious practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.117" offset="849463">In this case the government has planned various ways for minimizing the effects that its road will have on the Chimney Rock area and nothing in our decision should discourage such ameliorative measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.370" offset="902439">The case is remanded for deciding certain statutory issues, which we have not addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.612" offset="927412">Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Marshall and Blackmun have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.398" offset="950609">Justice Kennedy took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
