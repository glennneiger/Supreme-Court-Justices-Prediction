            <text syncTime="57.670" offset="368407">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.455" offset="379587">The issue in this case is whether the state's use of a preclusion sanction as to relevant probative testimony of a defense witness in order to enforce its discovery rules violated the compulsory process clause of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.398" offset="439356">On the second day of a four day jury trial, defense counsel sought to amend his list of witnesses to include the witness Alfred Wormley.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.487" offset="471643">The trial judge reserved his ruling on this request until the following morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.308" offset="494944">At that time, the court ordered that the witness testify under oath as an offer of proof outside of the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.212" offset="526605">The witness' testimony was subjected to cross-examination by both the prosecutor and the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.799" offset="548965">After hearing this testimony and arguments, the court found that there had been a blatant and willful violation of the discovery rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.804" offset="580939">The court ordered that the witness be precluded from testifying stating,</text>
            <text syncTime="115.208" offset="598598">"I feel that defense attorneys have been violating discovery in this courtroom in the last three or four cases blatantly, and I am going to put a stop to it, and this is one way to do so. "</text>
            <text syncTime="125.481" offset="639662">He further remarked that he was considering reporting the defense attorney to the disciplinary commission, and that he did not think that any attorney should violate any orders purposefully to get an edge for his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.539" offset="683862">It is our position that the court's exclusion of the witness was arbitrary and that it violated the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.359" offset="711134">Although there is a serious question as to whether the preclusion sanction would ever be constitutionally permissible, all parties are in agreement at the very least that before the sanction may be employed that a balancing test must be used to determine whether the state's interest in using preclusion outweighs the defendant's right to present his defense witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.741" offset="800681">The balancing test that we urge this Court to adopt is the one that has been employed by the vast majority of lower courts addressing this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.295" offset="830879">That test begins with a presumption against exclusion of otherwise admissible defense evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.501" offset="859718">The presumption is required because the integrity of the judicial system depends on a full and fair disclosure of the defendant's version of the facts as well as the state's, so that the jury may be decide where the truth lies.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="193.458" offset="911545">Well, the integrity of the system depends to a certain extent to one complying with rules of court requiring you to give lists of witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.231" offset="950624">And we have to look at the intent of the discovery rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.433" offset="963476">The main intent of the discovery rules is to prevent surprise for the other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.020" offset="985837">And when the rule has not been complied with, we feel that the proper steps that a court should take is to see that the other party be made whole in terms of surprise.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="228.881" offset="1053233">Certainly, the prosecution never wants a continuance in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.416" offset="1067444">A continuance usually is almost entirely for the benefit of the defendant.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard E. Cunningham</label>
            <text syncTime="237.904" offset="1089387">Well, I would point out in that regard that in Illinois that there is a long line of cases that were the state has violated the discovery rules and seeks to now put what would be termed a surprise witness before the court that if the defendant simply objects and asks for a preclusion and the court then admits the testimony, on appeal the defendant has waived his right to appeal if he has not requested a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.305" offset="1198996">Because the courts in Illinois hold that that is conclusive evidence that the defendant was not prejudiced by the admission of the testimony, since the defendant did not even indicate that he needed a continuance to prepare for that witness' testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.314" offset="1255003">I am not saying that a continuance in every case would be the proper remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.301" offset="1274960">Certainly, in the instant case, I do not think that the state even needed a continuance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.039" offset="1297948">Once it heard what the witness' testimony was going to be, it then had before it and knew what witnesses it needed in order to reflect that testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.839" offset="1405050">Again it would depend on each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.058" offset="1413932">I certainly believe, again to get back to the facts of this case, that no continuance was required at all in order to make the state whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.712" offset="1440577">The Illinois discovery rules, I might point out, provide that a continuance is one of the remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.782" offset="1468894">But another remedy is that the other party be put on notice as to what the material is that needs to be discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.488" offset="1503689">In this case, we had the perfect remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.174" offset="1510480">We had the state hearing under oath what the testimony of that witness was going to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.174" offset="2846487">The denial of the defendant's right calls into question the ultimate integrity of the fact finding process, and requires that the competing interest be closely examined.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.412" offset="5299385">The state's witnesses were Jack Bridges and his three relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.781" offset="5316835">They stated that Ray Taylor had shot him during a fight that Mr. Bridges and his relatives were having with Ray Taylor and his friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.470" offset="5347659">The defense presented two witnesses, two eyewitnesses to the event, who testified that Ray Taylor was not armed during the event, that it was Jack Bridges' brother who fired shots into the crowd trying to protect Jack Bridges and who shot Jack Bridges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.663" offset="5408368">Mr. Wormley, also I might add that Bridges and Bethany, his brother, had both testified that they were unarmed on that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.168" offset="5438461">Mr. Wormley, the excluded witness, would have testified that prior to the incident sometime earlier in the evening that he joined a group of people including Jack Bridges and his family on the porch of Bridges' sister.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.660" offset="5488407">He had observed Bridges handing a blanket containing two pistols to his girlfriend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.797" offset="5512962">And he had further overhead Bridges and his family discussing how they were going to go after Ray Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.284" offset="5534905">Now this testimony was very crucial to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.320" offset="5547026">Number one, it corroborated the other two witnesses, and it was an independent source of corroboration in that it occurred at a different time and at a different location.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.676" offset="5584433">Number two, it directly rebutted the testimony of Bridges and Bethany that they were unarmed on that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.579" offset="5608048">And number three, it added an element to the defense's case which was totally lacking, and that is the element of planned aggression on the part of Bridges and his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.535" offset="5647858">So this testimony was crucial to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.937" offset="5657471">Now once the state had heard all of that testimony and the offer or proof, they were no longer surprise, and surprise is the main thing that we are looking to overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.461" offset="5703551">At that point, they were no longer surprised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.813" offset="5712956">Also I might add, at that point in the trial, there were still three of the state witnesses to be presented, and all of the defense to be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.067" offset="5742004">The trial did not end until the following day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.320" offset="5763006">So at that point, the state basically knew the witnesses that it needed to rebut Mr. Wormley's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.743" offset="5792681">They needed the complaining witness and his family who were all present there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.862" offset="5805220">Now if from talking to them they felt that they needed additional witnesses, then they could inform the court as to what they needed and how much time they needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.201" offset="5838552">And then perhaps the court could make a determination as to whether that would be so prejudicial to the state to have to grant a continuance at that time that he would consider precluding the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.724" offset="5876691">But absent any showing at all that the state was going to be prejudiced, we feel that this Court must find that there was a violation of the Sixth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1672.756" offset="6828802">The position of the State of Illinois in this proceeding is that when a defendant as Petitioner Taylor did in this case sought to compel witnesses to attend court, he did so understandably in an effort to present evidence to a jury which was going to decide his guilt or his innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.941" offset="6953458">In the course of doing that or in the attempt to do so, it is incumbent upon defendants as well as prosecutors in this country to do so with compliance with established procedures, procedures which we submit assure fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.092" offset="7050111">It is not merely the element of surprise that discovery rules address.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.560" offset="7271943">And at that time, the defense attorney stated that he had just learned of an additional witness who could have and probably did see the entire incident.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.554" offset="7543930">Because we are talking about an effort to assure fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2872.696" offset="11628541">What the judge did, however, in that instance was I believe a very measured and appropriate response from which I derive inference that he was conducting a balancing approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.402" offset="12903316">In Illinois, we virtually give our file in its entirety to the defendant before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.056" offset="12929961">Certainly, given that, it is not appropriate under due process or the Sixth Amendment for the defendant to be able to obtain an advantage, if he can get everything and go to trial and present as a surprise untested evidence even though he has violated those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.172" offset="13018464">Defendant's violation of those rules were very flagrant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.325" offset="13043019">I believe that judge acted in a judicious, tempered, and balanced manner, a manner which did not affect the outcome of this trial, nor could it be said that the absence of Wormley's testimony, although perhaps there is a conceivable benefit that could have been derived from it, would nevertheless never have affected the integrity of the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.839" offset="13137060">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.561" offset="13167989">Justice Scalia, in answer to your question which I was never able to get to, it is true that all parties including the Solicitor General agree that a balancing test must be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.200" offset="13198500">In this case, it clearly was never applied by the trial judge unlike what was going on in Illinois since People v. Rayford in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.270" offset="13226817">We ask that this Court apply the balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.222" offset="13238624">And if it does so, I think that the defense will win the case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3279.460" offset="13255551">If it has been going on Illinois since 1976, why did not anybody ask the trial judge and this Court do it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.364" offset="13279166">Well, Your Honor, we have raised in effect with assistance of counsel, we raised it before this Court, and this Court chose to only accept the case on question one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.684" offset="13312498">So unlike the state said, we certainly argued in effect with assistance of counsel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.605" offset="13332142">But again the burden should be on the Court to apply that balancing test in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.979" offset="13373625">Or can the trial judge just think it through and weigh the pros and the cons and the prejudice?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard E. Cunningham</label>
            <text syncTime="3319.668" offset="13416466">Except the evidence of prejudice would have to appear of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.453" offset="13427542">And here we have no evidence that the state would have been prejudiced had Mr. Wormley been allowed to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.589" offset="13448126">Here we have no evidence that less severe sanctions would not have been appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.476" offset="13463695">And in answer to another one of your questions about the materiality of the witness, yes, that is part of the balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.129" offset="13486265">And here I believe that we have demonstrated that this witness was highly material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.098" offset="13502147">I might add that the jury went out to deliberate and came back and sent a message requesting the testimony of the complaining witness and his brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.604" offset="13532136">It was not until after they had reviewed that testimony until they returned a verdict of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.556" offset="13551989">This is a very close credibility case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.608" offset="13564214">As to the fact that the record is clear that Mr. Taylor was not responsible here for his attorneys at best negligence, there is no question about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.523" offset="13655852">The lawyer said that the defendant had told him long before trial of the existence of Mr. Wormley, and we know that the lawyer interviewed Mr. Wormley at his home a week before trial and served him with a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.181" offset="13702454">I do not think that on those facts that it is at all fair to an uneducated criminal defendant twenty years old to put onto him that he was somehow aware of what these discovery rules were about.</text>
