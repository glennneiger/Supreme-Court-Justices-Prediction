            <label>Mr. Stephen B. Bright</label>
            <text syncTime="935.567" offset="3894413">Well, two points on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.804" offset="3911340">First of all, whatever... and I think the District Court considered this because he asked them something about the nature of that challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.875" offset="3939657">Whatever it was they decided was not the claim that is presented here, because they didn't know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.611" offset="3962644">They did not make a knowing tactical decision based on all the available information, because the information was hidden from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.932" offset="3987931">In fact, the whole nature of this plan was to deceive them into thinking that there was sufficient representation of women and blacks, that this really wasn't worth wasting the time on to try to raise a challenge like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.359" offset="4037564">But secondly, I think, given the passage of time and all the other factors that the District Court could take into consideration, looking at the totality of the circumstances, it did resolve this conflict in the testimony by finding that they would have raised the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.535" offset="4098272">And I would suggest that based upon all the points that I have gone through, that finding is supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.688" offset="4122932">And again, I think the question under Rule 52(a), is that a plausible reading of the record, are the District Court's factfindings plausible, and I would submit that they certainly are, and that they are not clearly erroneous, and that the Eleventh Circuit, the key errors that the Eleventh Circuit made here was in rejecting the finding that it was clearly erroneous... excuse me, rejecting it without making the finding that it was clearly erroneous, and of course since it is supported by the record, it can't be done, and I would point out as well that nowhere has the state in either the Eleventh Circuit or before this Court argued that the factfindings of the District Court are clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.765" offset="4287190">And I think besides the one which we have touched upon or talked about, the tactical decision argument that the state has made based upon that selective use of Mr. Pryor's testimony, two other factfindings are critical, one, the discriminatory purpose of the plan, which really had not been contested until we got to this Court, and then second the concealment point, and I would like to just talk briefly about each of those, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.215" offset="4389067">For the first time in this Court the state says these are target figures, and at one point in their brief they even say there is no evidence as to the author, the purpose, or to whom this plan was submitted, and I just want to make it clear the evidence is uncontradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.509" offset="4450194">The clerk of the court, Mr. Dennis, testified that he received the note from the district attorney to the jury commissioners for the purpose of telling them how many blacks, women, and young people were to be put on the master jury lists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.202" offset="4516963">He as secretary of the commission communicated this knowledge to the chairman, and the testimony was that they followed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.958" offset="4547996">And indeed in the District Court the state conceded, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.279" offset="4569312">"intentional discrimination on the uncontroverted evidence that was produced in Bailey versus Vining. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.266" offset="4593240">which was the case in which this scheme first came to light, and of course the District Court findings in both the Bailey case and the District Court findings below in this case are that it was a plan to bring about intentional discrimination with the purpose of avoiding a prima facie case to set the level of discrimination at just such a place that it would insulate it from judicial review, and therefore deny litigants the opportunity to challenge it and be successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.369" offset="4717688">Really, the fundamental question, it seems, on this case, is who put this case in the posture that it is in today?</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.509" offset="4758230">Why is this claim brought to the District Court after the pretrial hearings and after the trial in state court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.930" offset="4787905">And the answer to that has to be the district attorney in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.150" offset="4804728">There is a lot of argument about whether the lawyers... what they wanted to do or should have looked have looked for a needle in a haystack over at the clerk's office, but the fact of the matter is, the district attorney knew exactly what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.792" offset="4851330">He could have stood up at arraignment and said, I just want to put on the record I have instructed the jury commission to underrepresent black people and women in the master list, and once everyone recovered from the shock, you would assume that the same thing would have happened there that happened when this came out in Bailey versus Vining before the District Court, and the District Court said, stop trying people for criminal cases until you revise your jury list there, because what you are doing is patently unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.859" offset="4967627">With regard to the concealment point, again, using this Court's language in the--</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.498" offset="6878119">He said somewhere in 30 years of documents this yellow sheet is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.835" offset="6895464">Obviously somebody in the clerk's office didn't realize that this wasn't for public consumption, but the fact that somebody's not very good at hiding the plan does not mean that it is readily discoverable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.410" offset="6949799">First of all, Mr. Amadeo's lawyers had no earthly reason to go over there and look for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.797" offset="6967353">The work product of the jury commission under Georgia law is secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.998" offset="6980205">It is not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.865" offset="6983653">The only thing you can get is the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.315" offset="6989400">Secondly, there was no basis for them to know that the district attorney in that case was not complying with Georgia law, federal law, the United States Constitution, the ethics of prosecutors, which say that he is to have no role at all in telling the jury commission how to go about its work, but certainly no role in telling them how to limit the participation of cognizable groups on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.233" offset="7085113">So there was no reason for them to go to the clerk's office and look for this needle in a haystack because they had no reason to know that it existed in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.237" offset="7113116">And finally, again, as I was pointing out earlier, just the nature of the plan itself was such that obviously, if you publish the fact that you are about discriminating on purpose, that plan is not going to survive for very long.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.812" offset="7167451">The whole nature of the plan was to discriminate, hide the discrimination from public view, insulate the discrimination from judicial review, and deny defendants any chance to challenge it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1805.912" offset="7375804">The overall strategy of the trial attorneys was to attempt to avoid the imposition of the death penalty on Mr. Amadeo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.066" offset="7404434">Mr. Amadeo had confessed, and they had him dead to rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.851" offset="7415614">The only thing they could do would try to be to obtain a sympathetic jury who would not impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.588" offset="7438497">In order to do this, of course, under Georgia law the only thing they really needed to try to concentrate on was to get one sympathetic person, because the death penalty has to be unanimous in Georgia, so their whole trial strategy throughout the entire proceeding was to attempt to avoid the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1847.655" offset="7542778">They went to local attorney Dallas Veal, who had practiced in this particular county for a very long time, and they went over name by name the people on the list to determine their characteristics and, as Mr. Lambert said, any significant factor that these particular jurors might have with reference to trying to avoid the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.033" offset="7620310">They went over the fact of their age, their sex, any job that they might have, and of course tried to determine their church preference based on some other particular factors they were trying to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.988" offset="7656150">One of the major reasons they believed and relied upon the jury as being beneficial to Mr. Amadeo is the fact that there was an active religious charismatic group in Putnam County that had a very large following, and in fact some of the members of that church had actually visited the petitioner in jail prior to his trial, and of course because of their conscientious objection to the death penalty and because of their sympathy toward the defendant, the attorneys both said that they wanted these people to be on the actual jury that would be drawn for the trial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.694" offset="7782896">Another consideration that they had, of course, was that the district attorney had served notice prior to trial that they would introduce other crimes, and the victims of the other crimes in Alabama were black persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.215" offset="7825005">There was violence against black persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.981" offset="7832111">there was a beating and a murder and a robbery of these black persons, and the attorneys feared that a jury which contained numerous black people might be unsympathetic to the 19-year-old white defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.273" offset="7877250">Not only this, they wanted to select jurors for the traverse array who might have children the same age as the petitioner or who might be mothers.</text>
