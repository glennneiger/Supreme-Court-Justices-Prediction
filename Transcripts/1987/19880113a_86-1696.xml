            <text syncTime="69.836" offset="412862">This case on writ certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Tenth Circuit concerns the timeliness of a charge filed with the EEOC pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.626" offset="464062">Respondent, Commercial Office Products Company, has refused to comply with an administrative subpoena issued by the EEOC pursuant to Title VII on the ground that the underlying discrimination charge was not timely filed with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.375" offset="519024">Whether the charge was timely filed depends on the answers to two different questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.449" offset="543265">First, on what date was the charge first filed with the EEOC; and second, what were the applicable statue limitations under Title VII, with respect to this particular charge?</text>
            <text syncTime="112.367" offset="582972">The answers to these two questions, in turn, depend on the meaning of two related provisions of Title VII, paragraphs C and E of Section 706.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.423" offset="627171">The first, Section 706(c) provides that where there are federal and state agencies with overlapping jurisdictions to remedy a certain employment discrimination practice, a charge alleging such a practice can not be filed with the EEOC until sixty days after state proceedings have commenced, unless such proceedings have earlier terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.116" offset="709927">The second provision, Section 706(e) provides that the normal 180-day federal limitations period does not apply in that circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3017.734" offset="12204431">--Not routinely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.476" offset="12215403">It takes the EEOC some time to process charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.089" offset="12229822">But what happens here is that jurisdiction is exclusive with the states for the first sixty days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.025" offset="12257617">The federal government can not act during that sixty-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.646" offset="12268065">If the charge is timely under state law and under federal law, after the sixty days pass, and assuming the state agency hasn't terminated it, there then is concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.724" offset="12316444">Both agencies can act simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.067" offset="12329819">Jurisdiction is sequential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.977" offset="12337447">State first, and then only if there has been now termination, it can be concurrent and both can act at the same pace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.154" offset="12374123">To completely answer your question, there are situations depending on how quickly the charge is filed after the allege discriminatory event that may, because of the formula, just not work out.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard J. Lazarus</label>
            <text syncTime="3085.161" offset="12474119">I just have a few points on rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.421" offset="12487181">First of all, the effect of the work-sharing agreement in this case is not to lengthen the statute limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.248" offset="12518528">It is to allow the charge to be filed immediately with the EEOC, and to avoid the sixty-day delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.584" offset="12539843">Whether the work-sharing agreement precludes the application of the 300-day limitations period is an issue which Respondent has not clearly raised in this case, but is raised in another case pending before the Court, on petitioner certiorari Dixon v. Westinghouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.382" offset="12599089">Second, not every charge submitted to the EEOC first is filed with the EEOC first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.617" offset="12627928">Under the work-sharing agreement, those charges originating one-hundred miles outside of Denver are, page 52(a):</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.842" offset="12664918">"Filed, processed first by the state agency. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.476" offset="12679442">There are other exceptions outlined on page 48(a) for charges that are received first by the EEOC that are nonetheless first processed by the state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.792" offset="12716640">The state agencies in this case have really done nothing more than reserve nominal jurisdiction based on the initial filing to reopen the matter later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.871" offset="12760944">They are not going to act, if at all, under the work-sharing agreement, until after the EEOC has acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.687" offset="12784245">Indeed, under Colorado Law, under, I think, Provision 24-34306-11, which is reprinted in the appendix to Respondent's petition, a Colorado agency is without jurisdiction to act 180 days after the charge is filed with the state agency if they haven't before then noticed a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.105" offset="12881943">If the Court concludes that the states must surrender their jurisdiction, but then somehow says that that doesn't prevent them from reopening it later, you'll really only be forcing the states to use different words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.494" offset="12943488">In effect, that is what the states have done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.596" offset="12955922">We don't believe that the word "terminate" precludes the states from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.530" offset="12971595">On the second issue, as Respondent concedes, the untimeliness under Colorado Law did not deprive the Colorado agency of jurisdiction to process the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.196" offset="13014332">Hence, it must be a deferral agency within the meaning of Section 706(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.009" offset="13029587">The Court made this clear in Oscar Mayer and related contexts, at page 763, when it said that the state limitations period did not preclude state proceedings from being commenced under the related provisions of the Age Discrimination Employment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.199" offset="13090296">If the Court doesn't have any further questions.</text>
