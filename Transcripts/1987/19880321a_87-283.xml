            <label>Ms. Terre Lee Rushton</label>
            <text syncTime="1407.026" offset="5747111">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.663" offset="5777727">The Respondent submits that the adoption by this Court of a rule which recognizes that attorney's fees are collateral to a judgement on the merits is the only rule which promotes uniformity, finality, judicial economy, and fairness to all the litigants in a federal court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.656" offset="5849616">We believe that the adoption of a rule recognizing that attorney's fees are, in fact, collateral to a judgement on the merits promotes several important policies of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.354" offset="5900398">It clarifies and eliminates guesswork over the timing of a federal court appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.602" offset="5921400">It makes uniform those procedures for appealing judgement and for making attorney's fees applications regardless of the source of the fees and avoids needless litigation over issues of finality and divergent interpretations of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.017" offset="5987124">Now, the Petitioner seeks to avoid the decision of the Tenth Circuit by claiming that because this is a diversity action and because he perceives a conflict between federal procedure and state law, that state law should govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.682" offset="6053789">The first question, then, to be addressed by the Court is, in fact, whether the timeliness of the federal appeal is governed by federal law and we think that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.913" offset="6094644">The right to appeal, of course, is created by federal statute 28 U.S.C. 1291, which provides that final decisions of the District court may be entertained by the federal Appellate courts and it's implemented by the federal Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure, specifically Rule 4(a)(1) which provides that the notice of appeal shall be filed with the Appellate Court thirty days after entry of a final judgement on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.103" offset="6215435">An entry of judgement is defined in federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6) by reference to the federal Rules of Civil Procedure 58 and 79.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.333" offset="6260365">Those rules set forth the entire mechanism for processing an appeal through the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.470" offset="6296937">The purpose of the rule is to let all parties know when the judgement is ready for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.015" offset="6323059">They encompass the procedure for a federal appeal, and we believe that those federal rules are intended to occupy the field, explicitly or implicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.494" offset="6369035">There is no room for the operation of a conflicting state court procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.069" offset="6391291">We also believe that the application of the federal Rules of Appellate and Civil Procedure in this case do not transgress either the Constitutional restrictions that this Court has recognized nor any statutory restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.345" offset="6452418">The rules regulating the timing of an appeal in the federal court are indisputably procedural rules and, therefore, a priori, Constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.918" offset="6494736">They do not enlarge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.059" offset="6503304">They do not embridge and they do not modify any state-created entitlement to damages in this action nor to fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.194" offset="6543846">It merely regulates the procedure for enforcing that right in the federal system.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1613.911" offset="6574671">Well, that's true but they don't give us limitless discretion as to how to regulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.064" offset="6603301">For example, you're right that it's more efficient not to make the District court resolve an issue that may be irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.640" offset="6633603">But we certainly cannot allow an initial appeal in, let's say in an ordinary misrepresentation case where the Plaintiff has to prove a falsehood and reliance on the falsehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.071" offset="6687311">Now, we can't allow an appeal of the first part whether there was a falsity simply by saying, well, it will save our District courts time--</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.504" offset="6889080">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.754" offset="6890021">Sir, we simply don't believe that this is under the same stricture, that it doesn't create the same kind of problems that other cases coming before this Court under the Collateral Order doctrine create.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.968" offset="6938922">This is a situation that's purely mechanical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.967" offset="6950938">It talks about the way to enforce rights and doesn't intend to bifurcate the entitlement to those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.182" offset="6979778">There's a decision on the merits that can be appealed and there's a right to attorney's fees which can also be appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.507" offset="7005064">But I think both the Colorado legislature and this Court have directed that they are to be appealed in a particular manner and a manner which we do not believe abridges any of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.863" offset="7046442">Rule 54(d) and 58 have been amended to address what we believe is the conflict present herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.625" offset="7081551">We believe that the federal rules govern that question by designating that where, as here, these attorney's fees are to be taxed as cost of the action there's a Congressional history that shows that they should be separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.321" offset="7144349">The practical considerations also dictate that there's a uniform rule in the federal courts whether these matters arise under a federal claim or by diversity of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.661" offset="7185622">For example, under Rule 58 fees, we believe, are costs and it is clear that when Rule 58 was amended in 1946 costs were determined not to delay the entry of judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.202" offset="7247794">That distinction between the costs of an action and the merits of an action applies particularly to attorney's fees, which are both practically distinct from the merits of an action and philosophically distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.212" offset="7303905">They are practically distinct because as we've touched upon it depends on the determination of the prevailing, or winning, party, as the Colorado statute puts it and, also, that costs accrue throughout the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.223" offset="7355941">And a final judgement on costs can't be made until, in fact, there is a final judgement on the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.625" offset="7381541">They are philosophically distinct because attorney's fees are compensation for the costs of going through the litigation, not as compensation for the wrong that the Plaintiff alleges was done to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.948" offset="7446847">We believe that the drafters of Rule 58 intended to include attorney's fees as costs and that this delay that would attend the Petitioner's interpretation of this problem is exactly the problem that Rule 58 was designed to avoid by separating determinations on costs from determinations on merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.953" offset="7538798">However, if this Court would decline to find that attorney's fees are costs, we still believe that this fee determination should be found to be collateral to a judgement on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.527" offset="7589162">This Court declined in the case--</text>

            <text syncTime="1968.938" offset="7994791">Because that's what we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.906" offset="8002628">The issue of finality that we're talking about here is final for purposes of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.513" offset="8021123">A decision by this Court that attorney's fees are collateral we don't believe would affect the Petitioner's entitlement to fees in any aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.776" offset="8062083">I think it would leave the right to fees that's present in the Colorado Wage Claim Act intact, but it would allow all litigants who seek those fees to apply definitive, unambiguous rules to determine when the time for appeal begins to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.442" offset="8124777">Now, following the White, the Circuit courts have taken two divergent approaches to attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.141" offset="8155601">The one adopted by the Tenth Circuit and applied in Cox v. Flood is the collateral or bright line approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.778" offset="8186112">And, again, we believe that approach has the advantage of doing away with any uncertainty regarding the time for appeal, allowing the prompt entry of judgement, the prompt execution of judgement, and the running of post-judgement interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.804" offset="8242223">It also separates and recognizes what may be ethical problems in an unholy alliance of the merits decisions and the fee questions, involving as they do very different issues and very different considerations for the lawyer and the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.876" offset="8306484">If this Court, however, is concerned with the idea of piecemeal litigation to independent appeals several of the circuits have postured that local rules and the adoption of local rules would solve those problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.434" offset="8360715">Rules, for instance, that set deadlines for filing attorney's fees applications, that made prompt determination of attorney's fees easy, and perhaps expanded the rules on consolidation of a decision on the merits and appeal of the decision on the merits with the appeal of a decision on attorney's fees in the Circuit courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.564" offset="8445247">On the other hand, the ad hoc approach that appears to be advocated by the Petitioner in this case creates a deal of uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.139" offset="8483595">As the Court's questions have indicated, there is a concern with further litigation over state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.074" offset="8511284">Not only would each state have to come to a decision, but each statute in each state would have to be examined to determine whether the right to attorney's fees was integral or collateral and, therefore, when the Appellate time began to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.239" offset="8575964">This would be a particular problem in those cases, such as Bilmar v. IGF Drilling which is a case cited in our brief, where the entitlement to fees arises both under a federal statute and under a state law claim and, therefore, may be subject to different Appellate times and to a very difficult determination, at the least, as to how the attorney's fees were awarded and how they should be appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.431" offset="8684738">I think that this case illustrates the problems in the ad hoc approach where we are here before this Court with still a divergent interpretation of what Colorado law says about the attorney's fees entitlement under the Colorado Wage Claim Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.784" offset="8754119">Although the Petitioner has cited several cases to this Court, only that case decided in December of 1987 speaks at all to the issues of finality and appealability as they affect attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.199" offset="8811797">The other cases cited reflect entirely different statutes and, perhaps, we would suggest, entirely different considerations about appealability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.227" offset="8851921">Those are the problems that the adoption of a collateral rule, a bright line rule, that says all attorney's fees are collateral would avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.270" offset="8892150">We believe, however, that regardless of the approach adopted by this Court these fees would be collateral under either of the approaches adopted by the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.185" offset="8943768">These are statutory, as distinguished from contractual fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.482" offset="8961009">They are found in a separate statutory provision from that which allows damages under the Colorado Wage Claim Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.775" offset="8990161">They were never raised, the request for attorney's fees was never raised in the complaint nor in any part of the action on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.085" offset="9019418">They are directed to be taxed as costs by the Colorado statute and they were, in fact, treated as costs by the court and by the parties to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.752" offset="9066021">They were first raised in Petitioner's bill of cost, subsequent to the entry of the judgement on the merits, and his right to those fees was supported in his memorandum supporting attorney's fees as costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.636" offset="9121609">Finally, Your Honors, the Petitioner requests that if this Court finds that his attorney's fees request was, indeed, collateral and, therefore, his appeal of the judgement on the merits was untimely that any decision of this Court be applied perspectively only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.627" offset="9205515">First, we believe this Court has already spoken in the case of Firestone Tire and Rubber Company v. Risjord that because when a court lacks discretion to even hear the issue, as the Tenth Circuit did to hear the untimely appeal on the merits, that ruling can never be made perspective only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.980" offset="9278971">But if, in fact, this Court does consider the question of prospectivity, we believe that the equities justifying an exception to the rule on retroactivity are not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.788" offset="9330171">This is not a matter of first impression in this Court nor in the Tenth Circuit, being clearly foreshadowed by this Court's decision in White v. New Hampshire and the Tenth Circuit's determination in Cox v. Flood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.423" offset="9380744">The application of this rule to the Petitioner herein doesn't retard the purposes behind the rule and there clearly is no reliance by the Petitioner on this position, when throughout the course of the litigation he has treated these attorney's fees as costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.259" offset="9460052">In conclusion, we would urge that this Court adopt a rule that finds that fees are collateral to a judgement on the merits and that the time for filing a notice of appeal is thirty days from the entry of the judgement on the merits regardless of the pendancy of an attorney's fees request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.374" offset="9536538">We believe that decision can be reached whether this Court decides that attorney's fees are costs pursuant to Rule 58 or whether they are collateral because of their separate and independent nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.965" offset="9586902">We believe that that rule would promote the policies of this Court and establish uniform federal rules for processing appeals, and is the only rule that is truly fair to litigants in the federal court system.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Frank</label>
            <text syncTime="2384.254" offset="9656075">Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.566" offset="9677286">I would just like to correct one statement made by Appellee's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.798" offset="9698184">We finally taxed our attorney's fees as a bill of cost on Page 29 of the record of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.687" offset="9721799">We also filed a motion for attorney's fees directed to the court's attention because, quite frankly, at that point we didn't know whether attorney's fees were going to be costs or whether attorney's fees were part of the substantive merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.618" offset="9785538">So, we did both of that within the ten days required by Rule 59, under both the federal rules and Colorado state rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.692" offset="9817825">In essence, this case boils down to the issue of whether the federal Appellate Rule 4(a) dominates the field, occupies the field, and precludes a state from having the ability to do the following, which is the Basset case in the Appendix of our reply brief:</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.777" offset="9918135">The jury returned its verdict on November 5th, 1982 but the court did not reduce Plaintiff's claim for attorney's fees to judgement until June 25th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.210" offset="9951885">Pursuant to the provisions of CRCP... those are our Rules of Procedure... 54(a) and 58(a), therefore the amounts awarded by the jury remained subject to revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.814" offset="9998279">And until the court finally entered judgement on Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees, no judgement... underlined, the court's emphasis... can be considered to have been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.718" offset="10037880">In essence, Hanna v. Plumber, Erie, and most recently this Court in the Burlington Northern Railroad case, the initial step is to determine whether when fairly construed the scope of the federal rule is sufficiently broad to cause a direct collision with the state law or implicitly has to be interpreted to occupy the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.613" offset="10145505">We submit that, in this case, it is not and that the Erie line of cases should be followed and that the Colorado procedure should be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.030" offset="10191167">If there are no further questions, thank you.</text>
