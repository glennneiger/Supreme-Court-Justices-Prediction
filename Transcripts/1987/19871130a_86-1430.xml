            <text syncTime="917.760" offset="3808116">The cases in the State of Texas say that if we go in on that collateral attack and say that this judgment that is before you all today is void, they will say this is a collateral attack like they did in the Austin School District case.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.880" offset="3860570">This is a collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.021" offset="3865063">The case recites on its face the service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.799" offset="3880214">Therefore, you cannot collateral it and you must bring a bill of review proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.689" offset="3895783">So, we have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.455" offset="3902888">That is the law in the State of Texas at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.141" offset="3913546">So, we have followed the law and because we have been forced into this,... you see, it's a Catch-22.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.373" offset="3938519">Are we not to be able to object on this end of the Catch-22 and may we only object on that end of the Catch-22?</text>

            <text syncTime="962.556" offset="3987212">If the procedure in bill of review says unless you show a meritorious defense, and this Court has ruled on several occasions, in Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works as well as Armstrong v. Manzo, that we do not have to show a meritorious defense, then this procedure is defective and must be ruled unconstitutional by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.110" offset="4061504">If the Court then... since it is to the other area, if the Court... if we then go not on collateral attack but in just our other issues, we don't have to bring collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.404" offset="4102673">See, if we win here, there is no necessity to bring a collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.106" offset="4117406">My other case is not a collateral attack on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.198" offset="4129840">This other case has to deal with a second deed from the same person, from the lender to the same person, and this Court should distinguish those two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.490" offset="4171009">It just so happens to be that because of the status of the law in trespass to try title, that I will automatically be defeated on that because I will have to prove on behalf of my client that not only was the deed from the trustee to... from the trustee in the lender's situation to the Chinns, not only was that void, but also every other impediment on our title, whether it's this or any other judgment that an execution is issued on, is also against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.024" offset="4305069">We must remove that from the record in order for us to succeed on this other case, and that's why the other case was brought.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce Ian Schimmel</label>
            <text syncTime="3310.571" offset="13379277">I am not familiar with that, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.116" offset="13393487">I do not know whether or not they do or do not have that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.523" offset="13403100">No one has asked me to brief it, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.867" offset="13408534">I would also like to close by stating Texas gives great lip service in its cases to say that, in fact, you can bring collateral attacks, yet not one of the collateral attacks that has ever been brought and cited to you in these cases has ever succeeded, except this one case that was improperly decided, Commander v. Bryan, and even that case was not appealed to the Supreme Court of the State of Texas, so it's not stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.685" offset="13507799">It was relied on by the dissent in the case that did go to the Supreme Court of the State of Texas, McEwen v. Harrison, where they said the exact opposite, and ultimately its ultimate judgment shows the poverty of legal thinking in that case because it says that you can attack a case over and over and over again that's void on its face and have no res judicata effect, which is entirely in opposite with Joiner v. Vasquez, which was cert. denied by this Court and which the Supreme Court of Texas said the exact opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.734" offset="13639979">Once you do submit to the procedure, you're bound by it, even if they didn't have jurisdiction over you before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.420" offset="13662653">If you make a bill of review and you lose that bill of review, you must appeal it all the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.246" offset="13686059">You cannot bring a separate bill of review proceeding or separate collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.509" offset="13703091">It's res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.509" offset="13707061">So, that case is simply not right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.431" offset="13718764">Also, it is a subject matter jurisdiction case and not a personal jurisdiction case, and the judgment in that case shows on its face that the Court had subject matter jurisdiction... it did not have subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.830" offset="13772367">The Attorney General of the State of Texas starts his brief from a wrong point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.595" offset="13791385">He states that the face of this judgment is void when, in fact, the face of the judgment is not void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.796" offset="13812178">The face of this judgment shows the exact opposite and recites that service was properly made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.340" offset="13830359">So, anything that is stated by the State of Texas beyond that point, based upon that premise, cannot be correct, and the cases that they cite to you, I would hold, simply are not the law in the State of Texas, and the portion of their case where they say you can bring a collateral attack has not one case cited, has not one case cited, and this whole procedure that we've gone through here, nobody on the opposition or amicus has cited to this case where there has been a collateral attack where the judgment comes from inside the State of Texas, not from outside the State of Texas, where the issue was did you serve the defendant and the answer was no, and they said you can collaterally attack this, not where there is a recitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.044" offset="13993154">They cannot do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.620" offset="13999528">It does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.229" offset="14005902">This is our only method of attack and for that reason, we respectfully ask the Court to rule in our favor.</text>
