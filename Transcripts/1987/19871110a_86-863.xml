            <text syncTime="66.958" offset="399039">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="69.827" offset="410533">At issue in this case is a decision in the Health Care Financing Administration, a unit in the Department of Health and Human Services disapproving a proposed amendment to California's state Medicaid plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.302" offset="460375">The question is ultimately one of statutory construction: did the Administrator properly conclude that the California amendment violates the plain and unequivocal language of Section 1903(f) of the Medicaid Act, or is there some escape route from this conclusion, as the Court of Appeals found, and as the Respondents maintain?</text>
            <text syncTime="101.616" offset="537593">Section 1903(f) provides that when a state elects to participate in a Medicaid program, the federal government will reimburse the state only for families whose income after medical expenses falls below a certain cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.375" offset="596630">Section 1903(f) sets that cap at 4/3rds the highest amount ordinarily paid by the state under the AFDC program to a family of the same size having no income or resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.884" offset="650755">In other words, if the highest amount ordinarily paid to an AFDC family of two, without any income and resources is $300 a month, then the cap on federal financial participation for a family of two would be $400 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.894" offset="710732">In September 1983 California submitted an amendment to its Medicaid plan to the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.064" offset="743438">The amendment provided that for adult couples and only for adult couples, that the medically needy income level would be 4/3rds the highest amount ordinarily paid to an AFDC family of three.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.289" offset="792339">In its application, which we have reproduced at page 24 of the Joint Appendix, California admitted that the new standard for adult couples exceeded the federal cap by $142 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.116" offset="839673">The State also indicated by crossing out a notation at the bottom of the page that it did not have a method of excluding these excess payments from future requests for federal reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.804" offset="882409">The Administrator promptly rejected the proposed amendment as violating both section 1903(f) and the Secretary's implementing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.410" offset="912816">This, we submit, was clearly correct: Section 1903(f) imposes a limit on financial participation based on a fixed numerical relationship on a level of benefits ordinarily paid to an AFDC family of the same size.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.587" offset="969554">The Secretary's regulations expressly provide that this limit applies to couples.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.372" offset="988675">California, however, proposed to set its medically needy income level for couples based on the amount paid to a family of three.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.126" offset="1015634">An adult couple is a family of two; a family of two is not the same size as a family of three.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.946" offset="1038935">Thus, the California amendment, as the Administrator properly found, violated the plain terms of the statute and the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.535" offset="1069341">The fact that the statute gives the Secretary authority to prescribe standards does not change this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.272" offset="1096300">The Secretary is empowered only to set standards for determining the amount of benefits ordinarily paid to a family of a given size.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.545" offset="1125348">He is not empowered to set standards for determining what "same size" means.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.430" offset="1144888">In any event, the Secretary has exercised the delegated authority given by Section 1903(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="259.067" offset="1167457">The Secretary's regulations, which remained unchanged in this respect since 1971, state that the cap on federal financial participation is to be determined for any given family, including adult couples, by looking to the amount ordinarily received by an AFDC family of the same size.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.445" offset="1232972">Thus, if there were any doubt about the meaning of the statute created by the delegation to set standards to the Secretary, it is in Judge Kozinski's phrase, "neatly excised by the regulations".</text>
            <text syncTime="289.353" offset="1288561">Three arguments have been advanced in this case in an effort to defeat the plain import of this statute and the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.608" offset="1317609">First the Ninth Circuit held that the California Amendment was authorized by a provision contained in a 1979 internal agency manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.964" offset="1351046">And that this manual was a legislative regulation binding on the Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.499" offset="1369227">Second, the respondents maintain that, even if the manual was not a legislative regulation, it was at least a valid guideline and as such is entitled to deference by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.807" offset="1414367">Third, both the courts of appeals and the Respondent claim that Congress, when it enacted the Deficit Reduction Act in 1984, intended to permit the California amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.763" offset="1454282">I would address each of these three contentions in turn:</text>
            <text syncTime="334.215" offset="1468074">The primary theory of the court of appeals was that a certain manual provision, the so-called ROM 2572-D, was a legislative regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.522" offset="1509243">No one seeks to defend this theory in this Court and with good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.457" offset="1521051">The manual provision in question is part of a loose-leaf manual intended by use by Agency employees only.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.711" offset="1549994">It was not approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the only person in the Agency who has the authority to issue substantive regulations; it was not issued after public notice and comment procedures as is required by the APA and longstanding Agency policy; it was not published in the Code of Federal Regulations; indeed, it was not even published in the Federal Register, the requisite for all substantive regulations under the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.643" offset="1645707">The Court of Appeals Rationale simply cannot be squared with fundamental tenets of administrative law.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.880" offset="1666710">As Judge Kozinski put it,</text>
            <text syncTime="385.832" offset="1674546">"it would create uncertainty; breed litigation; and invite judicial intrusion into the affairs of administrative agencies. "</text>
            <text syncTime="392.003" offset="1699206">Although they disclaim any reliance on the court of appeals theory, Respondents nevertheless argue that the manual provision is a valid guideline, and as such, is entitled to deference by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.628" offset="1741733">We agree that Agency manuals can be important sources for resolving legal disputes that arise under the Social Security Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.685" offset="1805890">There is no indication that the so-called ROM provision&gt; ["] was in fact ever applied in any particular case involving any state, let alone this State.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.677" offset="1845910">When the provision was drawn to the attention of the Administrator in this State it was promptly disavowed and the Administrator consistently held that it violated the State statute and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.883" offset="1882690">There is a reference in the ROM to the State of Montana, but there is no evidence that we can locate that Montana in fact ever attempted to set its medically need income level based on a family of three for couples rather than two.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.292" offset="1944339">The contention that somehow the courts should give deference to the ROM provision in this case, even if it is not a legislatively binding regulation, we do not think bears any scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.052" offset="2007346">The decision in this case was not one to enforce the ROM.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.270" offset="2020303">The decision was one to repudiate the manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.289" offset="2032319">In this context, if the manual is not a legislatively-binding regulation, then the only questions it presented are whether the Agency adopted a rational construction of its own statute and regulations, and in light of that interpretation, whether its decision to repudiate the manual is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.750" offset="2098148">We do not think there can be any serious dispute about the answers to these inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.119" offset="2115702">Even if one somehow imagines that Section 1903(f) creates an ambiguity and allows the Secretary to determine that "same size" means that a couple is different from a family of two, the Administrator did not interpret this statute that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.181" offset="2183934">The Administrator in this case found that the same size family means what it says, that a "couple" is a "family of two", and not a "family of three".</text>
            <text syncTime="521.770" offset="2218311">This was clearly a rational construction of the statute and once that construction was made it followed as a matter of course that the Agency manual had to be repudiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.827" offset="2262510">An Agency manual simply cannot trump a duly-enacted statute of Congress or a duly-promulgated Agency regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.831" offset="2290514">Nor do we think there can be any contention in this case that California relied to its detriment on the Agency manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.585" offset="2321547">In April 1983, the California Department of Health Services prepared an analysis of proposed legislation that ultimately led to the State plan amendment at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.077" offset="2379539">That analysis noted that,</text>
            <text syncTime="563.946" offset="2386958">"regional office manual provisions have no regulatory authority. "</text>
            <text syncTime="567.564" offset="2401482">and it cautioned that,</text>
            <text syncTime="568.448" offset="2404930">"federal approval would very likely not be granted. "</text>
            <text syncTime="571.600" offset="2417573">Later in August 1983, the same California Department again concluded that the California Amendment was in violation of the federal cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.122" offset="2447666">To make doubly sure, the California department wrote to the Administrator and asked for a formal Opinion about whether or not the proposed plan would be acceptable under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.264" offset="2492283">The Administrator wrote back in September of 1983 and unequivocally informed the Department that its proposed plan would violate Section 1903(f) and the implementing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.036" offset="2527288">Notwithstanding these repeated warnings, that the manual provision was unlawful and that the proposed plan amendment would be disapproved, California filed its amendment anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.523" offset="2561247">We would submit that this history demonstrates that, although California was no doubt attempting to exploit the manual, it was not in any sense relying on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.729" offset="2594056">The final argument that has been advanced for avoiding the plain language of Section 1903(f) in the regulations is based on the so-called DEFRA moratorium&gt; ["].</text>
            <text syncTime="625.318" offset="2632404">Section 2373 of the Deficit Reduction Act, or DEFRA&gt; ["], directs the Secretary not to take any compliance action against a state by reason of the state's medicaid plan being in violation of a certain provision of the medicaid statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.661" offset="2689874">The section that is referred to in the moratorium is the subsection of Section 1902(a) of the medicaid statute, a provision that had been added by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 or TEFRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.254" offset="2744208">The moratorium does not mention Section 1903(f), the 4/3rds cap on federal financial participation which was relied upon by the Administrator in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.610" offset="2781616">So the short answer to the DEFRA moratorium argument, and we think the complete answer, is that the moratorium concerns a different statutory requirement not relied upon by the Administrator and is simply irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.084" offset="2823516">The legislative history confirms this analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.036" offset="2843369">The primary purpose of the DEFRA moratorium, as the legislative history makes clear, was to give the states greater flexibility in measuring income and resources in determining medicaid eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.177" offset="2883911">As this Court explained in its Opinion in Adkins v Rivera, TEFRA required the states to use the same methodology in measuring and resources for all goods of medicaid recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.235" offset="2928110">DEFRA imposed a moratorium on this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.103" offset="2943575">This case does not present any issue about measurement of income and resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.139" offset="2959771">It concerns only the cap on federal financial participation that applies after the measurement process is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.543" offset="2985371">TEFRA also required the states to use a single standard of eligibility requirements for all groups of medicaid recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.482" offset="3021106">After TEFRA was enacted, some agency employees, although not the Administrator, interpreted the single standard to mean, among other things, that the states had to set the same eligibility requirements for families consisting of one adult and a child and families consisting of two adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.860" offset="3086621">If this were the correct interpretation, then the DEFRA moratorium would mean that states could now set different eligibility standards for adult couples and families consisting of one adult and a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.932" offset="3126954">But just because the states can set different relative standards for families consisting of two adults and families consisting of an adult and a child does not mean that either standard can correlate the cap set by section 1403(f)... 1903(f), excuse me, of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.309" offset="3184424">To return to my earlier example, if the amount ordinarily paid to an AFDC family of two is $300, and the Section 1903(f) cap for a family of two is therefore $400, DEFRA would permit a state to set the medically needy income level for an adult couple at $400, and to set the medically needy income level for a family consisting of one adult and a child at something lower, such as $350.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.793" offset="3282331">But there is nothing in DEFRA that permits states to violate the federal cap either for adult couples or for any other type of family.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.030" offset="3311274">If there were any doubt at all about this it has been resolved by a recent amendment to the DEFRA moratorium enacted just this past August designed to clarify which provisions of the Medicaid Act are covered by the moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.420" offset="3356832">This enactment is not simply a post-enactment legislative history because Congress specifically made the effective date of the clarification retroactive back to the date of the enactment of DEFRA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1145.353" offset="4712587">Alternatively, it can increase medicaid benefits for adult couples and can arrange to pay for the excess benefits above the federal cap itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1182.259" offset="4860231">The judgment of the Ninth Circuit was based on two separate and independent determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.180" offset="4887921">It is that second determination that I would like to discuss with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.734" offset="4902132">That is the moratorium, because in our view, the moratorium should be the dispositive issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.756" offset="4938181">In June 1984, Congress enacted the Deficit Reduction Act, DEFRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.993" offset="4963154">And Section 2373(c) of that Act provides the 18-month moratorium that the Solicitor-General was just discussing with you in his opening argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.199" offset="5004009">We believe that Congress meant in enacting that moratorium to authorize on a time-limited basis, states' use of medically-needy income levels for adult couples set at 133.33 percent of the AFDC grant for three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.595" offset="5081541">And we believe that is so for two reasons:</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.881" offset="5098677">First, the issue that was before Congress as it enacted the DEFRA moratorium, was the reversal by HHF... HHS, of its policy embodied in ROM-2572.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.879" offset="5302745">The principal holding I think that you are referring to, Justice Rehnquist, was the Ninth Circuit giving legal force and effect to the ROM in the same status as one would in a duly-promulgated regulation and/or statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.506" offset="5369201">Yes, we are taking a different view, as we indicated in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.708" offset="5382053">We have not taken that position in defending that determination in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.429" offset="5404936">Our view is that ROM-2572, as our view was, incidently, before the Ninth Circuit, and before the Secretary in the administrative process, that this ROM was an interpretive guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.522" offset="5461256">However, in the medicaid program that... it is a joint federal and state program, and that under Section 201.3, particularly subsection D, the Secretary's own regulation provides that when state plans are evaluated or approved by the Secretary or whomever she has delegated... or he, has delegated to that task, that guidelines are referred to in determining what the regulations that the Secretary has promulgated, really mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.731" offset="5610154">So that when we look at the regulation that exist with respect to the amount of cap on the federal financial participation, it is indeed under the Secretary's regulations for purposes of approving state plans altogether appropriate to look at what their policy interpretation has been of what that regulation means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.744" offset="5702105">And that is what ROM-2572 was and that is what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.048" offset="5719346">It interprets the Secretary's own regulation to say that in the case of adult couples, you could have a medically-needy income level set at an AFDC level of three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.272" offset="5768248">And the reason that that ROM determined that that was appropriate was that one could determine that in the case of two adults, particularly elderly adults, it simply costs more for them to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.580" offset="5821537">That is what a maintenance need income level really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.365" offset="5832613">And you could reasonably determine, and the State has the flexibility to reasonably determine that it costs an elderly couple more to live per month than it does for a parent and one child.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.439" offset="6200940">Indeed, we think Congress specifically reaffirmed that regulation, or that policy interpretation, when it adopted the DEFRA moratorium, because the issue that was before the Conference Committee was made clear in the Conference Committee Report, and in... before we refer to that Report we have to have... in April 1983, HHS had promulgated a policy letter to all regions, and that is at Appendix B to our Brief in Opposition to the Petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.416" offset="6368855">In that letter, for the first time, HHS takes the view that, in light of Congress' enactment of TEFRA and the TEFRA, that states could no longer set adult couple income levels at 133.33 percent of the grant for three, as provided in ROM-2572, and that letter specifically states ROM-2572 because of the enactment of TEFRA and the TEFRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.391" offset="6520783">That 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.362" offset="6540636">That is the same section that is referred to in the DEFRA moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.814" offset="6558399">And then when you refer to the Conference Committee Report to determine what was the issue, what was the problem that they thought they were addressing in adopting the moratorium, the language that the Conference Committee used is almost identical in addressing... in articulating, the issue that is addressed in that 1983 all-regions letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.697" offset="6649932">When the Conference Committee says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.648" offset="6657769">"similarly, the Department has taken the position. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.666" offset="6669890">it is exactly that letter that was sent out to all of the policy regions some few months before that Congress was referring to and that Conference Committee Report reiterates what the Secretary's position was as it was stated, or I should say, the Department's position, as it was stated in that all-regions policy letter, that in light of Congress' enactment of the TEFRA, states could no longer set maintenance need income levels for adult couples because that would result in a different medically needy income level among groups of the same family size, depending upon the relative numbers of adults and childrens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.093" offset="6843552">So it is almost the same language that was used by the Department in their all-regions policy letter in April 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.147" offset="9887758">We think the Conference Committee's statements itself are abundantly clear as to what it wanted done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.366" offset="9904685">But it seems, it is given additional clarity by reference over to the House Report, because the House Report only dealt with this one specific issue and was longer and more explanatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.490" offset="9953168">But we think standing on its own the Conference Committee Report itself makes clear that they wanted... they were reversing the Department's reversal of its policy set out in ROM-2572.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.833" offset="10010533">Now, the second reason that we think that the moratorium authorizes California to set its income levels at 133.33 percent of the grant for three is that the Secretary's interpretation would require not only disregarding the intent of the Conference Committee as it is set out in the Conference Committee Report issue now... yes, Sir?</text>

            <text syncTime="2525.936" offset="10234873">Because it is the Secretary's view that all of the moratorium, as concerns adult couple income levels authorizes, is the setting of an adult couple income level at 133.33 percent of the grant... the AFDC grant, for two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.748" offset="10314181">All other income levels would be set below that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.385" offset="10332675">It is just that interpretation and giving states that kind of flexibility that Congress specifically rejected in TEFRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.991" offset="10375098">In September 1981, in reaction to the adoption of OBRA, the Secretary promulgated... HHS promulgated, proposed regulations that would have authorized states, given states, the flexibility of setting a separate income level for each medically needy group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.071" offset="10455451">Those that were SSI related, the aged, blind and disabled, could be set in relation to the SSI cash grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.860" offset="10486589">Those that were AFDC length, could have been set at the AFDC level, Because AFDC cash grants are traditionally lower than an SSI grant, the income level that could have resulted under that proposed regulation would have been for an AFDC-linked family to have a lower medically-needy income level than the SSI-linked groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.994" offset="10599124">That is specifically what Congress rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.481" offset="10613126">And it says specifically so in the House Report on TEFRA when it enacted the single-standard requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2633.622" offset="10665684">And that, it seems to me that if that is what it had been to accomplish by this moratorium, and Congress, would have said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.846" offset="10710615">"we are now reversing our own selves of what we had said just less than two years before when we enacted TEFRA. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.550" offset="10741335">To the contrary, Congress is saying in its enacting the moratorium,</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.504" offset="10765159">"states are to be given the flexibility of using less restrictive eligibility criteria, and in the case of adult couple income levels, to set that medically-needy income level at 133.33 percent of the AFDC grant for three. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.937" offset="10850945">because that is what was authorized in ROM-2572 and we believe they reaffirmed that policy in the moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.840" offset="10882501">Had they meant to reject their own determination in TEFRA, they certainly would have said so, particularly in a moratorium, which I think we can all agree, is at least abundantly clear in the fact that it wants to give the states greater and more flexibility to use less restrictive... which means higher... income standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.789" offset="10970376">We think, in conclusion, that looking at the issue that was before the Conference Committee, that issue was HHS's rejection... or reversal, of its own policy set out in ROM-2572, and in looking at the ramifications of what the Secretary's position is, that we think it is quite clear that the Congress meant to provide first the reaffirmation of ROM-2572: states can use 133.33 percent of the AFDC grant for three, and certainly the Secretary's interpretation would be unreasonable in light of Congress' rejection of just that interpretation when it enacted DEFRA.</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.254" offset="12216208">First of all, the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration consistently stated that the California proposal violated Section 1903(f) and the Secretary's implementing regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3049.171" offset="12327908">Secondly, although the House passed a bill which disapproved the Secretary's repudiation of the ROM, the House bill was never enacted into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.427" offset="12360927">The relevant passage in the Conference Report, which is reproduced in our brief on pages 44 and 45, is quite explicit: it describes the present law as being the cap set by Section 1903(f); it states that the House bill permits the states to establish medically-needy levels for families of two adults up to the 133.33 percent of the three-person AFDC standard; it says that the Senate had no provision, and describes the Conference Agreement as follows:</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.149" offset="12907826">--If there were no moratorium on the Secretary disapproving state plans for that reason, yes, it would be our position that it violates that, quite clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.655" offset="12941785">But DEFRA had been enacted by the time the Administrator had reached her final decision in this case, and in the final decision of the Administrator there was no reliance whatsoever on TEFRA or the "single-standard" provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.879" offset="12990687">The sole reliance was based on 1903(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.033" offset="13007301">The other argument that is put forward in several different versions by California is that, somehow, what the Secretary is doing in this case violates the provision of TEFRA, which stated that the Secretary was to go back to pre-OBRA regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.578" offset="13081488">The logic of this completely escapes me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.114" offset="13095594">Because, the DEFRA moratorium as it has been discussed, puts a moratorium on TEFRA, and I do not understand how a statute that puts a moratorium on TEFRA can then be transposed into a statement that somehow, a provision of TEFRA has to be governing in this particular case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.527" offset="13173335">In any event, even if we do go back to the pre-OBRA regulations, the pre-OBRA regulations are 42 C.F.R. 435.1007, which has been in effect in the current form since 1971, and which is the regulation which the Secretary relied upon in this case in disapproving California's state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.172" offset="13251911">The ROM is not a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.441" offset="13260897">The ROM is a statement that appears in an internal Agency manual; it has none of the indicia of a valid regulation, and has never been regarded as a regulation.</text>
