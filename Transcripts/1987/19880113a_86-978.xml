            <text syncTime="67.708" offset="408757">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.576" offset="424326">This case is here on certiorari to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.897" offset="445537">The case involves Minnesota's operation of the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.932" offset="465704">There are two issues raised by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.170" offset="482631">First, does an applicant publicity regulation of the Secretary of Health and Human Services require a state to single out one of the myriad eligibility requirements of the AFDC program?</text>
            <text syncTime="100.077" offset="538324">And require a state to give repeated, detailed, written notice of that one requirement to all applicants and recipients?</text>
            <text syncTime="109.285" offset="575105">Minnesota and the Secretary argue that the Secretary's regulations requires states to generally publicize the AFDC program and its eligibility requirements to applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.109" offset="630380">The second issue is equally significant to Minnesota and to other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.096" offset="658383">Can a court apply an information regulation of the Secretary in a way that effectively modifies Congress' eligibility requirements?</text>
            <text syncTime="140.285" offset="699134">Can the court require the state to pay AFDC benefits to a person who is without dispute ineligible to receive those benefits under Congress' eligibility statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="152.961" offset="749812">A divided panel of the Eighth Circuit required the state to pay such benefits to an ineligible person.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.715" offset="780845">And enjoined the state from recovering over-payments made to that ineligible person even though Congress had expressly required states to recover all AFDC over-payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.773" offset="829015">The Eighth Circuit essentially read the Secretary's information regulation as modifying the statutory eligibility requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.712" offset="864855">And also the statutory recoupment requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.099" offset="886380">The Secretary doesn't interpret his own regulation in that way and the regulation couldn't be interpreted to modify the statutory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.990" offset="925982">That would be beyond the Secretary's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.457" offset="935804">The specific eligibility requirement involved in this case is the 1981 lump-sum statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.596" offset="964329">As the Court will recall from the Lukhard case, which was decided last term, the lump-sum statute provides that when an AFDC family receives an amount of non-recurring income greater than its monthly AFDC grant, the family will be ineligible for AFDC for one or more months, depending on the size of the lump-sum payment and the amount of the monthly grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.978" offset="1061923">Immediately after the passage of the lump-sum statute, which was part of the Omnibus Budge Reconciliation Act of 1981, Minnesota distributed a letter to all persons who were receiving AFDC in Minnesota at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.571" offset="1124303">The letter told them about certain of the OBRA changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.042" offset="1142171">Now, there were many, many OBRA changes to the AFDC program and Minnesota's letter picked out 19 of the changes that Minnesota thought were the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.933" offset="1185743">One of those was the lump-sum statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.716" offset="1192848">Minnesota sent that letter simply to assist its AFDC recipients and Minnesota had never had the understanding under the federal regulation that it was required to provide advance publicity to recipients that Congress had changed eligibility requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.244" offset="1266932">Apart from the 1981 letter, Minnesota's general program of providing information to applicants and recipients is accomplished primarily in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.487" offset="1315937">First, Minnesota provides a pamphlet for AFDC applicants which provides general information about eligibility requirements and other aspects of the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.426" offset="1359719">The pamphlet includes descriptions of those eligibility requirements which apply to every AFDC applicant and recipient and which form the framework of the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.750" offset="1408933">The pamphlet provides specific information regarding the eligibility requirements which relate to age of children, statutory reason for deprivation of parental support, the two different kinds of income limits, the resource limits of the program, the requirements to participate in work programs and in recovery of child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.866" offset="1501407">And the pamphlet tells applicants that it does not cover all the AFDC rules, that those rules change and that applicants should consult with their caseworkers concerning the more specific requirements of the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.893" offset="1569534">Second, in addition to this pamphlet, Minnesota provides a caseworker to each applicant and recipient to consult with that person concerning the specifics of the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.153" offset="1626586">Now, in addition to those information sources, every applicant and recipient knows, based on their participation in the program, on their completion of the application forms and other periodic forms on which they have to report in minute detail their income and resources and family living situations, applicants and recipients know that almost any change in their financial situation affects their AFDC eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.737" offset="1736927">As a general matter, the Secretary and the state have determined, based on their experience in operating the AFDC program, that a lengthy written explanation of eligibility requirements is less helpful to applicants or recipients than an individualized oral discussion at a time when the eligibility requirement is meaningful to the recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.770" offset="1833057">In 1984, two and a half years after the OBRA changes became effective, the named Plaintiff, Kathryn Jenkins, intervened in a pending Federal Court lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.478" offset="1879869">And Jenkins claimed that Minnesota was required to give specific, detailed, periodic, written notice to every applicant and recipient concerning only one requirement of the AFDC program, the lump-sum statute; a statute which affects really a small percentage of the recipients in the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.991" offset="1969939">The lower courts agreed with Jenkins' argument and they ordered the state to provide that kind of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.978" offset="1993867">And the court held that Minnesota's 1981 letter which included an explanation of the lump sum statute, and which Jenkins had received, hadn't been specific enough in describing the lump-sum statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.792" offset="2073175">The lower court, we believe, seriously misconstrued the Secretary's regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.279" offset="2099088">What does the regulation require?</text>
            <text syncTime="492.248" offset="2106925">This is not a regulation that requires detailed notice of every eligibility requirement or even of any specific eligibility requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.854" offset="2145377">The regulation says that applicants shall be given information in writing and orally as appropriate about various aspects of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.810" offset="2185188">In addition to eligibility requirements, the state has to describe program coverage, scope of the program, other services available, appeal rights, and other rights and responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.701" offset="2236806">And the regulation requires that the state provide simple pamphlets or bulletins containing information about the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.105" offset="2266377">The state and the Secretary agree with Judge Fagg's interpretation of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.643" offset="2300545">Judge Fagg who dissented in the Court of Appeals, said that the regulations simply requires the state to publicize generally in written form and orally as appropriate the AFDC program and its availability.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.320" offset="2355297">The 8th Circuit tried to turn the regulation into something completely different from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.291" offset="2379121">The lower court held that the regulation requires notice of a specific eligibility requirement that the lower court felt was a particularly important requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.397" offset="2415588">The court held that the regulation requires that information be provided to applicants despite the fact that the regulation only... excuse me... to recipients despite the fact that the regulation talks only of applicants and it required that the notice be given periodically.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.541" offset="2484133">The Court held that the notice must include a detailed description of the mechanics of an eligibility rule, including examples of the rules operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.047" offset="2522168">None of those requirements is based on any standard contained in the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.201" offset="2542752">The Court simply constructed those requirements on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.486" offset="2559888">Under the 8th Circuit's decision, a state can never know, until after the fact, whether it is given enough information or whether it has effectively implemented a provision of the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.162" offset="2614641">The 8th Circuit singled out this one eligibility requirement for this type of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.566" offset="2636271">The lower Court's decision can be read to require that kind of notice about every eligibility requirement, although it is not completely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.255" offset="2675036">That would be virtually impossible to do and even if it could be done, it would be virtually useless to applicants or recipients to overwhelm them with that volume of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.945" offset="2713802">The Plaintiffs argue that while the lower Court didn't require this type of notice concerning every eligibility requirement, but that the lower Court's decision is not necessarily limited to the lump-sum statute either.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.086" offset="2766360">That there may be other eligibility requirements, as yet unidentified, about which the state has to give that kind of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.108" offset="2798439">But when you look at what happened in this case, it is easy to understand why those kinds of gray areas make the situation so administratively unworkable for Minnesota and the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.666" offset="2852669">In 1981, there was nothing in the regulation or in any interpretation of the Secretary which would have informed Minnesota that it was even required by law to distribute the informational letter or that it was required to single out one provision of the AFDC program, the lump-sum statute, for specialized treatment in that letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.032" offset="2946083">And in its AFDC pamphlet, Minnesota had no way of knowing, based on the language of the Federal Regulation or any interpretation of the Secretary, that even though not every eligibility requirement had to be described, the lump-sum statute did have to be described and in great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.861" offset="3025391">Under the 8th Circuit's decision, a state has to guess about what information is required, and about which eligibility requirements have to be described.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.717" offset="3064888">And if a state predicts wrong, if a Federal Court later disagrees with the state's considered judgment, based on its experience, then the state's implementation of the eligibility requirement is set aside for the past months, or even years, as occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.178" offset="3134687">Even if the 8th Circuit was correct in its holding that Minnesota was required to provide more information, the Court's remedy here was certainly improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.503" offset="3184006">Because Kathryn Jenkins had appealed the termination of her benefits, she received continued benefits during that appeal process and when the appeal was resolved, the county agency notified Jenkins that it would recoup the overpayment that had been made to her by withholding one percent of her monthly AFDC grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.019" offset="3274076">The 8th Circuit enjoined Minnesota from recouping the overpayment made to Jenkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.839" offset="3301348">The Court said that since Minnesota had not provided enough information concerning this lump-sum statute, the state had not effectively implemented the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.295" offset="3339173">And that Jenkins was not subject to the statute, subject to the eligibility condition established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.384" offset="3363520">The lower Court ordered that Jenkins was entitled to receive and to retain AFDC benefits, even though Congress had expressly said otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.823" offset="3405315">In the lump-sum statute, of course, Congress had said that when an AFDC recipient received a certain amount of income, the recipient would be ineligible for a fixed period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.880" offset="3453485">And Congress did not provide that if the state did not provide advance information concerning the requirement, that it did not become effective and that people weren't subject to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.105" offset="3494341">And in another of the 1981 OBRA changes, Congress said that if any recipient received more benefits than he or she was entitled to receive, the state was required to recoup that overpayment of benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="972.137" offset="4026507">The Secretary agrees in this case, though, that his information regulation that we have been talking about doesn't provide that if information isn't given, the eligibility conditions won't be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.332" offset="4095262">This Court has recognized in a number of cases that courts can't order the benefits be paid out contrary to the conditions set by Congress for the receipt of those benefits, to remedy mistakes made by government agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.425" offset="4151686">Even where government agents have provided mis-information, as in FCIC v. Merrill or Schweiker v. Hansen, this Court nonetheless, has said that Congress has established the conditions upon which those monies can be paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.602" offset="4208424">An administrative mistake simply doesn't create an entitlement to benefits where a person doesn't meet Congress' eligibility requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.338" offset="4243324">That doesn't mean that a Court is without any authority to remedy a state's failure to comply with an information regulation if that kind of obligation exists here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.871" offset="4441436">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.566" offset="4508205">Congress has not imposed any notification requirements on the Secretaries or on the states, in order to implement the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.921" offset="4545613">The Secretary has therefore been required to determine what types of notice the state should be required to give and whether the notices should be uniform throughout the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.711" offset="4584796">In undertaking that responsibility, the Secretary's scheme has three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.865" offset="4605381">First, applicants, that is a person defined by the regulations who has submitted an application and whose application has not been terminated, must be given information about the basic outlines of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.608" offset="4664417">Second, a recipient must be told to inform his or her caseworker about changes in circumstances, so that the caseworker can counsel that person about the effect, if any, those changes in circumstances may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.082" offset="4710288">Third, applicants and recipients must be given written information explaining why an application was rejected or benefits have been terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.288" offset="4751144">The Secretary's scheme leaves considerable discretion to the states, because the circumstances under which the different AFDC programs are implemented, as well as the factors that are relevant to each person will vary from state-to-state and from person-to-person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.733" offset="4812897">There is no reason to believe that the situation under which the AFDC program is implemented, in Minnesota is the same as what it is implemented like in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.939" offset="4853753">There are a variety of different factors that can vary from place-to-place or from person-to-person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.159" offset="4874651">The amount of income or resources that individuals may have, whether individuals are receiving income or resources from some other type of social service program, the number of caseworkers in a community, the caseload those people may have, the ability of a client to reach a caseworker's office to discuss matters with him personally, and the ability of people in a particular locality to understand written or spoken english.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.477" offset="4975902">Because these matters can vary greatly from state-to-state, the Federal Government las left the states considerable latitude in deciding how best to implement the information requirements of the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.368" offset="5023444">The states, in turn, have to make two judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.336" offset="5043297">First, advance written notice to beneficiaries, may not be the most effective way of providing information about the operation of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.758" offset="5072973">And face-to-face counseling, counseling over the telephone, or other types of circumstances like that may be far more appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.198" offset="5106723">Some states may decide that the best way to to communicate information to someone is after a person has been accepted into the program, to have that person come in for counseling and at that time, have that person told about a variety of different general obligations and also be told that they should report changes in circumstances to a caseworker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.743" offset="5180911">In other circumstances, a state may decide that written information is better.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.813" offset="5201182">And different people can differ as to what is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.681" offset="5212675">Here, for example, the affidavits submitted by the caseworkers and other personnel who administer the AFDC program in Minnesota, which affidavits are reprinted in the Joint Appendix, indicate that the affiants believed in their experience, the best way to communicate the effect of the program to a person was to tell a person before or after, for example, a lump-sum had been received, about how that may or may not affect his circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.064" offset="5314240">Not every one of the different rules, including the lump-sum rule, will affect every person who participates in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.153" offset="5342556">The lump-sum rule is, itself, a contingency certain events have to occur before it affects anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.455" offset="5363768">In addition, there is evidence in the record, submitted in one of the affidavits by Petitioner's state officials that at least in one county, that is described as being average in size, somewhere between only one and five percent of the people in the program are affected by the lump-sum rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.381" offset="5423536">It may also be that not everyone who receives a lump-sum will necessarily have their income reduced as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.487" offset="5451957">There may be other circumstances that occurred during the same period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.106" offset="5466377">For example, there may be the unfortunate circumstance that medical expenses might need to be incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.760" offset="5489051">The result is, that whether or not a person receives a lump sum, can itself not necessarily affect the eligibility or continued eligibility determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.431" offset="5527712">In addition, states are entitled to take into account the fact that advance written notice might be costly and every dollar spent on the implementation of the program is a dollar that can't be paid out to beneficiaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.371" offset="6483480">After all, the material should be simple and understandable, because the ability of people to contact their caseworkers may differ.</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.083" offset="6550354">The Secretary has felt that it believes that it is not prudent to require that all different types of written material be provided to everyone in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.855" offset="6585358">The regulation, itself, subsection I, on which the Court of Appeals relied only applies to applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.593" offset="6608346">And even in that respect, we don't believe that applicants should be flooded with a variety of materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.795" offset="6629139">The Secretary's regulation, we believe, is designed to, or the whole scheme is designed to afford people notice about how this system works, to help them understand what happens when they receive new income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.535" offset="6676160">Giving them a variety of notice in written form may be damaging, because they may not understand how it works.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.420" offset="6775634">The question before this Court is whether the District Court and the Court of Appeals properly applied a Federal Regulation which requires that certain information be provided in written form.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.118" offset="6878452">Now, the Minnesota Welfare Department does provide certain information in written form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.272" offset="6903111">These are the two pamphlets that are in the Joint Appendix, which are given by the Welfare Department to everyone who applies for AFDC.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.555" offset="6988166">But for some unknown reason, the Commissioner chose not to say a word about the lump-sum rule, in any written information given to anyone who applied for AFDC between October of 1981, when the lump-sum statute went into effect and July of 1985, when the Commissioner complied with the District Court's order requiring that an explanation of the lump-sum rule be provided.</text>
