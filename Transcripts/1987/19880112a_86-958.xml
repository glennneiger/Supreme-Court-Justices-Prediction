            <label>Mr. Gordon B. Conn, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="80.368" offset="454935">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="82.951" offset="465279">This is a bankruptcy case on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.490" offset="495477">The case involves the so-called 11 reorganization proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.580" offset="527764">The issue on which this Court has granted review, slightly paraphrased, is whether a Chapter 11 debtor, in this case a farmer, may cram down a plan of reorganization over the objections of unpaid creditors, where the creditors will not be paid out under the plan, but where the debtor will retain all his property in exchange for a promise in the future to contribute his labor, experience and expertise in the business operation of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.753" offset="672482">The Court of Appeals, by a divided panel decision, held in favor of the debtor on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.157" offset="698082">In doing so, the Court of Appeals reversed the factual findings of both the Bankruptcy Court and the District Court, regarding the lack of adequate protection for the secured creditors' interest in the property, and also regarding the feasibility of reorganization of this particular debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.236" offset="778435">The panel decision held that a Chapter 11 reorganization of this debtor in this case would be feasible, notwithstanding the opposite finding by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.913" offset="837158">In this case, the Court of Appeals held that reorganization would be feasible because number one, the debtor in this case would have no present obligation to provide adequate protection of his secured creditors' interests in collateral, thereby freeing up funds for reorganization that would otherwise need to be used to pay adequate protection, and number two, that reorganization would be feasible because the debtor could overcome what is known as the 11 U.S.C. Section 1129 (B), previously reflected in this Court's decisions in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber, and others, that the "absolute priority" rule could be overcome by the debtor's promising in the plan to devote his future labor, experience and expertise to the reorganized operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.012" offset="1033495">The essence of it is that, notwithstanding the statute, and the prior decisions of this Court, a bankruptcy debtor under this decision may retain property by a future promise of working without paying his creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.688" offset="1100264">The case arises out of the following general facts: The Petitioners are creditors of the debtor who in this case is a farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.245" offset="1142477">The Petitioners include the Federal Land Bank of St. Paul and Norwest Bank of Worthington.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.964" offset="1161286">The Land Bank's interest began in about 1965 when it made various real estate loans to Mr. Ahlers, and the interests of Norwest Bank Worthington arose in about 1982 when that bank extended various operating loans, all secured by second mortgages on real estate, and by security interests in other collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.961" offset="1245295">The debtors' borrowings from these two institutions amounted to in the neighborhood of $1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.051" offset="1269642">By late 1984, the debtors' were in serious default under their loans and filed for protection, under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.072" offset="1305795">Shortly following that filing the Land Bank and Norwest promptly moved for relief from the bankruptcy automatic stay under Section 362(D) of the Bankruptcy Code to permit foreclose of their mortgages and security interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.784" offset="1376639">At this time, I think it is common knowledge, the farm economy, particularly in the Midwest, was in a troubled state and secured creditors in particular were seeing the values of their collateral diminish.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.710" offset="1440273">Land values in particular had declined sharply and were continuing on the downside.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.447" offset="1459291">Indications, Justice White, are that the corner may have been turned, I believe.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="344.089" offset="1509864">I'm glad to know that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gordon_b_conn_jr" startTime="344.605" stopTime="587.913">
            <label>Mr. Gordon B. Conn, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="344.605" offset="1511849">There may be some dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.791" offset="1520626">In seeking relief from the stay to permit foreclosure, the two creditors here moved both to lift the stay for lack of adequate protection of their interests in the collateral under Section 362 (d)(1), and also moved for relief from stay under Section 362 (d)(2), which provides for relief from stay where the debtor has no equity in the property, and the property in question is not necessary for an effective reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.862" offset="1656881">In moving under this latter section, the Petitioners took the position that the property was not necessary for an effective reorganization, because the debtors' financial condition was so desperate that no reorganization could in any instance be feasible in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.038" offset="1717589">The Bankruptcy Court granted relief from the stay, holding that adequate protection was required to protect Petitioners' interest in the property and that the debtors' officers of adequate protection were not sufficient to provide that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.066" offset="1777775">Accordingly, the Bankruptcy Court ordered that the automatic stay be lifted to permit the creditors to foreclose their interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.970" offset="1805361">The District Court affirmed and the debtor then sought relief in the Court of Appeals to stay the effect of the orders of the lower Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.826" offset="1836812">The Court of Appeals did stay the orders, pending appeal, and also directed, in connection with one of those interim orders, that the District Court undertake a specific examination of the feasibility of reorganization for these debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.884" offset="1889057">The District Court did so, and in an Opinion included in our Appendix, the District Court undertook an analysis of the debtors' financial operations and projections from the Bankruptcy Court file and concluded that the debtors' situation was so dire that there was utter unfeasibility of reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.464" offset="1975366">The matter then went back to the Eighth Circuit, and on that further appeal, in a divided panel decision, the Court of Appeals reversed the lower Court's holding that no adequate protection was required as to the real estate because of a timing issue that would hold under the applicable state law that no protection would be required for a year and six weeks, thereby freeing up substantial funds for use by the debtor while retaining the property, and number two, and this is the issue involved in this proceeding, that reorganization of this debtor would be feasible, despite the findings of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.672" offset="2128130">The basis on which the panel decision found that reorganization would be feasible, which I will address in more detail in a moment, was that the debtor, despite not being able to pay creditors in a plan of reorganization, should nonetheless be allowed to retain all the property under a plan in exchange for the debtors' willingness to provide work over the years of the plan, which might or might not result in some additional payment to creditors that would not be received in a liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.910" offset="2261145">Following that decision, the Petitioners moved for rehearing with a suggestion for rehearing en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.582" offset="2287790">The decision of the Court of Appeals was a five to four vote in favor of rehearing, but rehearing was nonetheless denied because of lack of an absolute majority of the Judges on the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.074" offset="2337736">The tenth Judge had recused himself from participation because of prior representation of the Land Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.394" offset="2367098">Petitioners then sought relief in this Court through the Petition for Certiorari, on three grounds: number one, the lack of adequate protection; two, the en banc question; and three, the absolute priority issue, which his sometimes described as the sweat equity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.422" offset="2431150">The certiorari was granted as to the absolute priority issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.790" offset="2448600">We believe in this proceeding that the decision of the Court of Appeals on that issue is in error and should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.848" offset="2612858">The amount of unsecured creditors who were not in this dual position, as are the two banks, was very, very small.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.037" offset="2649638">I believe the total indebtedness reflected there was something like $70,000 as compared to $500,000 in the unsecured portion of the Petitioners.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gordon B. Conn, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="644.729" offset="2712437">We believe that the decision of the Eighth Circuit Panel is error, basically for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.585" offset="2751829">First, allowing the retention of property by a debtor without satisfying objecting creditors in full is contrary to the plain language of the relevant portion of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.893" offset="2797073">The relevant portion is 11 U.S.C. Section 1129 (b)(2)(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="671.214" offset="2818285">Second, to the extent that the prior decisions of this Court on the absolute priority issue survive enactment of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, the decision of the Court of Appeals is clearly contrary to the rule of law announced in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber, the Boyd case, and several others previously announced by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.479" offset="2911385">Finally, and from a broader perspective, we believe that the decision of the Court of Appeals seriously upsets the balance of rights and remedies and bargaining mix, if you will, that Congress established in enacting the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, and in doing so, unfairly expands the so-called cram down power of debtors to the severe detriment of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.297" offset="3014621">On the first point, which I think is the clearest, that is, the language of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="740.675" offset="3096123">Your Honor, I have difficulty with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.781" offset="3120574">There is a substantial attraction to the bright line test that is suggested in the Solicitor General's brief that would avoid any difficulty of valuing new contributions by former owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.272" offset="3178566">In reviewing the legislative history of the absolute priority provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, I am frankly not on certain whether Congress intended totally to abrogate the prior rule of Los Angeles Lumber.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.633" offset="3243976">I would have to say that there does not appear at least to me to be a specific intent to overrule prior case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.620" offset="3271980">However, what does appear to me, in reviewing that legislative history, is that there was clearly no intention on the part of Congress to in any way expand whatever exception there might have been to absolute priority under those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.314" offset="3326732">I think the contrary is true, and that can be seen by the fact that in defining the term "fair and equitable" out of which the absolute priority rule had evolved in judicial decisions, Congress chose expressly to define "fair and equitable" to exclude the retention of property without full payment of senior creditors.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.435" offset="3451180">Not on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.618" offset="3455986">In fact, the key point on that, Your Honor, is that when the Tulsa revision of the bankruptcy laws was proposed by the Bankruptcy Commission, there was recognition that there were some special difficulties for individual debtors and there was recognition that maybe the rule of Los Angeles Lumber of this Court was too harsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.300" offset="3550654">The Commission suggested that the laws be amended to relax the absolute priority rule in general to allow equity participation by former owners, and in particular to allow participation by individuals, after a period of time in a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.512" offset="3623483">Congress, by enacting the 1978 Code, expressly did not follow those recommendations of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.499" offset="3655457">Instead, what Congress did was to enact the specific provisions in 1129(b)(2)(B) which expressly state that a debtor cannot retain property under a plan over the objection of his creditors without satisfying those prior claims in full under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.310" offset="3722748">The absolute priority rule, which is codified now in the statute, has something of a harsh ring to it, and indeed, the very language of it is by its terms, absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.826" offset="3812819">In commenting on that, I would like to observe that in what I perceive at least to be the real world of bankruptcy, it does not work that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.615" offset="3855973">Under the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, in order to confirm a plan of reorganization, a debtor need not invariably satisfy that absolute priority rule, which was the case under the earlier case law of Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Company, where that rule had to be satisfied notwithstanding the fact that creditors favored allowing participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.249" offset="3954507">Under the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, all a debtor needs to do to overcome the absolute priority rule, is to convince his creditors that they will fare better in a reorganization in which the debtor retains an interest than they would in a liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.109" offset="4021903">This is part of the mix of bargaining rights that I believe was established by Congress under the Code and it is only in a rare situation where a debtor is either unable or unwilling to make a satisfactory offer to his creditors that the issue of cram down comes into play or that the veto power of the absolute priority rule if you will, comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.592" offset="4127855">In the briefs submitted by the Respondents and their amicus curiae supporters, there seems to be an argument made that the absolute priority provisions of the Bankruptcy Code somehow should make a distinction between individual debtors and corporate debtors, such that, while it is appropriate to apply the absolute priority rule to prevent shareholders of a corporation from retaining equity interest, it is somehow not appropriate to apply that rule where the debtor is an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.230" offset="4258363">I think the response to that argument is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.800" offset="4280724">First, the plain language of the absolute priority rule in the statute does not admit of any distinction between individual and corporate debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.673" offset="4320117">Throughout the Bankruptcy Code, it is clear that when Congress chosen to deal with particular needs of particular classes of debtors, it has done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.547" offset="4367660">For example, only individuals can exempt certain property from the estate under Section 522.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.451" offset="4391274">Only individuals can avoid liens on exempt property under that same section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.355" offset="4410918">Only individuals are entitled to a complete discharge of debt under Section 727.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.342" offset="4438817">Only farmers are immune from involuntary bankruptcy cases under Section 03.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.961" offset="4457312">In addition, Congress has made special provisions for individuals and farmers in Chapters 12 and 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.067" offset="4481762">I think the implication is fairly clear, that had Congress chosen to do so, in the absolute priority rule, it could have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.304" offset="4510706">Indeed, that was specifically suggested by the Bankruptcy Commission, and was not enacted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.493" offset="4543411">The decision below looks around, I think, the clear language of the statute and seeks to rely on this Court's decision in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber for support for the notion that a debtor may in effect buy into a reorganization thorough a promise of future work or service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.977" offset="4649364">With all respect, I think that the ruling in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber is to the contrary and does not support the position of the panel decision in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.884" offset="4700982">In fact, the Los Angeles Lumber case reversed decisions of the lower Courts which allowed equity owners' retention of equity interests in a bankruptcy where the consideration, if you will, for that retention was their future management standing in the community and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.465" offset="4787291">That is very close, I think, to what the Court of Appeals has done below in this case, and Case v. Los Angeles Lumber simply doesn't support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.221" offset="4822399">What the Court of Appeals did and what the Respondents and their amicus supporters strive to do here, is to fit this sweat equity notion within the apparent exception of Case v. Los Angeles Lumber that would have allowed existing shareholders to participate in a reorganization in exchange for an infusion of new capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.436" offset="4915186">The argument goes that because the debtor in this case will agree to provide services in the future, that is the equivalent of new capital for the operation and therefore it is not a violation of the absolute priority rule to allow the debtor to retain all interest in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.333" offset="4990837">There are several problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.202" offset="5002331">First, it would apply in virtually any Chapter 11 case involving an individual debtor because obviously it is implicit in any individual reorganization that the individual intends to keep working the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.426" offset="5055202">The next argument that is made by the Respondents is that the debtor really would not be retaining anything here, because what is being retained is of no value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.000" offset="5097521">The debtor has no equity in the property, therefore it is valueless, therefore it is not a retention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.202" offset="5118314">The problem with that analysis is that obviously, there is some going concern value here, or the parties would not have been litigating over it for the last three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.994" offset="5165439">This "no value" theory is, as I read the Attorney General's amicus brief, not endorsed by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.398" offset="5195114">It is rejected by Professor Nimmer's article on which they rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.468" offset="5215385">And with the exception of the Star City Rebuilders case, I believe that "no value" argument has been rejected by every lower court to consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.907" offset="5249135">The next argument they make is that by agreeing to provide future services, the debtor is injecting new value to the organization which would enable, in effect, the purchase the property over the objection of the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.750" offset="5308486">The problem with that argument is that the promise to provide future services is really nothing new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.904" offset="5341086">It is implicit in the original loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.206" offset="5354252">Any time I take out a loan for my business, implicit in my promise to repay is that I am going to work in the business to generate funds to repay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.812" offset="5388734">What is happening in this situation is that the debtor is seeking to have the level of debt structured down in bankruptcy and then saying okay, now I am going to promise to repay this lower debt by working the business, which is precisely what the original promise implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.673" offset="5456130">In that context, there is nothing new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.125" offset="5465952">Secondly, on that same point, the notion that the debtor's services are providing consideration for buying the assets in substantial part involves bootstrapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.754" offset="5532512">The return on use of this property is going to come from the debtor's use of the land, equipment, other cash collateral which is subject to the creditor's claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.276" offset="5574621">Only a portion of whatever funds could be generated are solely attributable to the debtor's own services, and therefore, again it is not new value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.083" offset="5621851">Finally, the exception, if that is what it is, in Angeles Lumber, speaking about allowing equity holders to buy in through a capital infusion, is clearly that the capital infusion must be in money or money's worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.497" offset="5707428">Now, the difficulty with the lower Court's decision in Ahlers is that an unenforceable promise to provide future services is not a current asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.173" offset="5762180">As in Los Angeles Lumber, it is not an item that can be put on the balance sheet of the business organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.844" offset="5784855">It has no present value for liquidation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.112" offset="5797916">In short, it does not enhance the estate for creditors at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.581" offset="5811813">If the plan fails, the promise of the debtor to work in the future does not give the creditors unpaid any further rights than they would have had before, and therefore, it is, I believe, a totally illusory obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.110" offset="5873880">Finally, and I think in the broader context here, the difficulty with what Ahlers does in the overall context of the Bankruptcy Code is that it severely upsets the relative bargaining positions between the debtor on the one hand and the creditors on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.606" offset="5959875">It gives a very strong tool to debtors in virtually ever case involving an individual reorganization, which is a far departure from what at least I believe Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.966" offset="6025286">The real upshot of Ahlers is that, contrary to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, which contemplated that a secured creditor should be able, if criteria were met, to obtain a decision on a lift stay motion within 30 days after making that motion, and if the stay were not lifted that the creditor would receive protection of its interest during the duration of the bankruptcy case that has been turned upside down by the Ahlers decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.254" offset="6150464">What has been seen in this case is that the Petitioners, who started out as secured creditors and now hold dual roles, have been precluded for three years from enforcing their rights in collateral, which has probably been declining during the interim, and they are now confronted, if the Ahlers were upheld, with seeing their debts restructured at decision lower level and proceeding over a longer period with continuing risk to ride with the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.773" offset="6276584">Now, on policy arguments, one can argue that that might be an appropriate approach to attempting to assist the troubled farm economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.747" offset="6316499">The response to that is, that is precisely what Congress has done, or attempted to do, in enacting Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.353" offset="6358922">The responses to these problems as perceived are invariably legislative responses rather than calling for changing dramatically the provisions of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.196" offset="6414301">I think that Congress, through Chapter 12, and the various state legislatures through their Farm Mediation Acts and the like, have demonstrated an ability to address that problem, and I believe that the effort of the Court of Appeals to do it by judicial means is inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.908" offset="6481070">I would like to reserve the balance of my time, if I may.</text>

            <text syncTime="2187.894" offset="8885067">And in providing this labor and in going forward with the Chapter 11 and the confirmed plan, we are going to promise to pay unsecured creditors 100 cents on the dollar.</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.269" offset="10586579">1129 came out of Chapter 10, which was a corporate reorganization.</text>

            <text syncTime="2627.696" offset="10644257">And we say it is in there, as Boyd says, it is to protect the large corporation creditors from collusion between large corporation itself and the secured creditors to the exclusion of the unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.205" offset="10702249">What we are saying here is the same equitable rule should apply to protect the other unsecured creditors from the unscrupulous activities of the large, secured creditors who are willing for whatever reason, to get their collateral back, to get the farm back, to the detriment of all the unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.619" offset="10787931">They are voting their unsecured claim in an inequitable way to the damage of all other creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.706" offset="10812277">If the Equity Court of the United States and the Bankruptcy Court and the Supreme Court protected the unsecured creditors against the bondholders and the debtor's activity in Boyd, then why shouldn't the Bankruptcy Court and this Court protect all the other unsecured creditors in this case against the unscrupulous activities of the Federal instrumentality that is seeking to subvert the efforts of the farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.090" offset="10917811">What the farmer is retaining here, has no present value.</text>

            <text syncTime="2709.350" offset="10970892">Judge Heaney has given it value, and hopefully, over time, Ahlers will pay back his creditors 100 cents on the dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.437" offset="11003180">Why the creditors and the banks do not stand behind us in the Ahlers case, I will never understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.824" offset="11024809">If the banks and the Federal instrumentality here had thousands of Ahlers out there, every day, paying off these loans, every day making a profit, we would not have the financial crisis that we have today, because these loans would have value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.684" offset="11080188">You would not need a bailout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.452" offset="11091264">Now, at the present time... I checked with Mr. Ahlers last night... he has $300,000 in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.023" offset="11113521">So under this Ahlers case, he has been doing fairly well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.992" offset="11133478">I would point out to Your Honors, under 1129, and throughout the Code, the Congress has put in the words "includes" and "including".</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.436" offset="11195232">In 1129, when we talk about the provision that has been called the absolute priority rule and the fair and equitable, I would point out to Your Honor that the terms "include", "including", are put in there, which to me, and I think to other people in this business, mean that there are other interpretations of this hard and fast rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.898" offset="11269106">If the hard and fast rule were allowed to apply, the Ahlers could not reorganize, because they could not pay off their creditors 100 cents on the dollar.</text>

            <text syncTime="2968.600" offset="12007849">And we believe that the history of the Chapter proceedings of old Chapter 10, of old Chapter 11 and old Chapter 11 and 12 will show that what came into the Code was the absolute priority rule in 10, and that is in here for shareholders and large corporations to prevent the overreaching in Boyd, and is further recognized by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.175" offset="12554122">The statute was promulgated originally because we prefer reorganization over liquidation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.751" offset="12620473">The liquidations proposed here by the Land Banks across the country are going to promote crises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.505" offset="12643460">One of the reasons that we read in the paper, in my opinion, that the situation has stabilized, is that because since the Ahlers case, there have been reorganizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.896" offset="12693093">In the Minnesota District, the score is not zero any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.116" offset="12709916">There are cases that have been reorganized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.282" offset="12718588">There are numerous farmers who have reorganized in the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.418" offset="12731127">As Judge O'Brien himself said, after this decision came down, I have been instructed now by the Circuit to help farmers and not usher them down the tube.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.709" offset="12772296">I am not going to initially grant motions to dismiss as I did before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.328" offset="12790791">And the next case after Ahlers was confirmed within a very, very short time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.664" offset="12808136">I suggest to you that the bargaining rights that have been protected here, that Ahlers has swung the pendulum back to the center, and now that there is bargaining... there was no bargaining before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.205" offset="12854321">There was liquidation, liquidation and no confirmation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.155" offset="13170089">They have been lending strictly on asset value and they were not looking at income value, and they admit that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.455" offset="13587317">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.174" offset="13598184">I agree with Mr. Needler that the Ahlers decision has sweeping ramifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.526" offset="13619604">It has had substantial ramifications in the Eighth Circuit, and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.763" offset="13644473">Among the problems with the lower Court's decision in Ahlers is that it is not limited or limitable to the perceived problems with agriculture, but rather, it is equally applicable in any Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.391" offset="13707062">It has substantially altered, as Judge Gibson said in dissent, substantially altered the relationship between debtor and creditor and it is far beyond anything that Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.199" offset="13754291">With respect to the voting question raised by Mr. Needler, that the creditors should somehow be estopped from voting against whatever plan is proposed, the answer to that is that the Bankruptcy Code specifically provides that a secured creditor who becomes undersecured is treated as an unsecured creditor for the balance of its claim and is entitled to the same voting rights as any other unsecured creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.599" offset="13863901">And if those creditors control the group of unsecured creditors, in amount and number, they have the absolute right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.269" offset="13894517">The absolute priority rule is by its terms, absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.407" offset="13915101">That has been the law for close to 100 years and was not changed by Congress in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.144" offset="13946030">If anything, it was strengthened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.928" offset="13953135">The tradeoff, however, is that the rule, although absolute, can now under the new law be waived by creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.468" offset="13987304">Therefore, all that is incumbent on a debtor is to convince his creditors that they will fare better under a plan of reorganization that leaves property in the hands and management of the debtor than they would under a liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.926" offset="14033175">If in a case where a liquidation would produce zero for the unsecured creditors, if the debtor can convince those creditors that they will get something by voting in favor of a plan.</text>
