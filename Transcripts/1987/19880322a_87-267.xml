            <text syncTime="615.237" offset="2586217">Holmes ordered its catalogues in this manner because it participated in what is called the Atkins Buying Organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.532" offset="2611399">In its participation with this organization in New York it obtained the design, construction, printing, and distribution of catalogues at discount rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.806" offset="2672421">It simply relied on its participation in this purchasing organization in New York to handle all of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.741" offset="2696140">If in fact the purchase organization had found that the best arrangement could have been made with Louisiana printers, it perhaps would have contracted with Louisiana printers for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.613" offset="2731666">In fact, the organization didn't find that.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.691" offset="2740026">Holmes did not adopt this method of distributing catalogues in order to avoid Louisiana taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.423" offset="2762909">We are focusing here on the obligation of a state to collect a use tax versus the obligation for it to have a use tax imposed upon its use of goods in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.479" offset="2815154">As I mentioned in the National Geographic case, this Court specifically pointed out the distinction between imposing the obligation on Holmes to collect a use tax, which we would not dispute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.100" offset="2857577">If in fact this were a situation where the taxing state was trying to get Holmes to collect taxes on the value of the catalogues in the hands of a recipient, there would be no problem, and the state could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.110" offset="2913688">The state could impose the obligation on us.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.532" offset="2923301">Because we have... because Holmes has due process contacts with Louisiana, the state could require us to collect the tax from the recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.965" offset="2957051">However, this Court made it very clear in its decision in National Geographic by stating that however fatal to a direct tax, and that is the tax we are talking about here, direct tax, direct use tax on Holmes on the value of these catalogues, might be, that particular legal argument does not apply in the case of imposing the obligation on the taxpayer to collect a use tax on someone else in the taxing state who actually used the goods which are sought to be taxed.</text>

            <text syncTime="748.557" offset="3119428">All of the manufacture and construction of the catalogues, the addressing, the mailing took place out of Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.101" offset="9633635">In determining the operational incidence of the statute, you are correct, the state court does determine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.364" offset="9654638">This court, however, has the prerogative of determining whether or not the incidence upon which the state court imposes the tax does violate the commerce clause, and we are saying that this... the importing aspect of distribution is not one of the activities which the state has the power to tax under the commerce clause because in that instance there is no activity within the State of Louisiana by Holmes which can be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.214" offset="9754112">Remember, the key word is activity by Holmes with respect to those clocks within the State of Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.653" offset="9895800">If they send out from Washington, D.C., or from the national or international headquarters notices soliciting funds for particular purposes, the Red Cross is using property within the State of Louisiana, and to the extent it is using property under the state's theory, the value of those pieces of paper in a state are then subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.692" offset="9975944">This tax would also impact universities trying to solicit particular funds for their operations.</text>
