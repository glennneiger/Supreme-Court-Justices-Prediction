            <text syncTime="63.148" offset="387805">This case involves the interpretation of two provisions of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, the EHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.721" offset="434094">The first issue concerns the so-called "stay-put provision".</text>
            <text syncTime="83.452" offset="468993">That Section states,</text>
            <text syncTime="86.607" offset="481637">"During the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this Section, unless the state or local educational agency and the parents or guardian otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then-current educational placement of such child.

            <text syncTime="117.298" offset="604412">The second issue involves a provision which, if I might paraphrase it, states that,</text>
            <text syncTime="124.669" offset="633878">"Where a local educational agency is unable or unwilling to provide services to handicapped children, the state itself must step in and provide those services directly. "</text>

            <text syncTime="145.427" offset="716948">John Doe was released from a state mental hospital in the spring of 1980 and was enrolled in the San Francisco school district and an Individualized Education Program was designed for him, an IEP&gt; ["], and he was placed in a special school.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.637" offset="797718">In October 1980, he got involved in an altercation with a child and attempted to choke a by-stander.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.538" offset="845366">No disciplinary action was taken at that time, although the principal and his aides tried to work with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.411" offset="872846">Shortly afterward, on November 6, 1980 a far more serious incident occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.113" offset="895625">He got involved this time in an argument with a child over a basketball and he jumped on this child and choked him and strangled him to the point where this other child did suffer abrasions to his neck and pain--</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.903" offset="4194786">But permit me, if you will, to precede to my second issue, which is the question of whether in an individual case, the state must provide direct services to a child?</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.803" offset="4254450">The Ninth Circuit says that,</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.943" offset="4266989">"where the local educational agency is unable or unwilling to provide services to one child, to any individual child, the state must step in and provide those services. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.484" offset="4317144">And we believe that is contrary to the language of the statute, which speaks in terms of "children residing in the area"; which talks about "programs".</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.917" offset="4358835">This is repeated in C.F.R. Section 300.360, where they talk about "children in the area served".</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.476" offset="4397078">We think that Congress meant this:</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.115" offset="4403661">Local school districts are on the front line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.131" offset="4419753">They give these services, and where you have children who can be served only in a regional center like a school for the deaf or a school for the blind, that is when the state steps in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.049" offset="4459354">Or where you have a small district that does not have a program in its district whatever for handicapped children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.139" offset="4483805">Or it is unwilling to set out a program for its district as a whole, then the state steps in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.871" offset="4510659">Otherwise you have got the complaint procedures in 1415, where the child or its representative, files the Complaint and goes through those procedures which are designed to protect him and gets the services to which he is entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.332" offset="4580562">And upon the completion of those procedures, 1 if it ever goes to a district court, the district court has a fully developed record and can make an intelligent choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.484" offset="4629150">So, we think that in both these... on both these issues, we are implementing the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.558" offset="4661437">On the first issue it is implicit that Congress could not have meant to take form school authorities the responsibility to guarantee a safe classroom and a safe environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.960" offset="4719011">And on the second issue, that the scheme is such that the state provides direct services only when a local district acts in the manner which we have indicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1166.608" offset="4801663">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.573" offset="4837503">Primarily for the reasons stated by Petitioner, the United States agrees that the court below misconstrued the "stay-put" in the direct services provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.052" offset="4875433">Even if Petitioner is wrong, we submit that the answer can only be because the courts below erred on a remedy that they issued as relief for the asserted violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.360" offset="4920677">This Court in Burlington said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.641" offset="4929767">"in devising a remedy for a violation of the EHA, a court should always keep in mind the principle overriding the objective of the EHA, which is the provision of free appropriate public education in the least-restrictive environment possible for all our nation's handicapped children. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.573" offset="4997477">The decision below deserves that congressional objective and does so in the following two senses: first, if school administrators are required to maintain the placement of a dangerous child pending administrative and judicial proceedings, the incentive in the initial IEP process will be for school administrators to resist the placement of any child who has a perceived risk of dangerousness in a mainstreamed environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.186" offset="5107922">There are under this statute many children who have a risk of dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.465" offset="5129029">The question is whether or not they will act out those tendencies of dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.400" offset="5144807">We do not know until they are in the placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.478" offset="5153062">If school administrators are told</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.790" offset="5162362">"you cannot take them out once they act on it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.819" offset="5170512">they will not put them there in the first place, and many more children will be deprived of the benefits of this statute, the principal objective of the mainstream environment than would be the case if the "stay-put" exception were not so rigidly applied as it was by the Ninth Circuit as it was in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.266" offset="5232265">A similar point can be made with respect to the direct services provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.562" offset="5245431">The child's IEP is determined on the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.920" offset="5262881">More often than not... indeed, in the principal number of cases, the least restrictive environment will be on the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.886" offset="5294750">If the local agency defaults, the appropriate remedy is to order the local education agency who did the IEP and has the direct services available, to provide them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.364" offset="5336651">The state acts in a supervisory capacity and should be held to order the local education agencies to provide those services, but the appropriate guns placed to the local educational agencies' head, not to the state agency's head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.953" offset="5395060">Let me move to each point in a little bit more detail: this Court has said on numerous occasions that equitable relief, such as injunctive relief and declaratory relief, should not issue as a matter of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.401" offset="5452843">The Court has recognized that Congress can and sometimes does, restrict a court's equitable discretion, but it had said, given the history of equity practice, that the Court will not find the Congress has restricted the equitable jurisdiction of a court unless Congress says so in explicit words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.284" offset="5520344">And we submit that there are no such explicit words to be found in the EHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.657" offset="5537793">Specifically we would refer the Court to 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(2), which is the remedial provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.560" offset="5569454">That is the section of the statute which says that</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.888" offset="5578753">"A court may order any appropriate relief. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.918" offset="5590874">This Court in Burlington said that is a broad grant of discretion to courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.447" offset="5613026">And we submit that the "stay-put" provision was not intended and does not limit, the discretion with which a court may determine what is an appropriate remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1796.589" offset="7321539">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: I will begin right to the beginning by saying in fact John Doe is 24 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.475" offset="7365111">He is in a state hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.928" offset="7370962">It may be possible under California law that has just come out within the last ten days that he remain eligible for education by the State Department in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.657" offset="7417878">Nevertheless, Jack Smith is 20 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.406" offset="7428850">As I am sure you know, the EHA extends the right for education to handicapped children through the age of 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.121" offset="7459674">Therefore, he still is eligible for education from the Unified School District, and certainly under the auspices of the State Department of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.727" offset="7494156">We suggest, therefore, that the case is not moot, although I cannot represent whether in fact either of these students will ask for further education from the Petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.624" offset="7593735">It may not be, given the inclination of the Court to say that, while it is technically possible for a Petitioner to come within the circumstances again, if in fact it is not likely that they will, then the case could be moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.770" offset="7674296">We suggest, however, caution in that area, because of the very unique nature of the EHA, there is, as this Court has recognized, a very involved administrative process which involves a series of informal meetings and administrative review at the state level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.874" offset="7746708">Levels of either and/or both, state and federal review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.043" offset="7767397">It is not, I think, a coincidence to see that the only two cases that have come to this Court on substantive issues of education under the EHA involve children who started the dispute when they were in kindergarten.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.225" offset="7820060">The cases of Tatro and Rowley were both small children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.146" offset="7831762">In cases at least like this, where we are dealing with the interplay and discipline in education, it is not unreasonable to expect that the children will be somewhat older than that when the process starts against them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3381.699" offset="13661980">Thank you, Ms. Brogna.</text>

            <text syncTime="3386.369" offset="13680683">Your Honor, Respondent in answering a question from Justice Marshall, indicated that it was significant that when an aid was placed in a classroom with John Doe, there were no further incidents during the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.676" offset="13745885">That is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.190" offset="13751945">At Docket No. 84, there is a document which states</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.908" offset="13774829">"there has been one violent incident involving other students in the TMR school since the instructional aide began. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.200" offset="13807952">So there was an incident even after the aide was put in there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3425.072" offset="13835537">With an emotionally disturbed child, I mean, one expects that that is occasionally the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.085" offset="13863540">Was it an incident that reached the point of real danger to another that the previous incidents have?</text>

            <text syncTime="3438.536" offset="13889349">--Your Honor, all we have in the Record is that it was a "violent incident".</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.252" offset="13904187">However, we do have this: No. 137,</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.719" offset="13930100">"he was enrolled in a more restrictive placement called. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.827" offset="13950476">"He barricaded himself in a room; he came out; he knocked out three windows; he attacked a teacher. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.902" offset="13974822">This is not just disruptive conduct which we ordinarily will expect from handicapped children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.259" offset="13996242">This is violent, dangerous conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.243" offset="14004184">That is all in the Record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.508" offset="14009199">Justice O'Connor asked about what... whether the district court did balance the equities and did undertake to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.380" offset="14040755">We think that the district court did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.129" offset="14055697">She made certain conclusionary statements having to do with irreparable injury, stating that it was... irreparable injury had been shown by the Complaint and the Exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.936" offset="14106897">We do not think that that is the kind of balancing that must be undertaken in a finding for an injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3510.412" offset="14176801">Yes, Your Honor, but it was not based on the presentation of the evidence before the court or on trial.</text>
