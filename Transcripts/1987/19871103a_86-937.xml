            <label>Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins</label>
            <text syncTime="12.930" offset="173325">Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.951" offset="185446">The decision of the 6th Circuit in this case reversing the two mail fraud convictions of Thomas Robinson flounders, we submit, on two central misconceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.648" offset="232257">First, the Court of Appeals misread this Court's decision in Griffin against California when it held that the prosecutor's rebuttal summation was an impermissible comment on Mr. Robinson's failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.878" offset="285129">The rule in Griffin, we suggests, forbids only those comments that serve no proper purpose but, rather, invite the jury to treat the defendant's silence as evidence of his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.235" offset="334553">The rebuttal remarks under that standard were not impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.339" offset="351062">Secondly, the Court of Appeals erroneously supposed that it was freer to find plain error in this case because the prosecutor's remarks never objected to at trial implicated Robinson's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.769" offset="412711">We believe that there is no basis to distinguish between constitutional and non-constitutional errors in applying the plain error doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.525" offset="447715">Let me begin, if I might, with the Griffin issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.277" offset="458791">The Court of Appeals discerned the violation of Griffin in the prosecutor's rebuttal summation.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.551" offset="483869">Defense counsel, for his part, had summed up prior to the rebuttal and proclaimed at the outset that his theme in the summation would be the Government's failure to play fair with the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.327" offset="534964">After claiming that the Government had unfairly filtered the evidence in its presentation and that it had consistently denied Robinson a chance to explain his actions, defense counsel then posed this rhetorical question to the jury:</text>
            <text syncTime="117.839" offset="593060">"Now, would you like to get indicted for that without the Government being fair and being able to explain before you, members of your own community, rather than before the agents? "</text>
            <text syncTime="131.067" offset="645932">After the defense lawyer completed his remarks, the prosecutor asked for a side bar and both attorneys approached the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.921" offset="677384">At that point, the Government lawyer objected to the remarks and asked for leave to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.644" offset="700267">The court granted that motion, agreeing with the prosecutor that defense counsel had wrongfully asserted that the Government was responsible for Mr. Robinson's failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.793" offset="744780">Defense counsel, for his part, registered no objection at this time nor did he quarrel with the trial court and the Government's construction of his summation remarks and, therefore, acting pursuant to the trial court's ruling, the prosecutor stated in rebuttal that defense counsel</text>
            <text syncTime="175.606" offset="824087">"has made comments to the extent the Government has not allowed the defendants an opportunity to explain. "</text>
            <text syncTime="181.601" offset="848016">"It is totally unacceptable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="183.300" offset="854807">And he stated further, "He", that is the defendant,</text>
            <text syncTime="186.942" offset="869436">"could have taken the stand and explained it to you. "</text>
            <text syncTime="189.784" offset="880825">"Anything he wanted to. "</text>
            <text syncTime="191.557" offset="887931">"The United States of America has given him throughout the opportunity to explain. "</text>
            <text syncTime="197.849" offset="913008">And, again, the defense counsel made no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.963" offset="929518">Now, the Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit found in these remarks a clear violation of the Defendant's constitutional right not to testify under Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.351" offset="971105">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.951" offset="977478">Griffin does not prohibit each and every reference to a defendant's failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.985" offset="1001616">Rather, Griffin forbids those comments but only those comments that serve no proper purpose and simply invite the jury to treat the defendant's silence as evidence of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.883" offset="1057204">The Griffin case itself, we suggest, confirms this limiting principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.008" offset="1081655">In Griffin, after all, the prosecutor and the trial court told the jury that from the failure of the defendant to testify, it could infer that each and every fact that he could have but failed to explain was more likely than not to be true and that they could use those findings as evidence against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.642" offset="1160231">This Court, reviewing that record, found that the comments of the prosecutor and the trial court in Griffin</text>
            <text syncTime="267.186" offset="1190429">"tendered to the jury for its consideration the failure of the accused to testify. "</text>
            <text syncTime="272.488" offset="1211640">Thus, the Court explained, the comments of the prosecutor and trial court in Griffin</text>
            <text syncTime="278.062" offset="1233896">"solemnized the silence of the accused into evidence against him. "</text>
            <text syncTime="282.526" offset="1251764">The Griffin court reasoned that it is simply improper to infer from the failure to testify that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged and it discerned a number of reasons wholly apart from the defendant's guilt that could account for the defendant's failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.636" offset="1316234">The court in Griffin reasoned that when a prosecutor or trial judge invites the jury to find a defendant guilty based on his failure to testify, it has, in effect, imposed a penalty on the defendant's exercise of a Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.588" offset="1384048">But surely not every comment pertaining or alluding to the failure to testify</text>
            <text syncTime="321.990" offset="1409648">"solemnizes the silence of the accused into evidence against him. "</text>
            <text syncTime="326.174" offset="1426367">and this case, for example, does not fit that profile at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.584" offset="2324038">I think it was a remark very deliberately made, but for a lawful and permissible purpose, that has nothing whatever to do with the concerns that moved the Griffin court.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.181" offset="2362386">It seems to us, for example, that this remark was no more a comment on silence than was the instruction given over the Defendant's objection in Lakeside against Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.229" offset="2414527">There, too, there was a comment in that case by the trial court pertaining to the failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.313" offset="2438873">Specifically, telling the jury that it may draw no adverse inference from the failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.727" offset="2460607">In that case, the defendant made much the same kind of argument that appealed to the 6th Circuit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.461" offset="2491536">He said, well, that's a comment on my silence because it is, of course, related to my failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.477" offset="2519539">But this Court flatly rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.519" offset="2531764">It said that not every comment is a Griffin impermissible comment, and the mere fact that it reminds the jury that the defendant didn't take the stand, a fact which we suggest they rarely need to be reminded about, nevertheless doesn't put it within the Griffin proscriptions, and we think this is no more prohibitive in Griffin than the comments in Lakeside.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.005" offset="2633642">For the same reason that the Lakeside comment was not impermissible, because it did not invite the jury to draw an inference of guilt from the failure to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.321" offset="2678990">That is not what the prosecutor said to the jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.205" offset="2694455">What he said is that, in effect, do not be misled into thinking that we are responsible for the defendant's failure to testify, and that's, indeed, just exactly what the defense lawyer had said in his prior remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.842" offset="2748998">It seems to us that when, as here, there is a proper purpose for the remarks, unrelated to asking the jury to draw an adverse inference of guilt, it promotes and not undermines the truth-finding function of the trial to permit that statement to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.484" offset="2819634">That, we take it, is the clear lesson of this Court's decision in Rafael against The United States, in which this Court held that a defendant's failure to testify at an earlier trial may be used to impeach his credibility when he testifies upon retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.055" offset="2881909">It is likewise the lesson, we think, of a broader line of cases, like Harris against New York and Walder against The United States, that make clear that prosecutors must have considerable latitude during impeachment and rebuttal precisely because the demands of the truth-finding function require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.347" offset="2955052">Now, there's a second reason why we suggest that the rule of Griffin as we have urged it makes a good deal of sense, and that's this: where prosecutor's remarks serve a lawful and proper purpose unrelated to asking the jury to infer guilt from silence, there's no reason to suppose that the jury will understand it in the impermissible way.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.620" offset="3036136">As this Court explained in Donnelly against DeChristoforo, remarks by a prosecutor should not be interpreted in their worst possible way, and when a prosecutor's remarks serve, as we suggest they do in this case, an important truth-finding function, courts should not presume that the jury will take those remarks as forbidden comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.615" offset="3124117">Indeed, that is a particularly appropriate rule to apply in this case because the jury was instructed by the trial court in instructions that were similarly not objected to, to draw no inference or guilt from the failure to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.956" offset="3185452">In short, we believe the rule in Griffin ought not to be construed to stifle argument that serves a legitimate truth-finding purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.671" offset="3228293">In this case, the trial court concluded that the prosecutor's remarks would ensure that the jury was not misled by defense counsel's summation.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.577" offset="3263924">That judgment was plainly correct and should not have been reversed, least of all on the authority of Griffin.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.208" offset="4126487">It isn't, and it isn't for a variety of reasons, and the rule that we have urged today, we think, will settle a great many of those and reduce disputes that have nothing to do with the meaning of Griffin.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.425" offset="4343304">I am, Justice Stevens, not prepared to assert that the defense counsel's remarks are a model of clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.761" offset="4376740">I think there is a good deal of ambiguity to them, which is exactly why the law insists that the participants in the trial make their views known to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.039" offset="4425851">In this case, there's every good reason to indulge the presumption that the trial judge understood these remarks as inviting the response that were made, the response that was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.388" offset="4475170">The language that was used is one that we still don't have an accounting for, except in the way that the trial court understood it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.455" offset="4507457">After all, the defense lawyer said, used the words,</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.429" offset="4519369">"being able to explain, have him explain before you, members of your own community. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.941" offset="4537446">At a minimum, those can be understood the way the trial judge understood them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.884" offset="4553224">Beyond that, of course, the fact that the trial judge understood them that way is a pretty good, indeed, in our view, the best barometer that that's the way they want to be understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.379" offset="4591154">We refer in this connection to the Court's remarks in a different context in Patent against Young, in which the Court said that demeanor, inflection, the flow of the questions and answers can make confused and conflicting utterances incomprehensible and, therefore, went on to hold that the trial court's understanding, the trial judge's interpretation is the best barometer for making sense of what happens during a trial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.785" offset="4688747">And, of course, here was a case where the defense lawyer stood at side bar with the other participants, heard what the trial judge and the Government lawyer thought his remarks meant, and said nothing, and it's not just that he said nothing, but he objected to some other claim that the Government wished to make in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.248" offset="4770667">He objected to that, but conspicuously said nothing about the claim that brings us to court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.132" offset="4794177">It seems to me that that goes beyond inadvertence and calls to mind Justice Frankfurter's remarks in Johnson against The United States that sometimes the failure to object should be understood as acquiescence that nothing is objectionable at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.491" offset="5143591">The Court of Appeals compounded its misreading of Griffin, we think, by its flawed application of the plain error doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.936" offset="5177446">Now, once before in this litigation, this Court granted certiorari to the 6th Circuit and remanded the case in light of The United States against Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.851" offset="5209106">In Young, the Court had reiterated the bed rock principle that contemporaneous objections are the rule and plain error a narrow exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.656" offset="5244319">The plain error exception, the Court explained, is available only to correct particularly egregious errors and, more specifically, those errors that seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.317" offset="5306909">On remand, however, the Court of Appeals adhered to its earlier judgment and it did so, at least in part, because it believed it was freer to find plain error where, as in this case, the error implicated constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.157" offset="5366259">Four reasons counsel against adopting such a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.928" offset="5381410">First, the text of Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the accompanying Advisory Committee Notes offer no basis for making that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.847" offset="5433028">Neither the rule nor the notes treat constitutional claims in any special way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.100" offset="5454030">Second, directing a distinction of this sort violates what we think is the contemporaneous objection rule which is the governing rule to which the plain error doctrine is, as the Court noted in Young, a narrow exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.440" offset="5515366">Objections, after all, alert the trial judge to the fact that a party actually disapproves of something that happened at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.337" offset="5550997">It permits the trial court to rectify that error before it irrevocably taints the verdict, and it frames the issue on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.651" offset="5584225">None of those purposes, we suggest, is well served by distinguishing between constitutional and non-constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.256" offset="5618706">To the contrary, this issue, this case, rather, illustrates why any such distinction would be terribly counterproductive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.879" offset="5685162">It is only because the Court of Appeals thought that this was a Griffin violation that it felt constrained in the first place to treat it as a harmless error and then, on remand, in light of Young, it went on to consider what it took to be the plain error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.298" offset="5750886">As I say, in this case is a terrific illustration of why you need objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.474" offset="5783591">Had an objection been made after all in this case, the trial court would have been alerted to defense counsel's view, at least his presently-held view, that the summation remarks had a different meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.083" offset="5833955">An objection here, had it been made, would have allowed the trial court to refuse to permit the rebuttal just as he refused a second request made by the prosecutor to make a different argument in the rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.942" offset="5885469">Third, this Court's cases construing the plain error doctrine do not stand for any distinction between constitutional and non-constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.839" offset="5933011">Now, Respondent has suggested otherwise in his brief, but that's only because he is taking every claim, every case that the Court has decided under the plain error doctrine, and recharacterized them as constitutional cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.267" offset="5986719">In some instances, by calling them fair trial cases or due process cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.350" offset="6007095">In any event, we think that that misreads the cases which did not, in fact, turn on any constitutional claim, but in a larger sense, Respondent's position illustrates precisely why no such distinction should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.359" offset="6067072">Because the fact that these kinds of claims can be so easily restyled in constitutional terms suggests that trial courts need to hear objections no matter what we label the claim, constitutional or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.491" offset="6387647">If the plain error rule requires that constitution... if non-constitutional errors must be egregious to apply the plain error rule, may constitutional errors be almost egregious or really awful but not quite egregious?</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.202" offset="6446474">The problem is the rule is incapable of rational application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.227" offset="6466536">It leads to inconsistencies, additional layers of review, and is subject to terribly inexplicable results.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.403" offset="6503317">Believing itself free to relax the plain error rule, the Court of Appeals held that the prosecutor's rebuttal remarks in this case violated its conception of the plain error doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.902" offset="6633302">The Court, this Court, should not approve a novel standard for plain error that is capable of producing a judgment like this one.</text>
