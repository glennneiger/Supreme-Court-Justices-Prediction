            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the opinions of the Court to announce in three cases and the first of them, No. 87-505 Chick Kam Choo versus Exxon Corporation, is here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.620" offset="58410">It involves the propriety of an order issued by a Federal District Court enjoining the petitioners from litigating a certain wrongful death action in the Texas state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.225" offset="96862">The question presented is whether this injunction is permissible in light of the Anti-Injunction Act, which generally bars federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.327" offset="137300">We hold that the injunction actually entered is broader than the limited, one we find permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.701" offset="158720">In an opinion authored by Justice O'Connor, accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for the District Court for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.511" offset="194038">Justice White has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
