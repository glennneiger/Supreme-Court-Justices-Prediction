            <text syncTime="8.562" offset="115080">This case comes to us on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.002" offset="136919">In this case, an Illinois State Court Judge exercised his authority under state law to demote and then discharge a probation officer working under his supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.351" offset="190313">The probation officer filed a federal lawsuit for damages under Section 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment, alleging that she had been demoted and discharge on account of her sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.089" offset="241199">The Federal District Court granted summary judgment to the defendant judge on the ground that he was entitled to absolute immunity for his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.686" offset="275576">A divided panel of the Court of the Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.439" offset="298564">In an opinion filed today, we reverse that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.990" offset="320821">In the past we have held that judges are absolutely immune for their acts of adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.130" offset="353421">A decision to demote or discharge a subordinate employee, however, is an administrative or executive act not included within the judicial function itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.978" offset="396785">In this context the traditional justification for absolute immunity does not apply and we hold there is no absolute immunity from suit for damages in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.669" offset="443492">The judgment is unanimous, Justice Blackmun has joined all but part 2 of the opinion.</text>
