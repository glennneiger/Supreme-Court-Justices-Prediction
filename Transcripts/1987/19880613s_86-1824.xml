            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">In the second case, Michigan versus Chesternut, this comes to us from the Court of Appeals of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.655" offset="34586">The respondent, Mr. Chesternut was observing the approach of a Detroit police car on routine patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.053" offset="76173">He began to run and the car followed him and drove alongside him for a short distance and the officers observed Chesternut discarding a number of packets.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.736" offset="118909">The police surmise that the pills subsequently discovered in those packets contained codeine and respondent was arrested and the search of his person revealed other drugs and a hypodermic needle, and he was charged with violations of the Michigan drug laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.554" offset="194142">At a preliminary hearing, the Magistrate dismissed the charges on the ground that Chesternut had been unlawfully seized during the police pursuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.023" offset="232072">And the trial court upheld that dismissal and the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed under precedents interpreting the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.836" offset="275331">The Court also concluded that respondent's flight was insufficient by itself to give rise to the particular suspicion necessary to justify this kind of seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.915" offset="319634">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse that judgment and remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.315" offset="341159">We hold that the officer's pursuit did not constitute a seizure implicating Fourth Amendment protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.298" offset="369162">And thus the charges were improperly dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.687" offset="382746">We feel that no bright-line rule for all investigatory pursuits can be fashioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.345" offset="405316">The appropriate test instead is whether a reasonable man viewing the particular police conduct and within the setting of all the circumstances would have concluded that the police in some way had restrained his liberty so that he was not free to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.706" offset="474802">And under this test, respondent was not seized before he discarded the drug packets.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.072" offset="500193">The police conduct here, that is a brief acceleration to catch up with him and followed by a short drive alongside him, would not have communicated to the reasonable person and attempt to capture him or otherwise intrude upon his freedom of movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.071" offset="568216">The police therefore were not required to have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting respondent of criminal activity in order to pursue him.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.272" offset="609071">The decision is unanimous but Justice Kennedy joined by Justice Scalia has filed a separate concurring opinion.</text>
