            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="132869">We'll hear argument next in No. 86-761, Cynthia Forrester versus Howard Lee White.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.670" offset="167455">Ms. Sedey, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="mary_anne_sedey" startTime="74.001" stopTime="401.727">
            <label>Ms. Mary Anne Sedey</label>
            <text syncTime="74.001" offset="428784">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.969" offset="440696">The Petitioner in this case, Cynthia Forrester, sued her employer, Judge Howard Lee White, for intentional sex discrimination under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, when he demoted and then discharged her from her position as Director of a Juvenile Court diversion program and juvenile probation officer for the Jersey County Illinois Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.429" offset="538498">The issue for decision in this Court is whether a State Court Judge is engaged in a judicial act and therefore protected from a suit for damages by the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity when he makes a personnel decision regarding a Court employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.827" offset="608089">We submit that the Seventh Circuit's ruling that the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity bars Cynthia Forrester's claim for damages expands the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity far beyond the limits created by this Court's decisions and beyond the scope necessary to effectuate its legitimate historical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.227" offset="685725">We ask this Court to rule that a personnel decision is not a judicial act, and that the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity does not bar a suit for damages under Section 1983 for employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.408" offset="738492">This Court's prior decisions clearly articulate what is a judicial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.421" offset="762525">I think it's clear from those decisions that a judge's decision to fire a court employee does not fit within the category of acts which this Court has defined as judicial acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.698" offset="807560">The first principle in trying to determine whether or not an act is a judicial act is that that determination must be made on the basis of the characteristics of the act, not the status of the actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.380" offset="866387">In other words, the fact that the person is a judge does not make every act that that person engages in a judicial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.923" offset="896480">This Court established that principle in a case decided in 1880, Ex Parte Virginia, a case in which the facts were quite similar to the facts of the case of Forrester versus White.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.480" offset="954786">In addition, this Court has held explicitly that judicial acts are acts of adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.617" offset="987282">And I'd direct the Court's attention to its decision in Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union, a 1980 case in which this Court ruled that even an official action taken by a State Court Judge pursuant to explicit statutory authority is not a judicial act when that Judge acts not on parties litigant, and when the act does not arise out of a controversy which is before the Judge for adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.840" offset="1108177">I think that these cases together stand for the proposition that Judges are protected by the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity only when they are engaged in acts of adjudication, by that, we mean acts connected with a case, a controversy, a matter before a Judge for a decision by him or her acting as an adjudicator.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.720" offset="1199710">That principle has also been restated in two other recent decisions of this Court, the 1978 decision in Butz v. Economou and the Court's 1985 decision in Cleavinger v. Saxner.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.948" offset="1260627">In the Butz case, this Court held that hearing officers in Federal administrative agencies are entitled to judicial immunity when they are hearing cases and controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.208" offset="1317679">In that decision, this Court noted that the officials in those cases issued subpoenas, ruled on proffers of evidence, make and recommend decisions, and these are acts which are integral elements of the adjudicatory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.093" offset="1381209">Again, the kinds of things that the hearing officers in these Federal administrative agencies were going to be protected by the Doctrine in connection with were acts of adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.448" offset="1426557">In Cleavinger v. Saxner, 1985 case decided by this Court, the question arose whether prison officials acting as a disciplinary committee holding disciplinary proceedings with regard to prisoners were engaged in judicial acts and therefore protected from suit by these prisoners by the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity, and again, in that case, this Court held as recently as 1985 that when the attributes of judicial proceeding are missing, that there is no judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.791" offset="1579948">The decisions of this Court clearly hold that a judicial act is an act of adjudication, an act connected with or arising out of a case before a judge for adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.380" offset="1630312">The judge's acts at issue in this case were two decisions; a decision to demote an employee, and a decision to discharge an employee, basically personnel decisions about a court employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.779" offset="1695932">Those decisions do not fit within the category of acts which this Court has ruled are judicial acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.276" offset="7493966">The state of the law on judicial immunity as it exists now is that an action for injunctive relief will lie.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.614" offset="7535240">Nonetheless, I think there are still important considerations under the function of judicial immunity and that a judge ought to be able to take those into account and not be risking his personal action for damages and to cut back on some of the time that he must spend involved in litigation in order to fulfill his decision making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.965" offset="7624683">Certainly, his fears of retaliation are realistic fears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.558" offset="7643073">In Pulliam v. Allen, the dissent of this Court noted that actions for discrimination had geometrically increased since the enactment of Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.506" offset="7682884">Last year alone, civil rights employment litigation increased in the Federal District Courts by 14 percent, and this was at a time when other civil actions, the filing of other civil cases had decreased for the first time since I believe 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.249" offset="7745787">The fear is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.936" offset="7756549">It's a realistic fear perhaps a judge that knows more about the process than anyone is going to be more concerned than anyone of risking this kind of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.870" offset="7796255">So the question becomes, when a judge is faced with a decision of retaining a probation officer in whom he lacks confidence, should he have to weigh in the balance the threat of litigation by that particular individual?</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.613" offset="7859262">There's always a balance involved in any case of judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.221" offset="7877653">And the balance has to be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.345" offset="7890191">And I believe the balance in a particular situation where an employee is part of the substantive decision making process that a favorable decision for judicial immunity will further the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.682" offset="7951527">Certainly the judge may be disciplined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.619" offset="7963334">Certainly the judge may be subject to an action for criminal violations of the Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.726" offset="7987680">But I ask this Court to conclude that the balance is in favor of a finding of immunity for this kind of personnel action by a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.283" offset="8025924">Not only is immunity proper as a matter of policy, but I believe it is consistent with the precedent of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.422" offset="8054554">Certainly as a general proposition, it's recognized that judicial immunity shields a judge from liability for damages for his judicial acts taken within the general scope of his jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2001.304" offset="8138041">Do you think it applies, for example, to secretaries, law clerks, other employees in an office?</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.800" offset="8168030">I think that the Seventh Circuit's opinion would apply very likely to an individual like a law clerk, and perhaps to a staff attorney in certain courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.282" offset="8205960">It would not I believe apply to a secretary, and that five days after the Court entered this opinion in Forrester v. White, it entered an opinion in McMillan v. Svetanoff, and in that case, a Judge had fired his court reporter, and the Court did not disavow its reasoning in Forrester v. White, but it explained that in the case of a court reporter, the individual employee did not assist the judge in his decision making functions, and because of that distinction, the relationship was more that of an employee and an employer, rather than a judge and an assistant to a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.170" offset="8369486">As a matter of fact, the McMillan rationale was later applied by the Sixth Circuit in Guercio v. Brody, and in that case, a federal bankruptcy judge was held not immune from an action for damages for firing his personal secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.851" offset="8428209">So I believe that that is where the line is drawn under the Seventh Circuit's reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.429" offset="8450570">And it's a line just based upon the contributions that the employee makes to the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.520" offset="8478887">It's by looking at the relationship to the judicial process that I believe this Court has identified what is a judicial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.656" offset="8515458">In Stump v. Sparkman, the Court established its two criteria; whether the challenged act is a function that is normally performed by a judge, and whether the parties dealt with a judge in his judicial capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.072" offset="8573137">Now, the case law establishes that these criteria were not intended to narrow the scope of what is a judicial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.428" offset="8606573">In Stump, the matter before the Court was an ex parte petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.489" offset="8626740">The person affected by the petition was not before the Court in person or by counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.892" offset="8660386">But nonetheless, it was regarded as a judicial act and entitled to immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.592" offset="10103181">In Agromayer v. Colberg, the First Circuit considered a situation where an individual had applied for a position as a press officer with the Puerto Rican House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.852" offset="10152187">The District Court, in that case, in evaluating the claim of the individual who was refused the position, did apply the kind of bright line test that is being urged by the petitioner today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.924" offset="10208507">And it said, well, hiring or firing, that's administrative, there's no immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.843" offset="10232226">But the Court of Appeals examined the situation and felt that that kind of evaluation was too narrow, because to the extent that a particular employee was considered essential to the legislative process, then his qualifications and his selection ought also to be considered essential to the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.631" offset="10323341">In Browning v. Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives, the District of Columbia Circuit Court echoed similar reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.456" offset="10358658">There, a lawsuit was brought by an official reporter who had been fired by the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.578" offset="10387080">And the Court recognized that the ultimate issue before it was not the personnel act involved, but rather the issue was the duties of that employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.120" offset="10429293">And if the duties implicated speech or debate concerns, then personnel action ought to be found to implicate the same concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.788" offset="10463984">I think that that analysis is equally useful in evaluating a claim of judicial immunity for a personnel decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.598" offset="10499197">If a probation officer's duties are... and I submit that they are... an integral part of the judicial process, then a personnel decision regarding that employee ought also--</text>

            <text syncTime="2970.132" offset="12013359">That the judicial function is much more likely to be gutted by litigation than is the executive function?</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.941" offset="12052542">Another reason is the exercise of the kind of discretion and the policy decisions that have been traditionally made in favor of protecting the judicial process from this kind of interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.342" offset="12106146">It's that kind of policy decision that I believe applies in this case as well as to a litigant, and I would recall that this Court's earliest decisions based upon judicial immunity were not issued because a judge had been sued by a disappointed litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.209" offset="12181692">Rather, they were issued where a judge had disbarred an attorney, stricken an attorney from the rolls of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.098" offset="12209173">It's a different kind of situation, and I suggest that the rationale there, although the Court did discuss the cases of disappointed litigants, the true rationale is the protection of the judicial process by enabling a court to have this authority over the appointment and the removal of these officers of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.699" offset="12291615">A probation officer is also an officer of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.213" offset="12305721">And I think that the decisions made with regard to the probation officer ought also to be recognized as judicial decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.554" offset="12339053">Your Honors, in these days where judicial case loads are increasing and a judge must increasingly rely on the substantive aid of his assistants, such as a probation officer, I believe that a judge is entitled to absolute judicial immunity for his acts, and I would ask this Court to affirm the judgment of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.012" offset="12436856">Thank you, Ms. Kaplan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.855" offset="12444275">Ms. Sedey, you have eight minutes remaining.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Ms. Mary Anne Sedey</label>
            <text syncTime="3081.291" offset="12457963">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.961" offset="12464650">I think it's important to remember that the threat which the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity was developed to protect judges against was in fact the threat of lawsuits against judges by litigants who were dissatisfied with the outcome of a case or a controversy that that judge was deciding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.780" offset="12555974">And basically, there are two reasons why the common law wanted to protect judges against that kind of threat; one was to assure that judges would feel safe making principled, independent judicial decisions, free of the threat of that kind of litigation by parties who were dissatisfied with the result in their cases; and in addition, to protect final judgments from collateral attack, again, collateral attack by litigants who were dissatisfied with the outcome of the cases that were before the judge for adjudication, for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.312" offset="12710097">Judicial immunity is an absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.701" offset="12723576">Most governmental officials have only a qualified immunity and it is the function that judges uniquely carry out in this system of adjudicating cases or controversies and the threat which is unique to judges of litigation by litigants unhappy with the determination of their cases which justifies the granting of judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.143" offset="12829424">The decisions of this Court in all the absolute immunity cases have adopted a functional approach to absolute immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.703" offset="12863592">Only where there's some special function, some unique function that requires protection is absolute immunity extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.651" offset="12903403">And only when the governmental official who is protected by absolute immunity is engaged in that function is judicial immunity a bar to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.960" offset="12948647">The protection extends no farther than the justification that warrants the absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.503" offset="12982815">Since it is the adjudicatory function which is the function to be protected by the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity, adjudication of disputes is the thing that judges do which must be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.764" offset="13035896">They are similar to any other governmental official in hiring, firing, disciplining, assigning work to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.212" offset="13077692">Those are administrative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.226" offset="13089708">All governmental officials are required to carry out those kinds of acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.194" offset="13109561">As an administrator, a judge is required to carry out those acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.895" offset="13128369">There's nothing unique about the judicial function that makes a judge any more likely to be sued say for employment discrimination, than any other governmental official.</text>
