            <text syncTime="8.570" offset="168689">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.122" offset="178824">The question presented in this case is whether the jury instructions given pursuant to Article 37071(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure deprive the jury of any procedure for considering and expressing the view that the mitigating evidence in this case called for the sentence of less than Death.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.983" offset="246325">This is a case involving consideration of mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.387" offset="267954">This Court has held that mitigating circumstances must be rooted in the evidence; they must concern the character of the record and the circumstances of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.612" offset="316855">I would like to talk a little bit about the circumstances of the offense and the character of the Defendant, because those relate to the mitigating circumstances in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.753" offset="361368">It is absolutely undisputed that Mr. Moran was killed; robbed; kidnapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.173" offset="387072">There were no eyewitnesses to the crime itself, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.875" offset="401910">A circumstantial evidence case, the circumstantial evidence pointed to Donald Franklin.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.346" offset="427719">Primarily it linked him to the car in which he was unquestionably abducted in; there was evidence linking her as well to his house and to the outside of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.939" offset="486129">So it was circumstantial evidence that pointed to Mr. Franklin.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.058" offset="498563">Still, there was no physical evidence unequivocally tying Mr. Franklin as her killer.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.580" offset="524685">There was no confession; there was no inculpatory statement; there were two eyewitnesses who identified him at the scene of the abduction; but they were vigorously cross-examined at trial: cross-examined on their opportunity to observe the prior misidentification of one of the witnesses; their motive for testifying; and the lighting conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.427" offset="616114">All in all we don't complain of the sufficiency of the evidence; but we concur that it was sufficient to prove his guilt; of intentional murder beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.301" offset="663552">But we do contend just as clearly that there was some residual doubt; that the facts of this case were not so strong; not so compelling; to remove all doubt whatsoever; and the best evidence of that is the fact that the jury deliberated for four hours and forty-five minutes before reaching its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.833" offset="753727">The primary residual doubt concerned identification; that is, was Mr. Franklin in fact the one seen driving the car away from the scene?</text>
            <text syncTime="165.391" offset="795941">He was found guilty and the court then went into the punishment phase of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.212" offset="819242">At the punishment phase, they presented four reputation witnesses who testified that Mr. Franklin had a bad reputation as a peaceful and law-abiding citizen; they proved that he had twice previously committed the crime of rate; and in addition there was a stipulation that, in seven years of imprisonment he had had a good disciplinary record.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.756" offset="901371">At this point, the jury was retired to deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.327" offset="919657">They had to choose between life and death for Mr. Franklin, and they looked to instructions from the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.481" offset="940241">What they got was two questions, as is typical under the Texas Capital Punishment Submission Scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.301" offset="967618">The question asked whether the crime was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.722" offset="993218">The second question asks whether there was a probability that Mr. Franklin would commit acts of criminal violence constitution a continuing threat to society?</text>
            <text syncTime="224.596" offset="1032715">There was nothing at all in these questions that provided for consideration of the mitigating circumstance we just talked about.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.539" offset="1112545">As I recall, we require only relevant mitigating circumstances to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.193" offset="1135115">Is that a relevant mitigating circumstance?</text>
            <text syncTime="253.228" offset="1147236">Have we ever said that it is?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="254.680" offset="1153087">Your Honor, what the Court said in Lockett was it is required that the circumstances be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.500" offset="1180359">But it's relevant if it goes to the defendant's character, record, or circumstance of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.904" offset="1201988">I think there can be no more compelling circumstance of the offense than a question about whether the Defendant is the one who did it?</text>
            <text syncTime="273.658" offset="1228947">So I do think it is relevant.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>

            <text syncTime="276.876" offset="1241903">That's a circumstance of the trial, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.128" offset="1254860">The offense is what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.580" offset="1260712">Whether there is doubt on the part of the jury whether he did it doesn't seem to me to go to the offense.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="287.751" offset="1285371">It goes to whether or not he did it, though, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.453" offset="1296134">It seems to be like a circumstance of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.638" offset="1308881">The Court has never defined circumstance of the offense; but it just seems like, especially in a capital murder case, where the decision, where the jury has to make that decision of life and death, there can be no more important circumstance of whether he's the one that did it; whether they've got the right man?</text>
            <text syncTime="311.516" offset="1380457">This Court has recognized in addition to recognizing the right to present evidence of the circumstance of the offense, this Court in Lockhart v. McCree recognized that residual doubt can be of benefit to a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.227" offset="1451301">That seems to me to be just another way of saying, if it can be of benefit to him, then it can also can be something that is proffered as the basis of the sentence less than Death.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.939" offset="1522145">That's the argument the state made; took the majority opinion to adopt that argument, to at least say, and the Court said, that it does not wholly vitiate the claimed interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.663" offset="1573032">And I took the Court to say that there is some interest in residual doubt that accrues to the Defendant in a unitary jury system.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.102" offset="1606782">That is a recognition by the Court that it can be beneficial; it's just another way of saying it can be a mitigating circumstance... an irrelevant mitigating circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.708" offset="1645234">Well, or it can affect the jury whether you tell it to affect them or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.196" offset="1667177">I mean, it could be just an expression of the realities, as opposed to the legal niceties.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="389.200" offset="1691209">It couldn't affect the jury if they're honestly obeying their oath in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.485" offset="1708346">The jury in this case took two oaths: one to render a true verdict according to a law and the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.388" offset="1727885">The law was submitted to the jury in the form of the special issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.490" offset="1740320">The special issues do not logically comprehend an inquiry into residual doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.227" offset="1759232">It is true the jury could have nullified their verdict; could have been dishonest; and could have answered that "no" based on residual doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.298" offset="1787549">However, it certainly approaches "arbitrary and capriciousness" for a defendant to have to rely on jury nullification in order to save his life and get the verdict he ought to be entitled to if the jury were considering the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.666" offset="1909071">It's of use to the Defendant and it couldn't be comprehended in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.654" offset="1936969">And it's reasonable to believe that the punishment phase of the trial, that reasonable jurors, when they were deciding the guilt that they had, they deliberated almost five hours, that they still have some of this residual doubt; and it might be such that it could have affected them in this case; and yet there was no way for the jury to take that into consideration under the narrow, special issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.000" offset="2022338">And even if they had considered it for some reason or other, there was no vehicle for them to express that view that that was mitigating evidence substantial enough, to have them vote for a life sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.093" offset="2278756">The state's brief here on page 17 says the jury was instructed to consider all the evidence introduced at both phases of the trial and answering the special issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.535" offset="2336538">Now I gather even if that is so it doesn't satisfy your requests here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="558.375" offset="2367885">That is correct, Your Honor, and I don't believe... I do disagree with the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.843" offset="2381783">The state wasn't explicitly instructed to consider all the evidence in deciding the special issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.712" offset="2401218">That instruction is typically given in Texas, but it was not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.831" offset="2413652">The closest the state came to that was in the special issues, where the jury was told,</text>
            <text syncTime="574.468" offset="2432251">"Do you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt? "</text>
            <text syncTime="577.420" offset="2444058">So we think that the instruction was a little bit less explicit than the state would have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.157" offset="2462971">And it would not satisfy us either, because even if it did, even if that did direct the jury's consideration, there's still that second aspect of the problem with the way the statute was applied in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.686" offset="3369107">It was broader in respect that it tried to bring the statute as applied in this case into compliance with Lockett.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.775" offset="3401498">There were two sorts of instructions: instructions three, four and five, told the jury that they could, that they may consider evidence concerning Defendant's character; record; or circumstance of the offense which, in their opinion mitigates against the punishment of Death; and if they find that it does mitigate against the punishment of Death, they can answer the questions "no".</text>
            <text syncTime="840.057" offset="3494599">The first requested instruction was a little bit different than that; what it told the jury was that it may consider evidence of character; record; and circumstance of the offense and, if that evidence leads the jury to have a reasonable doubt about the true answer to the special issues, then it should answer that question, "no".</text>
            <text syncTime="858.352" offset="3567742">So what we tried to do with our requested instruction was basically ask the jury in every conceivable way the very questions that we think Lockett entitled us to.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.292" offset="3711520">Our second mitigating factor, however, was related to Mr. Franklin's seven years of good behavior in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.862" offset="3737851">It's not true and we don't contend the jury was precluded from considering that altogether, because clearly his prior prison record was relevant to the second special issue; that is, whether he would probably commit acts of violence in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.670" offset="3793022">But Lockett I think requires more than just consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.407" offset="3812039">It requires a certain sort of consideration; in other words, the jury must individually consider any aspect of character; record; or circumstance of the offense proffered as a basis of a sentence less than Death.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.981" offset="3862298">Individual consideration, and furthermore, it must be allowed by the instructions and by the statute, to give independent mitigating weight to that evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1598.581" offset="6528669">We think that, as we have shown in our case, there's going to be a case in which the statute as applied does preclude consideration of mitigating circumstances and does prevent the jury from giving independent weight to those mitigating circumstances and does prevent the jury from giving independent weight to those mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.591" offset="6588751">In effect, what the state is saying in their brief, and their position is that the cause of the mitigating evidence as far as the probability of his prison record because that did not negate the probability of future violence, it should be disregarded entirely.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Zapalac</label>
            <text syncTime="1705.266" offset="6955405">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.574" offset="7004620">In this case Franklin contends that the Texas capital sentencing statute fails to allow for individualized sentencing because it does not provide for instructions to the jury on how to consider mitigating evidence in their deliberations during the punishment phase of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.834" offset="7069717">He relies heavily on the fact that during his particular trial the jury was precluded from considering any residual doubt that it might have had as to Franklin's guild in answering the special issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.260" offset="7123425">First of all, as the Court has already expressed, there has never been any constitutional requirement that the jury take into account residual doubt in determining the punishment that is to be meted out to a capital defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.151" offset="7174938">Secondly, this is not one of the factors that the jury is to be taking into consideration in making its punishment decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.709" offset="7221227">This Court has explicitly said that the relevant mitigating factors that are to be taken into account during the punishment phase concern the circumstance of the offense and the character and record of the individual defendant before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.302" offset="7283608">The Court has further said that the jury is to be concerned with the personal culpability of the individual Defendant, and of the aspects of his character which show whether he can be rehabilitated or whether he is going to continue to be a threat to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.514" offset="7348392">We would contend that residual doubt is simply any residual doubt that the jury might entertain is simply not a circumstance of the offense; is not relevant mitigating evidence; that the jury is required to consider in its punishment deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.707" offset="7409205">But even if it were required to take into account this type of evidence, we would contend that both of the first two Texas special issues which are submitted in every capital murder case, do allow for the consideration of the residual doubt that the jury might entertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.751" offset="7477332">The jury is first of all asked to determine whether the conduct of the defendant, in committing the offense, was committed deliberately and with a reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.059" offset="7530622">Second, the jury is required to determine whether there is a probability that the defendant will commit future acts of violence that will constitute a continuing threat to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.386" offset="7579941">This Court recognized in Adams v. Texas that jurors faced with the possibility of imposing the Death penalty are going to be... may well be affected by that very awesome burden; and that they may approach their deliberations with a great deal of care and thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.947" offset="7654129">And what this means is they may give greater weight to the evidence that's put before them; and that they may raise their standards as to what constitutes reasonable doubt, so that any doubt that they might have as to the defendant's culpability can be taken into account in the punishment deliberations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.039" offset="7922563">The state's position is, then, that any juror who has any residual doubts about the actual guilt of the defendant is not sufficient to rise to the level of a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, still can find expression for those concerns in the Texas special issues to determine that, by giving additional weight to the evidence of deliberateness, as was brought out in Franklin's case, the jury would be able to return a "no" answer on that special issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.094" offset="8050772">Franklin's case is a good example of this: if any juror had any doubt about the actual guilt of the defendant, the evidence that was presented, and the argument that was made with respect to the first special issue, the deliberateness issue, could have given the juror... that juror, a means of expressing his residual doubt; and the ability to answer the question, "no".</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.328" offset="8155680">Franklin argued that the facts of this offense demonstrated that he had not given careful thought, had not engaged in the kind of reflection when he committed the crime, but it was, in his words, a "crime of passion", simply an instinctive reaction to the fact that his victim was beginning to show opposition to his attempt to kidnap and rob.</text>

            <text syncTime="2475.783" offset="10037541">That's correct, because as this Court pointed out, the relevant considerations, the concerns, that the jury is to be looking at is the individual culpability of this defendant; this is the purpose of individualized sentencing; this is why we want to have the juries engage in individualized sentencing, because we want to look at the culpability of this particular Defendant to determine his, for example, his degree of participation in the offense; his degree of the culpability that he bears for the very type of crime that he committed; whether it was a particularly savage and brutal crime; whether there were perhaps mitigating aspects even in the circumstances of the offense, in the way that the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.347" offset="10231787">And also those aspects of the Defendant's character which demonstrate that he is a person who doesn't deserve the Death penalty; that he is a person who can be rehabilitated who is not going to pose a threat to society in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.189" offset="10291138">And it's these concerns that the Texas special issues address; it's these concerns that the jury's attention is focused on during the punishment phase of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.347" offset="10335755">In his brief, Franklin argues that the concepts of "intentional" which is used to define the culpable mental state for capital murder; and "deliberate" is used in the first special issue, are virtually identical; and therefore, a jury who has convicted a defendant of capital murder is almost bound to return an affirmative answer to the first special issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.802" offset="10465531">In fact, this is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.318" offset="10471592">The Court of Appeals has indicated in the past that the two terms are not linguistic equivalents; that the term, "intentional" and the term, "deliberate" are not synonymous; do not mean the same thing; and that juries are able to comprehend this; and in fact, juries are able to comprehend this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.882" offset="10549854">For example, in the Heckert v. State, the defendant went in with an accomplice into a residence with the purpose of burglarizing the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.172" offset="10591023">The co-defendant handed Heckart a weapon; said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.641" offset="10608891">"Stand here; I'm going to go look for things to rob. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.760" offset="10625400">Heckert saw a movement out of the corner of his eye; recognized that it was not his accomplice, who had gone off in a different direction; turned, fired two shots and killed the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.401" offset="10663957">The jury had no trouble determining... deciding, that this was an intentional act that the defendant intended; that he killed the victim at the time he fired the shots; but returned a "no" answer on the first special issue, saying that there was no deliberation; there was no volition; no choosing to engage in this kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.649" offset="10752983">Jurors can perceive the difference between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.434" offset="10764058">The issue is also particularly relevant in determining the actual culpability of the... defendant in the case of the Law of Parties or Accomplices, where the degree of participation of the actual defendant may be less than having actually committed the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.549" offset="10856532">Although guilty of capital murder as a party or as an accomplice, the degree of participation was not sufficient that the jury would find that his behavior was deliberate and culpable enough to warrant the Death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.725" offset="10917240">There are numerous cases reported in Texas where the Law of Parties has been at issue; the defendant has been convicted under the Law of Parties, but the jury has come back with a "no" answer to the first issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.449" offset="10972202">Finally, in Franklin's own case, the process of arguing that Franklin's actions were not deliberate began with the process of jury selection; and during voir dire, Franklin questioned the... members extensively on their understanding of intentional and deliberate, and their ability to distinguish the two terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.998" offset="11066347">At least one potential juror was excluded because the two terms were indistinguishable in that persons's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.588" offset="11092679">During the punishment phase of the trial, during his argument, counsel argued at length that all of the facts of the offense showed that this was not a careful, thoughtful, reflective action on the part of Franklin; that it was a result simply of a crime of passion; an instinctive reaction to the situation; and was not something that warranted the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.738" offset="11205319">It was not a deliberate act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.005" offset="11210334">He went through again and read numerous definitions of the term, "deliberate" and reiterated that these actions did not fall within the terms of deliberate conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.493" offset="11988365">The jury clearly was aware that they were to consider all of the evidence that had been presented at both phases of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.481" offset="12016264">The jury was also instructed that they were to find they were not to answer one of the specials... either of the special issues in the affirmative, unless they were persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer should be "yes".</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.241" offset="12067360">And they were also instructed that the only way that they could return a 12 members, unanimously agreed that the answer should be "yes".</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.947" offset="12110200">So it's very clear that Franklin had the protections of the jury system; had the protections of the reasonable doubt standard; and that the Texas special issues allow for the consideration of all the mitigating evidence that he presented.</text>
