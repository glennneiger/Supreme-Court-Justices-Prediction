            <text syncTime="8.045" offset="32078">This case comes to us by writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.489" offset="53917">The petitioner is the mother of an illegitimate child.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.134" offset="68441">She sued the respondent for child support alleging that he is the child's father.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.362" offset="89443">The Court dismissed the suit as barred by Pennsylvania six-year statute of limitations for paternity actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.582" offset="118282">The statute effectively limits the time within which suits may be brought to obtain child support for illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.403" offset="149525">By contrast, suits for child support for legitimate children may be brought at any time during their minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.148" offset="180558">We hold in the opinion filed today that the Pennsylvania statute of limitations at issue violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.233" offset="220891">The statute discriminates between legitimate and illegitimate children and is not substantially related to an important government objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.040" offset="260075">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment below and the opinion is unanimous.</text>
