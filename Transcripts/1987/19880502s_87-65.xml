            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="9.266" offset="36989">Well, this case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.918" offset="59664">The respondents are a newspaper and its executive editor and they in fact violated a temporary restraining order issued by the District Court in a civil suit to enjoin dissemination of memoranda concerning the plaintiff's deceased father.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.817" offset="135210">The Court appointed a private attorney to prosecute the respondents for criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.053" offset="160183">It declined or asked the United States Attorney to pursue the matter because of his representation of the federal defendants in the underlying civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.435" offset="201665">The District Court found respondents in criminal contempt, but the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.786" offset="231131">The Solicitor General denied the special prosecutor authority to represent the United States in this Court in seeking reinstatement of the contempt judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.861" offset="275435">Nevertheless, the prosecutor filed a petition for certiorari, and that writ was granted and he briefed and argued the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.447" offset="313783">We now dismiss the writ of certiorari for want of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.842" offset="331337">This is because the special prosecutor lacks authority to represent the United States before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.527" offset="362057">Section 518(a) of what is known as Title 18 or 28 of the United States Code, empowers the Solicitor General or his designee to conduct and argue suites in this Court and I quote, “in which the United States is interested.”</text>
            <text syncTime="110.756" offset="442932">This is such a case if a judicially initiated contempt citation were not a case "in which the United States is interested,” the policies underlying the statute that the United States speak with one voice before this Court are such as it could be undermine by unauthorized certiorari petitions filed by United States Attorneys or by special prosecutors at the behest of district judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.228" offset="560901">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion but joins the opinion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.637" offset="582531">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined therein by the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.718" offset="606772">Justice Kennedy took no part.</text>
