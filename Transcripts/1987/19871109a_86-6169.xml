            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="188214">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.260" offset="200021">In this case Oklahoma has decided that a fifteen year old boy lost his moral entitlement to live because he committed a brutal murder, the killing of the ex-husband of his sister.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.150" offset="251535">According to the prosecution evidence the motive for this murder was revenge, revenge for the ex-husband's abuse of the boy's sister.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.939" offset="286748">This case comes before this Court on Certiorari to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.910" offset="310571">Petitioner asked this Court to vacate the sentence of Death, but not the judgment that Wayne Thompson was guilty; and not the judgment that he deserves punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.135" offset="351531">Two basic issues in this case relate to one fundamental principle: the principle that Youth bears on the fundamental justice of the Death Penalty and emotion and prejudice do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.125" offset="403463">First, does this principle require a minimum chronological age, or at least standards and instructions that tell the sentencing authority that their examination of non adulthood should not be truncated.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.285" offset="460096">Second, did introduction of inflammatory photographs of the murder victim's decomposing remains undermine the reliability of this Death sentencing process?</text>
            <text syncTime="95.128" offset="519446">Wayne Thompson was still a child under state law when he shot and killed the ex-husband of his sister.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.132" offset="547450">According to the prosecution's most incriminating evidence, the boy on the night of the murder shortly after the crime, confessed to his mother and explained to her that his... sister</text>
            <text syncTime="115.023" offset="599068">"would not have to worry about her ex-husband any more. "</text>
            <text syncTime="119.510" offset="616935">Wayne was certified to stand trial as if he were an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.397" offset="636579">The jury was told that he was an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.515" offset="652984">The jury was instructed that Youth is a relevant mitigating circumstance they could consider, but they were not told that Youth is a relevant mitigating circumstance of great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.074" offset="699273">They were told that they could decide for themselves what were and were not mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.096" offset="731352">These were the instructions before the jury that sentenced Wayne to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.464" offset="748801">Under these circumstances and in a very real sense, this case comes before the Court presenting this Court with the first opportunity to decide whether or not Wayne Thompson was too young to be condemned to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.558" offset="801151">We submit under the circumstances of this case, as well as under circumstances generally applicable to a class of children and adolescents, it is most inappropriate under the Eighth Amendment, under the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, to inflict the Death Sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.387" offset="896446">The reasons for treating Youth in a special manner have been recognized by this Court on a number of occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.827" offset="930300">We submit that these factors, these reasons for treating Youth in a special way are compelling in this particular circumstance: first children and adolescents are simply too inexperienced to be judged by the same standards applicable to adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.971" offset="998846">They have not been around long enough to formulate the understanding, the capacity for self-control, to be judged by standards according to adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.279" offset="1048060">The question is not merely whether they know the difference between right or wrong, but whether they have the experience to apply those standards, to resist the stress, the trauma, the difficulties... of particularly difficult occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.872" offset="1106470">We submit that, in addition to that, it is quite plain that children, adolescents, are far more vulnerable to volatile, impulsive, self-destructive behavior, and this, recognized by this Court in the past, is grounds for treating Youth, youths, in a different manner, particularly when the punishment is Death.</text>

            <text syncTime="953.953" offset="3954757">We submit, however, that because of the way in which the Oklahoma... excuse me, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, described these photographs, facts that they found in relation to the inflammatory nature of these photographs, the constitutionally unacceptable risk that the jury was distracted from its duty, distracted from the true assessment of what is an appropriate... sentence, is plain and apparent on the Record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.195" offset="5547704">The best we have in our brief is the difference in proportion, the differential proportion based upon arrests for criminal homicide, and of course, that presents a problem about which arrests for criminal homicide are in fact capital offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.339" offset="5620325">With respect to the uncertainty of the judgment, I would like to draw attention to the brief, the amicus brief for the American Society for Adolescent Psychiatry, which eloquently summarizes the evidence that what is happening with respect to the juvenile Death Sentence is not a situation where these individuals are being sentenced based upon a judgment that they have a maturity beyond their years; they are being sentenced to death despite their evident immaturity and retarded development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.412" offset="5756579">The fact is that the American Psychiatric Association, when it discusses the diagnosis of "antisocial personality", states very clearly that such a diagnosis should not be made until someone has had the time, the experience, to show the full longitudinal pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.843" offset="5842366">It is only then when an individual is in a sense ready for the kind of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.897" offset="5870578">The fact is that these individuals, this class of juveniles and adolescents, share characteristics universally regarded as mitigating, as deserving less punishment, or at least a more generous judgment in the final analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.577" offset="5953229">They share characteristics which make that they should be held responsible to the superlative degree of "cruel and unusual".</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.535" offset="5997115">We submit that in this case, tradition yields a principle of "decent restraint".</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.372" offset="6020416">Decent restraint, that the judgment and the punishment of them should be more careful and sensitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.961" offset="6050823">The only way to ensure that this tradition is vindicated is through a rule that leaves no latitude for evasion, a minimum chronological age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.083" offset="6095231">But short of that, short of that we suggest that when a state seeks to kill a human being for the crimes of childhood or adolescence, it must show at a minimum that it made a reasoned, careful judgment based upon the reality of non-adulthood, without the influence of emotion or prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.099" offset="6179345">For these reasons we pray that this Court vacate the sentence of Death in this case and remand to Oklahoma.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.047" offset="6279133">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.583" offset="6289268">In my view, this case involves two questions: whether it was cruel and unusual punishment to impose the Death sentence upon the Petitioner in this case; and whether this Court should set as an aspect of the United States Constitution a minimum chronological age under which no state could go in imposing the Death sentence regardless of the circumstances of the individual crime irrespective of the individual of the defendant's maturity and background in each individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.952" offset="6406715">In the present case, the Petitioner murdered the victim one and one-half months prior to the Petitioner's 16th birthday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.606" offset="6437330">The Petitioner had nine contacts with law enforcement officers, seven of which occurred prior to the murder in this case; four of those incidents involved assaults on a person and two of those involved assault with a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.634" offset="6501487">Testimony at trial revealed that Petitioner announced to witnesses as he left his house on the night of the murder,</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.455" offset="6524788">"We are going to kill Charles. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.324" offset="6536282">The victim died after having been brutally beaten; having his throat cut; and having been shot in the back of the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.310" offset="6568152">After the murder, the Petitioner told witnesses on two different occasions that he had cut the victim's throat and shot him in the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.266" offset="6600021">The Petitioner made other several other callous comments after the murder that revealed that he felt no remorse, a fact that was corroborated by the testimony by the psychologist who examined him and by his juvenile officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.343" offset="6656341">Concerning the question of the Petitioner's age, the State contends that the adoption of the Petitioner's argument that this Court should set a minimum chronological age would require this Court to engage in artificial and arbitrary line drawing with regard to the decision whether to impose the Death sentence upon a young murderer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.339" offset="6736276">In its Decisions over the past eleven years, this Court has stressed the need for individualized decisions, regarding the Death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.945" offset="6770757">And we contend also that there is no reason why age should be given any greater consideration or any greater weight than any other mitigating circumstances such as those involving mental retardation or mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.836" offset="6826241">Furthermore, a significant class of violent criminals in this country should not automatically be immunized from the possibility of receiving the Death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.644" offset="6865530">It is unquestioned that this Court has itself recognized in the Eddings case that young criminals increasingly engage in violent crime and to announce in advance that none of them, under any set of circumstances, could receive the Death sentence regardless of the maturity that they displayed or the viciousness of the crime that they commit would be in our view, to send the wrong message.</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.489" offset="11528909">The Record is clear in this case that this individual acted of his own free will and volition in this particular case, and there is no inference whatsoever that he was dominated by any of these other individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.165" offset="11591603">As I have noted, we think that the... it is important that the states... even states that have set a minimum age for the imposition of the Death sentence, cannot agree on what that minimum age should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.306" offset="11644161">And it was unclear until the oral argument what the Petitioner himself thinks the minimum age should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.912" offset="11674568">We believe that common sense tells us that, if asked what the minimum age for the imposition of the Death Penalty should be, most people would say that it depends on the individual facts of the case, including the seriousness of the crime and what that individual defendant is really like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.624" offset="11741441">We contend that the objective factors of this case do not support the Petitioner's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.092" offset="11763280">As we have noted, all state supreme courts that have ruled on this issue, have rejected the contention that age alone should bar imposition of the Death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.383" offset="11800478">Nineteen states, as I have noted, permit the execution of a person who was under the age of 16 at the time of the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.620" offset="11829422">By my count, there are presently 38 persons on Death Row in this country who are under the age of 18 at the time of the commission of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.809" offset="11866202">These were people who were sentenced by judges and juries in 14 different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.980" offset="11886891">In a one-year period of time from 1985 until 1986, three persons who were 17 at the time of the commission of the murder, were executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.650" offset="11921582">We contend that there is no unambiguous trend in this country with regard to the raising or lowering of the age for the Death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.155" offset="11955541">As I previously mentioned, Congress in 1984 lowered the age for transfer for violent crimes from 16 to 15, which in my view... also in response to Justice Scalia's question that, under the Federal Air Piracy Act, which was mentioned by this Court in the McCleskey case, a fifteen-year-old person, if he is properly transferred pursuant to the certification transfer statutes, could receive the Death Penalty if the procedure is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.425" offset="12064628">Therefore, the general public sentiment and the objective factors that would justify the abolition of the Death Penalty for young murderers is not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.697" offset="12105693">We think that the crime itself is relevant in proportionality principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.601" offset="12129308">One who reads the facts in many of these cases cannot help but think that individual states and individual juries are justified in imposing the Death sentence in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.409" offset="12172566">In the present case the Petitioner was convicted and sentenced because of his direct role in a calculated, savage murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.146" offset="12203495">He was certified to stand trial as an adult after two hearings, one where the certifying judge determined prosecutive merit; another when the judge weighed six factors under our certification statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.038" offset="12251143">I might note that our certification statute is very similar to the federal transfer statute, Title 18, Section 5032.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.643" offset="12285520">These factors included first the willful nature of the act; whether the crime involved an act against the person; another consideration made by the certifying judge was the sophistication maturity of the Petitioner in his distinguishing right from wrong as determined by his psychological evaluation; his home; his environmental situation; his emotional attitude and pattern of living; and finally the record and past history and prospects for rehabilitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3117.897" offset="12610483">We contend that the Petitioner in this case was the beneficiary of a number of rehabilitative efforts in this case over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.884" offset="12638486">He received counselling; he received... he had a tour at a home outside of... in Oklahoma City; he received probationary services; he had a test... had testing done on him done six months before the murder, and none of these seemed to make any difference, a fact revealed to him... a fact testified to by the probation officer at the time he was certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.602" offset="12737334">I want to note before I close that in their brief, the Petitioner mentioned the fact that the Tenth Circuit has said that our</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.505" offset="12764919">"aggravating circumstance, especially as heinous, atrocious or cruel. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.207" offset="12779757">has been found by the Tenth Circuit to be overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.342" offset="12792295">I want to point out that the "aggravating circumstance" that was mentioned was mentioned in the Reply Brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.377" offset="12808491">It was not mentioned until that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.577" offset="12813298">The instruction in the particular case is not the same instruction that was used which is the subject of the Cartright v. Maunard case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.833" offset="12846317">In this particular case, the jury was instructed that</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.785" offset="12858124">"the aggravating circumstances, the heinous, atrocious or cruel, the murder must be preceded by torture or serious physical injury. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3270.195" offset="13219763">For these individuals who are the ones receiving the Death sentence, it is extremely difficult to believe that deterrence plays any meaningful role in the kinds of thought processes that led to these crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.335" offset="13272321">Certification has been discussed and perhaps my answers were garbled before, so I wanted to focus on that: we do not challenge the certification of Wayne Thompson before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.810" offset="13318192">The certification process is designed to assess the capacity for rehabilitation within the Oklahoma system, and it refers as much to the Oklahoma system as it does to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.385" offset="13364481">But more to the point, it does not focus on the question of moral culpability for purposes of the Death Penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.391" offset="13396560">It is designed to avoid a prospect that I think everyone in this room would find very difficult to accept, the prospect of a manifestly unfair short incarceration period for a serious offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.916" offset="13454656">If Wayne Thompson had not been certified to stand trial as if he were an adult, he would have been under the rehabilitation system for something less than three years, a plainly short time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.541" offset="13501154">The question of certification, as decided by the Oklahoma trial courts, does not go to the question of the justice of the Death Penalty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry F. Tepker, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3392.391" offset="13708462">--That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.891" offset="13710552">That is right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.676" offset="13721628">The question of rehabilitation has been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.478" offset="13732808">We do suggest that it is appropriate for the jury to make a judgment about rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.548" offset="13757154">With respect to Wayne Thompson, I would point out that the jury was asked by the prosecutor to find if this individual would commit acts of violence in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.839" offset="13798323">And they refused to so-find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.791" offset="13810130">That is a clear indication that this question of rehabilitation was not brought home to them as being of a primary importance or focus or purposes of assessing the Death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.766" offset="13862062">Moreover, the State's description of the rehabilitation efforts of Wayne Thompson, while accurate to a degree, are somewhat exaggerated: despite the seriousness of previous incidents involving law enforcement, Wayne Thompson was never institutionalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.577" offset="13929249">He was referred to a private church home for something like a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.345" offset="13944295">He did receive some counselling both at school and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.647" offset="13957566">But there was never any effort, despite the seriousness of these offenses, to institutionalize him in the juvenile justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.253" offset="13991943">Given that fact, I think it is fair to say that the rehabilitative potential of Wayne Thompson is up in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.807" offset="14018170">It is uncertain, and not at all clear that the jury did not make the right decision when it refused to find a propensity for future violence... in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.066" offset="14075221">One last point: counsel for the State has conceded that there is a bottom somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.339" offset="14108344">I suggest that if one is going to make a careful assessment of where that bottom is, the only concept that is meaningful in the law is the concept of non-adulthood, to draw a line right in the middle of the class of non-adults; right in the middle of the class who share these characteristics of inexperience and immaturity; right in the middle of this class of individuals who are so difficult to judge at Age 15 or 13 or 14... makes no sense whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.977" offset="14234881">Non-adulthood, then, should be the concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.360" offset="14244390">The tradition of criminal jurisprudence and American jurisprudence is that these non-adults ought to be treated differently and judged more fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.535" offset="14281066">Thank you very much.</text>
