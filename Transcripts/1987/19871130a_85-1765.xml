            <text syncTime="80.785" offset="462969">This case presents the question whether large punitive damage awards may constitute excessive fines, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.724" offset="502780">This issue stems from a Mississippi jury verdict in favor of Appellee Crenshaw in his suit for a $20,000.00 insurance benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.887" offset="579371">The jury verdict was affirmed four years later by a divided Mississippi Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.541" offset="606016">That Court then added an automatic 15 percent, $243,000.00 penalty, to the judgment against Appellant, for prosecuting an unsuccessful appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.837" offset="1295231">We believe that the Contract Clause argument, though, in this case, forms substantially a part of the Due Process Clause argument in the sense that the Supreme Court of Mississippi was in the process of changing subjective standards with respect to the imposition of punitive damages in connection with the enforcement of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.750" offset="1374852">So we have not abandoned that issue, but it is clearly subordinate to the Due Process Clause issue, and, we submit, to the punitive damage question under the Eighth Amendment, which we would prefer to discuss.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="354.647" offset="1558440">Let me answer that in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.933" offset="1571606">In this Court, in 1966, in Giacco v. Pennsylvania, held that a $230.00 penalty imposed upon a litigant after a trial in a criminal case in which the litigant was acquitted, held that a $230.00 penalty imposed upon the individual because of reprehensible conduct, violated the Due Process Clause of the Constitution, that a penalty of that nature and that amount could not be imposed on the basis of a subjective, elastic standard, such as the word "reprehensible".</text>
            <text syncTime="394.856" offset="1719250">In this case, the standard pursuant to which my client was punished is no more clear and no more specific than it was in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.962" offset="1751642">The only difference is, in this case the penalty was $1,600,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.366" offset="1769301">And that is the principal focus of our Due Process Clause objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.818" offset="1783094">Turning to the punitive damage issue, if I may, I don't need to spend too much time reiterating the principal characteristics of punitive damages to this Court, because they are well-known to this Court and have been discussed in many Opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.077" offset="1840145">But I would briefly like to touch upon four principal characteristics of punitive damages which have been mentioned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.581" offset="1870134">In the first place, punitive damages are not damages in the traditional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.968" offset="1891658">Damages generally and traditionally are pecuniary reparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.039" offset="1912034">But as repeatedly characterized by this Court, punitive damages are not to compensate victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.776" offset="1938888">They are only windfalls.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.543" offset="1945993">As counsel for Mr. Crenshaw stated in his opening statement, we are asking you to return a sizable verdict that is not to compensate Lloyd Crenshaw.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.628" offset="2058320">That was my next point.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.680" offset="2074516">The first characteristic being that they are not compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.366" offset="2085278">The second characteristic which this Court has identified is that they are in the nature of a punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.520" offset="2109938">They are private finds, as articulated by this Court, levied by civil juries.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.876" offset="2139299">That comes, of course, out of the word "punitive", and on jury instructions, and the history of punitive damages, which have been considered over and over again by this Court, make it very clear, as characterized by Chief Justice Rehnquist, punitive damages are quasi-criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.718" offset="2202725">The third characteristic that is worthy to focus on, and before I do that, with respect to the characterization of punitive damages as criminal and as for punishment purposes, again, the same theme was reflected in the jury instructions and the arguments to the jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.763" offset="2270852">The third characteristic which has been mentioned by this Court is that the standards for the imposition of punitive damages and subjective and elastic.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.369" offset="2305334">The standards for imposing punitive damages range from reprehensible to wanton, to negligence, to bad faith, and, in Mississippi, even rudeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.474" offset="2341696">As Justice Brennan put it, in one case, juries award punitive damages in their largely uncontrolled discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.312" offset="2369072">The fourth characteristic, beyond the standard, is that the magnitude of punitive damage awards is utterly capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.484" offset="2397807">In words familiar to this Court, punitive damages are awarded in wholly unpredictable amounts, bearing no necessary relation to the actual harm caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.507" offset="2437827">Juries have awarded, in this country, up to $3 billion in punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.661" offset="2458516">Appellate Courts in this country have sustained jury awards up to $1 billion in punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.814" offset="2483071">With those four characteristics of punitive damages in mind, I would like to turn to the Eighth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.561" offset="2562065">That's about it, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.411" offset="2569484">The Appellate Courts of this country are not clear in their articulation as to why awards are upset or why punitive damage awards are sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.001" offset="2603861">The words of the Court in this case were to the effect that the punitive damage, it did not matter whether it was high enough to shock the conscience, simply that it was not too high to shock the judicial conscience of the Supreme Court of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.510" offset="2665823">The dissent pointed out that he couldn't understand the difference between shocking the conscience and shocking the judicial conscience, and I won't go into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.966" offset="2695707">But that is about as subjective and as elusive, and as elastic, as the standards are at the Appellate Court level, as they are at the jury level.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.972" offset="2727681">Before turning to the affirmative reasons why we submit that punitive damages are subject to the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, I think it is my obligation to discuss very briefly the statement of this Court in Ingraham v. Wright that the Eighth Amendment applies only in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.184" offset="2796540">We submit that that is not dispositive of the issue that we bring before you today, for several reasons, but I will only mention three here.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.603" offset="2826215">In the first place, as this Court is well aware, Ingraham applied only to the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.907" offset="2855472">The Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment has a separate history, independent of the Bail and the Punishment Clauses of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.530" offset="2889954">Secondly, this Court noted in Footnote 37 of Ingraham v. Wright, that some punishments, though not labeled criminal by the state, may be sufficiently analogous to criminal punishments to justify application of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.475" offset="2957768">We submit, and I think some of the things that I have said already today, support the proposition, that this punishment is sufficiently analogous, though not labeled criminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="745.567" offset="3122130">That is a reason to distinguish the Ingraham case, which was not focusing on the Excessive Fines Clause, and on the history of the Excessive Fines Clause, but not a reason to take that one level of punishment, which may be a companion in many cases in the same case, and distinguish it from application to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.763" offset="3194855">The third reason, and your question leads me to that, is that the historical analysis in Ingraham, as Justice White put it, in his dissenting Opinion, was vague and inconclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.987" offset="3239786">We believe that the reason for that was that was, as we have examined the briefs, and the historical analysis of the Eighth Amendment, tracing back to the English Bill of Rights and to Magna Carta, was not thoroughly briefed in Ingraham v. Wright.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.128" offset="3288374">And that leads me to the affirmative reasons why we believe that the Eighth Amendment does apply, the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment does apply to punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.000" offset="3327871">There are three principal reasons why we advance affirmatively, that the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause does apply to punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.256" offset="3360889">They are, the language in the drafting and legislative history of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment; the purpose of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment; and, as I have mentioned, the historical antecedents of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.032" offset="3424001">First of all, the legislative history, the language and drafting.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.269" offset="3440929">Nothing in the text of the Eighth Amendment itself limits it to criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.657" offset="3466424">There is no suggestion in the Amendment, in the text of the Amendment, that it should be limited to criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.561" offset="3490039">And that is interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.494" offset="3493800">Because the Eighth Amendment was debated immediately after the Fifth Amendment during the First Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.750" offset="3522849">During the debate of the Fifth Amendment, in order to ensure that the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment would not extend beyond the criminal cases, the framers added a clause so that it would read:</text>
            <text syncTime="859.391" offset="3577392">"nor shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. "</text>
            <text syncTime="864.794" offset="3599022">The word "criminal" also appears in the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.096" offset="3612187">Thus, the legislative history of the drafting of the Eighth Amendment suggests that the framers knew how to include the word "criminal" if they had wished to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.269" offset="3648863">Similarly, as this Court has noted, the Eighth Amendment traces its history back to the English Declaration and Bill of Rights of 1689.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.458" offset="3681673">In the Preamble to the Declaration of Rights, the word "criminal" cases modifies the Bail Provision of the Declaration of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.898" offset="3715423">But when enacted in a statute in the actual statutory portion of the Bill of Rights, the English Bill of Rights, the word "criminal" cases is not included as a modifier either of the Excessive Fines Clause provision or of the Bail and Cruel and Unusual Punishments provisions of the Declaration of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.192" offset="3784596">Furthermore, this Court has noted that the Eighth Amendment also can be traced to the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.715" offset="3822734">It is interesting that Section 9 of the Virginia Declaration of Rights prohibits excessive bail, fines, and cruel and unusual punishment, without any reference to criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.404" offset="3861500">Section 8, the immediately preceding section of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, sets out a whole series of rights and protections in capital or criminal prosecutions--</text>
            <text syncTime="941.045" offset="3904027">So that the language and the legislative history of the Eighth Amendment does not support limiting that Amendment, the Excessive Fines Clause, to criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.150" offset="3940390">From the standpoint of a purpose of analysis, as suggested by Justice White in the dissent in Ingraham v. Wright, I think that I need no say any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.006" offset="3975812">Punitive damages serve the same function as criminal fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.577" offset="3994098">So therefore, from the standpoint of the analogy suggested in Footnote 37 of Ingraham v. Wright or the purpose of analysis, it is quite clear that the Excessive Fines Clause should apply to punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.218" offset="4040700">From the standpoint of the historical analysis, the more one examines the history of the Excessive Fines Clause, and its antecedent, the Excessive Amercements Clause of Magna Carta, the more one is stricken by the similarity between punitive damages and amercements as they were understood in the 13th Century and throughout the period of history, leading up to the word 1689.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.571" offset="4158147">The history demonstrates that amercements, the concept of proportionality, in the first place, does not date from Magna Carta.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.427" offset="4197539">It dates back to ancient Hebrew law, to ancient law, even to municipal law in England, prior to Magna Carta.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.448" offset="4229618">The concept of proportionality in punishment is based upon the proposition that disproportionate, unduly severe, arbitrary or capricious punishment is unwise and unjust, and it does not support a proper system of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.756" offset="4282907">Saxon law did not distinguish between crimes and torts, and English law combined the concept of private and public wrongs, and remedies for private and public wrongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.648" offset="4326375">Amercements, and later, fines, were imposed for virtually every form of conduct, including civil misconduct, and upon civil litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.004" offset="4359812">By 1689, the date of the Declaration of Rights in England, the terms "amercements" and "fines" were relatively interchangeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.025" offset="4395965">And in the Colonial charters, the concept of moderation in punishment, both in the area of fines and in amercements, were embodied, those concepts were embodied in those charters as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.433" offset="4449569">Book III of Blackstone discusses private wrongs, and it is interesting to examine that history, because Blackstone discusses, in chapter after chapter, that many of the things which he describes as private wrongs contain both a private component and a public component.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.081" offset="4532116">Certain of what we recognize today as torts, those which were regarded as breaching the peace and those such as libel, which were regarded as sufficiently serious, were regarded as wrongs to an individual, but also wrongs to the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.090" offset="4592197">The wrong to the individual was recompensed by damages payable to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.244" offset="4612782">The wrong to society was dealt with in the form of a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.129" offset="4628351">And it is interesting, if we look at that history, and compare it to what precisely we are talking about in this case, the concept of a private and a public wrong, and a private remedy and a public remedy in the same general context, the Consumers Union Amicus brief which supports the Appellee in this case, talks about that there were two separate awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.061" offset="4720093">And there are two separate awards in these cases... civil damages to private litigants and amercements to the Crown in the form of public damage, in English history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.500" offset="4757814">Mr. Crenshaw's opening statement, his counsel's opening statement in this case said, we really have two lawsuits to present to you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.523" offset="4789892">The first is Mr. Crenshaw's lawsuit for the policy benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.558" offset="4806088">The second is to penalize Bankers Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.260" offset="4816850">The same is true in the closing statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.462" offset="4825732">The recognition in this case, the recognition in history, the recognition in the law of punitive damages, that there is a public and a private component.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.918" offset="4863557">The private component is dealt with in the form of damages, the public component in the form of either wites, which was the pre-Magna Carta term; amercements, the Magna Carta term; fines, the English Bill of Rights term; or today, punitive damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.548" offset="5045996">They were not well-briefed, and in both of these cases the court did not really focus on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.083" offset="5064178">All of this seems to us to support overwhelmingly the proposition that the Excessive Fines provision should apply to punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.689" offset="5098555">It seems to me that the next question, logically, therefore, is what is meant by "excessive".</text>

            <text syncTime="1261.120" offset="5184341">But there is no question, because of the word "excessive", that to the extent that the Excessive Fines Clause is applicable, the question of proportionality is a key consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.100" offset="5256230">We have articulated this in our Brief, and let me just restate it briefly, that the objective standards to which this Court should turn in determining whether a fine is excessive is to those objective indicia which have been recognized in this Court's other Eighth Amendment cases, the legislative enactments from the states... in this case, the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.382" offset="5353405">As we have pointed out, the concept of proportionality in punishment takes into consideration what the society... in this case, the society of the State of Mississippi... considers as a whole, in terms of the scheme of things, what is most severe based upon the judgments of the lawmakers of Mississippi.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1596.623" offset="6526303">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.465" offset="6585654">Although I will certainly address the punitive damages issues, I would like to begin by addressing the rationality of the appeal penalty statute, because in our view, that is the only issue that is properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.357" offset="6637271">The penalty statute serves several legitimate state interests, including the indisputably legitimate interest of conserving judicial resources, protecting the integrity of judgments, and providing some measure of compensation for the real but difficult to measure intangible costs of defending appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.472" offset="6725774">The statute applies equally to all parties who appeal from money judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.876" offset="6747299">If Lloyd Crenshaw had unsuccessfully appealed from the same judgment at issue here, he would have incurred precisely the same 15 percent penalty that Bankers Life incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.165" offset="6792543">The statute conserves judicial resources by discouraging marginal appeals without preventing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.290" offset="6829010">Discouraging appeals in marginal cases is perhaps a more important interest in Mississippi than in any other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.026" offset="6863910">Mississippi is one of the few states that does not have an intermediate Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1695.469" offset="6921693">Justice Blackmun, that is entirely correct, and I am not suggesting Mississippi cannot get along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.357" offset="6937262">It is getting along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.523" offset="6941964">But in addition to not having an intermediate Court of Appeals, Mississippi has chosen to allow all litigants an automatic right of appeal directly from Mississippi's 40 trial courts to the Mississippi Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.716" offset="7010718">Well, Your Honor, it may be routine, but I do not think it is routine in most states for there to be the backlog of appeals there is in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.804" offset="7043005">In Mississippi, the average time in cases receiving plenary review between appeal and disposition is about four years, as it was in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.910" offset="7079472">Mississippi wanted to address that chronic backlog problem, and discourage appeals, but not prevent them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.100" offset="7108207">Now, the Equal Protection Clause does not require a perfect fit between means and objectives, but given the Legislature's objectives in this case, there is actually a very close fit between this statute and the desire to preserve judicial resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.026" offset="7167975">The Legislature wanted a statute that would be as self-executing and administratively simple as possible, so that already overworked judges would not have to spend additional time holding individualized hearings to determine whether there should be a penalty, and if so, how much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.487" offset="7245820">And the Legislature wanted to provide an appropriate level of deterrence by providing a penalty that would be proportional to the judgment at issue and which could be known in advance, so the prospective Appellant would be able mathematically to calculate the penalty and weigh the penalty when deciding whether the strength of his or her appeal justified the penalty that would be imposed if unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.506" offset="7357833">Given those objectives, it was certainly rational to limit the appeal penalty to cases involving money judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.696" offset="7390643">That, for example, explains why the penalty does not apply to plaintiffs who seek money judgments but recover nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.016" offset="7419900">Applying a penalty in that circumstance would require the Mississippi Supreme Court to hold an individualized hearing and make an ultimately subjective judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2015.843" offset="8203156">We have shown, however, why it is that the statute is limited to appeals from money judgments, and those statutory classifications are not arbitrary and they are certainly not designed to harm any suspect group or politically powerless minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.770" offset="8262924">Furthermore, under the Equal Protection Clause, statutes can be very under-inclusive and still be constitutional, because states are permitted so long as their statutes do rationally further a legitimate interest, to proceed one step at a time, addressing broad social problems, step by step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.016" offset="8335858">In fact, in the very case that Bankers Life relies upon, Lindsey v. Normet, this case upheld a statute that was very under-inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.206" offset="8376609">It upheld special litigation burdens on only one class of defendants who happened to be tenants in eviction proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.895" offset="8415374">In the McRae case, which we did not cite, 291 U.S. 566, this Court actually even upheld statutes that singled out insurance company defendants in suits brought by policyholders for special litigation burdens that were not faced by any other litigants, including imposition of attorneys' fees at trial and appeal, and a 12 percent penalty if they lost the suit by the policyholder, even if their defense was in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.116" offset="8536269">The Court did not find that that was an under-inclusive or irrational classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.585" offset="8558212">And in the Ortwein case, which we cited, the Court even upheld appellate filing fees that absolutely barred appeal by indigent plaintiffs, even though other classes of litigants were permitted to appeal in forma pauperis, as the appellants in Ortwein were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.630" offset="8626339">That statute was not considered under-inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.815" offset="8635116">It is true that in the Lindsey case, this Court did strike down the double bond provision of the Oregon statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.885" offset="8659358">But that double bond statute was not struck down because it was under-inclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2142.710" offset="8710663">In that case, the state interests were to guarantee recovery of rent if appeal by an tenant was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.232" offset="8744726">Rent, of course, is easily measurable and calculable, unlike the intangible costs on appeal we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.238" offset="8772834">And the purpose of that statute was not just to discourage all marginal appeals as in Mississippi, but to quote "prevent frivolous appeals".</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.045" offset="8820063">That statute obviously did not prevent frivolous appeals, because tenants who had frivolous appeals, if they could post the bond, could appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.283" offset="8849007">There are other important distinctions between Lindsey and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.568" offset="8862068">The double bond statute there had to be paid before appeal, so it actually did prevent appeals by indigent parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.174" offset="8900520">In Mississippi, this penalty does not prevent appeal by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.495" offset="8917866">It only comes into play after the appeal is unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.297" offset="8933017">I will turn now, if I may, to a discussion of Bankers Life's challenges to the punitive damage awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.303" offset="8969066">I want to stress as categorically and clearly as I can that not one of the Federal challenges to the punitive damage award that Bankers Life has argued here was presented to the Mississippi Supreme Court, even in the Petition for Rehearing after the affirmance of the underlying case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.768" offset="9058927">Accordingly, based on a long line of cases, which we cited in Footnote 36 of our Brief, this Court this not have jurisdiction to hear those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.857" offset="9095289">Furthermore, those are not appeal questions, they are cert. questions, and therefore, even if the Court had the power to hear those questions, in the exercise of its discretion, it should decline to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.181" offset="9144609">They are, of course, extraordinarily important questions, which, if Bankers Life's position is accepted, would fundamentally change the nature of Federal-state relations and would require states very substantially to modify both their tort law systems and their criminal law systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.209" offset="9212631">The Court should not, in my opinion, reach out to decide those questions until a case properly raising them is before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2380.132" offset="9660370">One is that it was not presented in the trial courts of the state, and under state law, if an issue is not presented in the trial courts, the state supreme court won't hear it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2394.476" offset="9717735">Our point is that even in the Petition for Rehearing, the issue was not presented, ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.880" offset="9747306">For example, let us take the Excessive Fines Clause issue, which is the most important one they are pressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.617" offset="9770294">They have radically changed their position on the presentation of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.603" offset="9794222">In their jurisdictional statement, they admitted that the Excessive Fines Clause question was not presented even in the Petition for Rehearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3320.429" offset="13421585">And that is what you are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.131" offset="13428377">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.814" offset="13435064">My position is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.249" offset="13440811">Bankers Life is arguing that the sole benchmark for determining the excessiveness of an award ought to be the legislative judgment of what is appropriate in the criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.141" offset="13484383">Of course, that ignores the fact that the fine in the criminal sanction is only a very small component of the total criminal sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.811" offset="13515103">It admits, for example, incarceration and loss of business license and other penalties like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.381" offset="13541330">I think that the fair way to look at this is that legislatures know about what is going on out there in tort awards and punitive damage awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.220" offset="13572677">Some legislatures have adopted caps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.256" offset="13580827">Others have chosen not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.506" offset="13585843">The Mississippi legislature has squarely chosen not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.791" offset="13599009">Is there a statute that says they have chosen not to?</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.945" offset="13623564">Can a legislature choose something by not enacting a statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.599" offset="13638192">There was a bill pushed by the insurance industry in the 1986 legislative session, which got out of committee, went to the floor of the Mississippi Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.253" offset="13668808">It would have capped punitive damage awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.372" offset="13677271">That bill was defeated by vote of the Mississippi Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.574" offset="13690124">I think that reflects a legislative judgment not to cap punitive damage awards in Mississippi, for the very good reason that a punitive damage... I'm sorry.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="3404.535" offset="13757938">I will be brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.237" offset="13772775">With respect first of all to the appeal penalty, this Court squarely held in Lindsey v. Normet that access to the appellate courts cannot be denied or barriers imposed that are over-inclusive, or over-broad or under-inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.663" offset="13826483">This statute is all of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.297" offset="13833066">It does not merely punish frivolous appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.699" offset="13846649">This was not a frivolous appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.317" offset="13853128">This was a case that took the Mississippi Supreme Court four years to handle and decided on a five to four basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.304" offset="13877056">It could not be construed as a frivolous appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.439" offset="13885624">Yet, the punishment was to apply here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3438.856" offset="13895237">Are you suggesting that it was deliberating all of those four years?</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="3442.676" offset="13910493">I have no way of knowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.445" offset="13921569">It had four years within which to deliberate it, to deliberate the issue, and from the Opinions written, it does suggest that considerable time and debate was spent on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.801" offset="13963051">It was a close question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.634" offset="13966395">It certainly wasn't a frivolous appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.186" offset="13972560">The Mississippi statute seems to me to suggest a statute which I read about in preparing for this argument that existed under Edward I in England, which is described by Pollock and Maitland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.660" offset="14022506">In that statute, under Edward I, if an appeal was rejected, the appellant was to be imprisoned for year and had to pay a penalty in the form of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.535" offset="14062003">According to Pollock and Maitland, this statute is a typical piece of medieval legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.503" offset="14081856">It desires to punish malicious appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.189" offset="14092618">It actually punishes every appeal which ends in affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.974" offset="14107769">That is exactly like the Mississippi appeal penalty statute, and, as Pollock and Maitland said, a very good example of medieval legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.413" offset="14137445">With respect to whether the issues were raised in a timely fashion and brought to this Court in such a fashion that this Court has jurisdiction, we have not hesitated to address the fact that the issues were not raised in an elegant or sophisticated or detailed fashion in the Mississippi Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.141" offset="14208393">But they were raised in a way which is consistent with the decisions of this Court, particularly the Webb's Fabulous Pharmacy v. Beckwith case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.230" offset="14244756">As has been pointed out in the oral argument, the Excessive Fines Clause was expressly referred to, this penalty was referred to as an Excessive Fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.086" offset="14284148">The Court should not deny jurisdiction because the phrase "Excessive Fines Clause" was not used when the words "excessive fines" were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.042" offset="14319988">With respect to the due process objection, my opponent has made the point that this is not criminal penalty and it is a civil penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.849" offset="14367218">I refer back to the Giacco v. Pennsylvania case which I referred to during the earlier part of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.320" offset="14389160">That issue was specifically raised in that case in a $230.00 for so-called reprehensible conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.343" offset="14417164">It was after the individual was acquitted and the state made the argument, this isn't a criminal penalty, it's just like costs in a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.913" offset="14443495">This Court held, and I think it was unanimous, I'm not sure, that you cannot fine someone $230.00 because they have been found by a jury to have acted reprehensibly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.786" offset="14482992">That decision is dispositive, it seems to me, with respect to the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.607" offset="14506294">Seventeen years ago, this Court struck down as unconstitutional a practice which dated back to medieval England, was practiced by virtually every state and the Federal Government, had been repeatedly implicitly approved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.349" offset="14565226">As the Court then said in Williams v. Illinois, striking down incarceration for non-payment of fines, neither the antiquity of a practice nor the legislative and judicial endorsement of it provides insulation from constitutional scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.859" offset="14627293">The punitive damage awards should be recognized for what they are... governmentally-imposed penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.215" offset="14656654">When they are excessive, they are unconstitutional.</text>
