            <text syncTime="11.062" offset="173841">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.024" offset="193694">What this case is is simply the Norris non-retroactive liability holding revisited five years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.575" offset="255866">And this case deals solely with the relief aspect of Norris.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.608" offset="280003">It does not deal with the Norris liability holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.583" offset="303931">In this regard, our contention is that what this Court said about remedies in Norris, i.e., that pension plans would not be liable under Title VII for the payment of benefits attributable to pre-August 1, 1983 contributions, even though such benefits were calculated using sex distinct mortality tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.874" offset="441126">That what this Court said in Norris bars the award of relief herein because respondents before this Court are all pre-August 1, 1983 retirees whose benefits are therefore completely attributable to pre-August 1, 1983 contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.749" offset="532555">In short, we are not proposing that a new rule of law be laid down in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.894" offset="561185">Rather, we are simply asking that the Norris relief rule be most emphatically underscored herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.400" offset="603190">That prior to August 1, 1983, there will be no liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.836" offset="632969">But that subsequent to August 1, 1983, there will be and is liability if sex distinct mortality tables continue in the use of benefit calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.135" offset="690125">By way of a brief road map to my argument, I intend principally, and possibly exclusively, to address this Norris non-retroactive, this Norris relief issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.113" offset="746027">I do not intend to cover the first and second alternative arguments in our Brief for Petitioners unless of course the Court has any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.380" offset="791062">Those arguments deal with, respectively, whether in any event Manhart and Norris bar the award of relief to the pre-Manhart retirees in this case, and whether proration, at least under an accrued benefit methodology should have been applied to the award of relief to the post-Manhart retirees herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.986" offset="885521">If there remains time, I may briefly address our third alternative argument on the Title VII exhaustion and class scope limitation issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.463" offset="931392">Mr. Collette, as a preliminary matter, would you explain to me the mechanics of the plan that led to males receiving lower monthly benefits than females?</text>
            <text syncTime="212.591" offset="979980">Normally, the application of a sex-based table would not yield that result.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles T. Collette</label>
            <text syncTime="218.275" offset="1002654">Your Honor, it is the result of the mechanics of a defined benefit pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.950" offset="1037345">The primary benefit under a defined benefit plan, such as the FRS, is calculated pursuant to a formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.079" offset="1081858">That produces an equal monthly retirement benefit for similarly situated males and females.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.975" offset="1109443">When you go to joint annuitant options, then mortality tables are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.929" offset="1141312">And to reduce the future expected single life benefit to a present dollar value, when sex distinct tables were used prior to August 1, 1983, the woman of course had a greater primary single life value because she was expected to live longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.354" offset="1223023">Therefore, when you went to a joint annuitant option, it resulted in her receiving a greater monthly benefit in her joint annuitant than a similarly situated male and his joint annuitant.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.784" offset="1268685">There's a good brief explanation in the 1983 Law Review article by Hager and Zempleman, and also in the Department of Labor's 1983 Cost Study.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.163" offset="1314243">The basic facts with respect to this central issue are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.478" offset="1339529">The FRS, as I mentioned, is a defined benefit pension plan with over 1100 plus Florida local governmental employers participating there.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.404" offset="1387177">It is a relatively new or youthful pension plan created in 1970 out of the amalgamation of several earlier Florida retirement plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.904" offset="1433257">From its inception in 1970 to present, it has always collected equal contributions from or on behalf of similarly situated males and females.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.130" offset="1482158">From its inception in 1970 to present and as mentioned, it has always paid the same primary monthly retirement benefit to similarly situated males and females.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.640" offset="1528133">From its inception in 1970 to present, in addition to its primary life benefit and as mentioned, it has had three joint annuitant benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.917" offset="1573273">Prior to August 1, 1983, the FRS calculated benefits thereunder which resulted in males and their joint annuitants, in response to your question, receiving a lesser monthly joint annuitant benefit than similarly situated males and females.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.487" offset="1647565">However, effective August 1, 1983, and because of this Court's Norris decision, the FRS converted to unisex mortality tables for the calculation of its three joint annuitant benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.388" offset="1711095">And this has resulted in similarly situated males and females retiring since that time receiving the same monthly retirement benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.025" offset="1749652">It should also be noted that all retirees under the FRS obtain a vested contractual right to the full amount of their retirement benefits which vested contractual right arises as of the effective date of retirement and which vested contractual right prevents the State from thereafter ever subsequently reducing that retiree's benefits.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles T. Collette</label>
            <text syncTime="472.191" offset="2018400">I think it is also important to remember that there is no question that the award in this case were it to be implemented, will be paid by the FRS for its 1100 plus FRS participating Florida Governmental employers through increased contribution rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.746" offset="2100529">In short, as of January 1983, the FRS was in exactly the same situation as 45 percent of defined benefit and 74 percent of defined contribution plans in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.520" offset="2187673">Which plans, as the Department of Labor pointed out in its 1983 cost study, had not yet as of such date converted to unisex mortality tables for benefit calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.357" offset="2243053">Moreover, and when Norris came down, Florida promptly complied therewith as mentioned by converting to unisex tables for its benefit calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.616" offset="2288088">On these facts, the District Court, disagreeing with the Ninth Circuit's decision in Probe v. State Teachers' Retirement System, awarded relief totalling approximately $43.6 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.797" offset="2360813">The Eleventh Circuit, likewise disagreeing with the Ninth Circuit's Probe decision, affirmed this award of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.022" offset="2389652">In essence, what this case boils down to is simply whether Norris bars the award of retroactive relief in the form of both prospective and retrospective adjustment of pension benefits to pre-August 1, 1983 retirees under a State operated defined benefit pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.400" offset="2495186">The Eleventh Circuit held, and plaintiffs argue, that Norris is a narrow decision limited on its facts to the Manhart open market exception and third party insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.570" offset="2563836">That Norris has no applicability to the FRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.273" offset="2586720">In this regard, they argue that since the State of Florida administers the FRS, there is no third party issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.731" offset="2632486">That, however, overlooks that with respect to over half of its retirees, the State, through the FRS, is a third-party insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.480" offset="2691523">Specifically, over half the retirees of the FRS are employees of Florida local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.307" offset="2722870">And in this situation, the State and its FRS is in essence the same as a third party insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.732" offset="2756515">It is in essence in the same situation as the TIAA pref plan at issue in Spirt, and it is essence in the same position as the private insurance companies at issue in Norris.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.623" offset="2812104">Plaintiffs, as said, argue Norris has no applicability and that Manhart clearly put pension plans such as the FRS on notice that it could not use sex distinct tables to calculate monthly benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.004" offset="2881590">However, and as Hager and Zempleman pointed out in their 1983 Drake Law Review article, Manhart created confusion and uncertainty in the pension industry as to whether sex distinct mortality tables could continue to be used in benefit calculations.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.140" offset="2978138">And this confusion and uncertainty was only finally resolved by this Court's Norris decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.085" offset="3009903">Indeed it was only until this Court's Norris decision that the issue of whether it was proper to do anything other than to top all the way up, in this situation top the male benefits up to the female benefits, only Norris settled that you could use unisex topping up.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.579" offset="3095898">In fact, the lower court in Norris used the full topping up to the opposite sex's rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.472" offset="3123484">The Manhart open market exception meant something entirely different to pension plan administrators in the time before Norris than that which it is argued it now here means today.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.539" offset="3215748">In short, and without the benefit of the lens provided by Norris employed by the Eleventh Circuit in its analysis, and by plaintiffs in their argument, the Manhart open market exception in the period before Norris seemed to permit the calculation of benefits using sex distinct mortality tables, especially optional joint annuitant benefits in a defined benefit plan such as the FRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.965" offset="3365482">For the use of such tables resulted in the largest benefit a retiree's... and I quote Manhart... "accumulated contributions could command".</text>
            <text syncTime="821.914" offset="3417204">And I emphasize, command.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.845" offset="3424937">Not purchase, could command on the open market.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.178" offset="3438311">Judge Poole, writing for the Ninth Circuit in Probe certainly found such was the case when he held that the California State Teachers' Retirement System... and again I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="840.738" offset="3492542">"reasonably could have assumed that it was lawful to provide an optional annuity system that reflected plans offered by insurance companies on the open market. "</text>
            <text syncTime="856.208" offset="3554400">Moreover, the facts belie that the pension industry viewed Manhart as requiring a wholesale conversion to unisex tables for benefit calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.966" offset="3609466">For one thing, the publications of the National Actuarial firms in the period after Manhart stated to the effect that Manhart created more problems than it resolved, and that the pension industry should take a wait and see position.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.620" offset="3692117">For another thing, and as previously mentioned, as of January 1983, 45 percent of defined benefit and 74 percent of defined contribution plans in this country had not yet converted to sex neutral tables for benefit calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.601" offset="3767977">In any event, Norris was not a narrow decision limited on its facts solely to the issue of the Manhart open market exception and third party insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.113" offset="3834014">Rather, it is manifestly clear that the Norris non-retroactive liability holding was meant to apply to all pension plans throughout this country including the FRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.753" offset="3900574">In other words, it is manifestly clear that in Norris this Court intended to wipe the slate clean as of August 1, 1983, for all pension plans in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.894" offset="3957208">That prior to that line, there would be no liability if sex distinct mortality tables had been used in benefit calculation, but that subsequent to August 1, 1983, there would be liability if such tables continued in benefit calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.605" offset="4032022">The primary concern for the Norris non-retroactive majority's denial of retroactive relief was its concern with the impact a retroactive holding could have on pension plans throughout this country, both private and public.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.019" offset="4113629">And that concern was not misplaced, given the percentages of plans which the Department of Labor found in its cost study had not, as of January '83, yet converted to sex neutral tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.188" offset="4174338">Moreover, I think the fact that this Court took a highly unusual action in Norris by delaying its judgment three weeks underscores that the Norris decision was intended to apply to all pension plans throughout this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.844" offset="4260960">Since there was no reason to provide a grace period for the Arizona plan at issue in Norris because by the time that plan reached this Court, its objected to provisions had been eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.781" offset="4308711">The key is that that grace period was effectively utilized by the FRS in this case to convert to unisex mortality tables for the calculation of its future retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.701" offset="4360434">That grace period was also effectively utilized by the New York State Teachers' Retirement System in Hannahs v. New York State Teachers' Retirement System and no doubt that grace period was effectively utilized by thousands of pension plans throughout this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.365" offset="4443085">In short, Norris announced a broad rule of relief founded on policy and clearly intended to prevent a regime of discretion which rule is applicable to all pension plans throughout this country, both defined benefit and defined contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.196" offset="4566383">Which rule allows those plans and says those plans could continue to pay their retirement benefits to pre-August 1, 1983 retirees even though those benefits had been calculated using sex distinct mortality tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.681" offset="4644333">Because of this, and because respondents before this Court, i.e., plaintiffs and the plaintiff class, are all pre-August 1, 1983 retirees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.447" offset="6459425">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.663" offset="6488264">With your permission, I will depart from the intended structure to comment on three features of my opponent's argument that will perhaps contribute to an understanding of the problem we are here to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.023" offset="6549704">First, Justice O'Connor inquired about the apparent anomaly that it is the male here who has brought the claim and who is receiving the lower benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.902" offset="6601218">That can be simply explained perhaps by pointing out that the familiar phenomenon of an assumed longer life expectancy for the female which would require in typical circumstances that a fixed amount of benefit be extended over a longer assumed life time is precisely the same type of impact that produces the illegal result here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.940" offset="6709364">It's a bit disguised for the simple reason that it arose in this case as a consequence of the choice made by the men to elect a spousal protection option under which not the single lifetime of the retired employee is considered but the combined lifetimes of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.125" offset="6790135">As a consequence of that, for instance... and you can just work this out with a piece of paper should you care to, and I'll assume figures to make it simple... if you assume a 65 year old male retires and his life expectancy is 70, then that person has a five-year life assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.716" offset="6860457">But if he's designating the protection of a slightly younger female age 60, who would have a 75-year life expectancy, her life expectancy is some additional 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.894" offset="6905178">The system simply looks at the longer of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.475" offset="6915523">Of course, it doesn't add them, just looks at the longer of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.576" offset="6927853">That's a 15 year payout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.619" offset="6936107">If you reverse that and you assume that you have a 65 year old retiring female who, with a 75 year life expectancy expects to live ten more years, and you add to that picture the identical other facts, i.e., that she designates the protection of a male spouse and give the male spouse the same age, 60, with his lower life expectancy of 70, he's expected to live ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.055" offset="7037776">Both the male and the female are expected to live ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.278" offset="7050733">Those are comparable, identically comparable opposite relationships between the male and the female retiring employee, but because of the 15 year payout that's assumed for the life expectancy that's extended by reason of sex, there results the familiar downgrading of the pension benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.110" offset="7130040">It is disguised in that it takes place in the male paycheck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.614" offset="7148013">The members of this class are not exclusively males.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.666" offset="7160238">They are males and they are also the surviving joint annuitants of the males so in many instances, we have widows who are participating in this class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.361" offset="7199004">If I may mention another thing that has come up in the argument that I think requires some clarification, counsel has placed some considerable emphasis and twice cited to this Court, a statistic by which he advises you that I think some 45 percent of the pension plans in this country are defined benefit plans that as of 1983 when you decided the Norris case had not yet converted to unisex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.412" offset="7315196">He doesn't also advise this Court, so I shall, that he's using a statistic which by his own admission doesn't discriminate between employer operated plans and employer sponsored plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.162" offset="7374233">So he's citing it to you to infer that throughout this country, even after Manhart, there were a huge number of defined benefit plans employer operated, we must assume if it's to be relevant to our case, which did not make the switch to unisex until 1983, inferring to you the enormity of a national impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.868" offset="7469110">But the statistic on which he relies specifically says that there has been no attempt to distinguish between an employer operated plan and an employer sponsored plan in developing that statistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.668" offset="7516235">And I invite you to look at the 33rd page of the State's brief, footnote 27, where they explain that in detail, stating, and I quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.736" offset="7548522">"We'd quickly reveal that it covers all state, local government and private defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans with no distinction as to whether employer operated or employer sponsored. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.972" offset="7601498">So the inference urged by counsel is not supported by the statistic on which he relies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.896" offset="7625218">Counsel has also made an argument in his oral presentation to the Court that's not in the briefs and has never been made before in any of the earlier judicial proceedings affecting Florida v. Long.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.997" offset="7681538">He says to us today for the first time that the State of Florida occupies a position analogous to that of a third party insurer because after all the State of Florida is an umbrella or parent governmental unit having enormous sub-tiers of other governmental units within the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.101" offset="7761995">Clearly, this is something that's occurred to counsel just recently in preparing his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.767" offset="7788640">I would remind him, and I respectfully point out to this Court that a stipulation that they entered into, which appears in the Appendix, page 36, completely belies any argument that would be predicated upon it, and it's unfortunate that he has made that argument to you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.720" offset="7856453">Stipulation No. 4, and I'm reading from the 39th page of the Appendix, expressly says the following:</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.793" offset="7884770">"The State of Florida for the purposes of Title VII is the employer of the members of the plaintiffs' class, and is authorized and charged under Florida statutes with the duty and responsibility of lawfully administering the FRS. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.033" offset="7945688">"No third party unrelated to the State of Florida is authorized to or does administer the FRS. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.520" offset="7975676">So counsel's argument, while it may have some appeal to him, has been placed to rest deep in--</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.444" offset="8307327">A rule of amnesty that said that a pardon is given with respect to Title VII violations through the use of a sex based mortality table for all kinds of plans, even those plans that had five years before that been the subject of an earlier ruling of this Court in Manhart.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.447" offset="8839389">I would suggest to this Court that that type of problem is not unlike two of the other questions that were raised in Norris, decided in Norris, and yet were not thought to be such a new and unforeseeable resolution of a rule of law as would have invoked concerns about retroactivity or would have led to discussions of proration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.128" offset="8926115">In the Norris decision, the Court looked backward at Manhart and found that there were two other questions in Manhart that had not been addressed and answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.111" offset="8990063">Manhart of course dealt with the inequality in the required contributions in the pension system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.137" offset="9014096">It did not deal, as we do here, and as Norris did in 1983, with discrimination at the payout stage in the monthly benefit check.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.402" offset="9051190">Nor did it deal specifically with the question of whether an otherwise liable employer for a violation of the Act could justify the practice by offering a non-discriminatory option in combination with the discriminatory option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.783" offset="9120675">When we read Manhart, we don't find answers to those questions either, necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.639" offset="9144186">But when those questions were addressed five years later in Norris, this Court disposed of them without struggling over those questions as it did struggle and split on the question of whether to extend the liability on an employer operated plan to the employer sponsored plan, which were the facts before it in Norris.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.532" offset="9231748">The Court said with respect to the issue of discrimination in the pay-in contribution stage versus discrimination in the payout stage,</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.195" offset="9262364">"we have no hesitation at holding, as have all but one of the other lower Courts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.371" offset="9283053">and it went on to say that that type of new question could be answered rather forthrightly in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.555" offset="9307817">It was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.154" offset="9310220">Similarly, the Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.057" offset="9317848">"it is likewise irrelevant that the Arizona plan includes two options. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.007" offset="9333626">And went ahead to dispose of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.320" offset="9342821">If this is a question which the Court would address, I think it would address it and come to the conclusion that liability still attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.965" offset="9373436">And I would suggest that if that is the consideration that this body undertakes that when it reaches the conclusion, which I would submit should be that liability still attaches, that this Court will not conclude that it has announced a new and unforeseeable rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.156" offset="9438220">Consequently, this Court would not conclude that to impose that conclusion upon the State of Florida at this time would lead to non-retroactivity considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.552" offset="9479807">Now, if I may, what's being argued here essentially is a per se rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.742" offset="9532574">The State employer contends that there is a per se rule of defense beginning in 1983 as to which all prior possible liabilities for a Title VII pension violation are excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.142" offset="9602164">We submit to the Court that that approach to the problem is not workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.307" offset="9634870">That essentially is the outlook taken by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.380" offset="9647095">And where there are conflicts between the Ninth and the Eleventh, it is largely in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.545" offset="9667784">The primary distinction between what occurred as our case came up through the court system and out of the Eleventh Circuit versus what took place in the Ninth Circuit is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.192" offset="9706341">The Ninth read Norris, and we say misread Norris, to establish a per se rule of defense for all pension cases regardless of the type of fund that was involved, regardless of how much money the pension fund might have, regardless of whether the pension fund had an excess cash surplus, regardless of whether it was a defined benefit plan or defined contribution plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.259" offset="9810622">In other words, a blanket rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.779" offset="9824728">We submit to the Court that the imposition of a blanket rule is often an inappropriate way to get to the best judicial result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.968" offset="9869449">What occurred in this case was quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.651" offset="9880212">In this case, without the imposition of any blanket rule, the trial judge undertook to hear this case on its facts, and to let the State undertake to prove, if they could, what they now argue they have the right to assert to you as a a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.599" offset="9943951">He put them to the proof of it as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.963" offset="9961400">When he put them to the proof of it as a matter of fact, they failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.596" offset="9983970">I submit to you that in looking in broad terms at which is the better result, that of the Eleventh or that of the Ninth, we should come to the conclusion that the benefit of taking the approach suggested by the Eleventh Circuit is simply that it does permit a case by case individual pension plan by pension plan analysis of impact, of the arguments in support of proration, and any other matter which may on behalf of an employer constitute a basis for an alleged defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.498" offset="10123569">And it lets those defense occupy the posture of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2538.739" offset="10284587">And then in Norris, the Court dealt with one of the very important aspects of that case which differ from ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.704" offset="10308411">The Norris case was a defined contribution plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.326" offset="10322935">There are some clear implications of that type of plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.929" offset="10337355">And if we view Norris as a per se rule of law applying to a defined contribution plan, it does no violence to the judgment that you have before you in Florida v. Long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.266" offset="10382703">And it would seem to make good policy, because there are characteristics of a defined contribution plan which make it highly sensitive to being impacted by subsequent impositions of liability through changes of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.489" offset="10583533">They offered some evidence... not unlike the statistic on which they relied a few minutes ago twice in their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.104" offset="10614044">In fact, that was some of the evidence, I believe, that was precluded below, and they continued to cite it because the Court would have the authority to notice it judicially whether it was stamped in evidence below or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.642" offset="10656153">And they are simply saying that there ought to be a kind of national concern on how many other possible plans generically similar to this one might be impacted by an outcome in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.303" offset="10714772">I think that that's a wrong approach in that it, for instance, it overlooks the inferences that this Court in 1976 in the Bowman case put upon the fact that Title VII guarantees no claimant damages, guarantees no claimant any particular outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.415" offset="10787288">It grants to the Federal trial judge, the discretion to fashion such relief as the circumstances may require, and within his discretion, that might be merely declaratory, merely injunctive in certain respects.</text>

            <text syncTime="2708.085" offset="10961890">Remember the difference between the Eleventh and the Ninth is that the Ninth reads Norris as giving a rule of law about the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.329" offset="10990938">The trial judge in the Eleventh Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit itself took the approach that there is no absolute rule but that there are these defenses of which you can avail yourself if you can prove the adequate facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.749" offset="11044542">These people were unable to prove those adequate facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.242" offset="11058543">The first thing that we put in proof below, which I think was especially convincing, was a memorandum written by the State Retirement Actuary two years before you decided the Manhart case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.828" offset="11104937">And in that memorandum, it's an absolutely prophetic memorandum written by the State Retirement Actuary, it's a statutory position in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.006" offset="11137642">His job is what it sounds like it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.528" offset="11143702">And he wrote it to his boss, the Pension Administrator of the State of Florida that he had attended a seminar about unisex tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.982" offset="11173482">And he came back from that seminar convinced that an employer operated pension plan, such as the one that was in Florida, could not lawfully use sex based mortality tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.791" offset="11224786">And since he didn't think so, he recommended that before the year 1977 began that they abolish them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.895" offset="11257178">And in that memorandum, he said, just briefly, that there was a general thrust taken by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by which their... and I'm quoting...</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.371" offset="11339098">"now is a very strong possibility that actuaries will no longer be permitted to use mortality standards which provide for the use of differentiation in the rate of mortality by sex. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.938" offset="11381312">And I think it's interesting because when Manhart came up about 24 months later, this Court divided on the liability questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.575" offset="11419869">And some of the Justices in the minority on liability expressed some concerns about the validity of unisex actuarial tables, the availability of them to various employers, the general practicality of proceeding to require the use of unisex tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.465" offset="11475458">In the facts of the Florida case, it's clear that those expressed concerns were not a problem for the Florida facts and this State Retirement Actuary explains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.094" offset="11530001">The use of mortality rates on a single unisex basis has been found quite practical for non-insured plans which have been shifting over to the use of approximate benefit factors anyway and thus getting away from the type of precise actuarial equivalent for early retirement and optional benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.446" offset="11603353">He went on to explain exactly what the probable illegality of the plan would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.010" offset="11625609">That the EEOC is concerned that when actuarial tables are sex segregated, this frequently results in the payment of different periodic pension benefits to males and females under the guise of actuarial equivalence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.649" offset="11676182">He specifically said, this will violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2900.791" offset="11732711">"in light of the strong possibility of the Federal Government mandating the use of such tables, I would recommend that we resolve this difference once and for all. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.085" offset="11765939">Now, that was two years before you wrote a word in Manhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.397" offset="11779209">When the Manhart decision came down... and I might add the evidence was that he got no reply to that memo... when the Manhart decision came down, he wrote another memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.627" offset="11840127">This one is dated May 19, 1978, and it was very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.071" offset="11857890">He said, I am attaching some option factors that we can use to straighten out the sex based tables in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.169" offset="11898223">And now, I'm quoting, he says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.109" offset="11906060">"this analysis will serve as a guide to developing a unisex table for option reduction factors. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.814" offset="11932809">"In light of the recent Supreme Court decision, it is not a question of, if, but when we adopt such factors. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.560" offset="11967813">The State of Florida was never puzzled about what Manhart meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.502" offset="11987562">The State of Florida at that time was not struggling with payout versus pay-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.256" offset="12010654">Was not struggling with the question of having a non-discriminatory option benefit combined in a package with discriminatory benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.072" offset="12045867">The State Retirement Actuary simply said, it is not a question of, if, but when we adopt such factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.288" offset="12082752">What happened in Florida was a tragedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.229" offset="12094455">The policy makers didn't agree with the pension administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.962" offset="12113472">Now, as we view the State of Florida in its context here as an employer, the State Government is in a role analogous to any other employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.080" offset="12161955">Its legislature makes its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.264" offset="12170628">What did the Florida legislature do on the statement of the Manhart case in 1978?</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.229" offset="12206468">In 1979, the Florida legislature passed an anti-Manhart Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.133" offset="12230083">Florida Statute 112.66, subsection 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.157" offset="12254220">In their wisdom, they passed an Act that said first of all, the good part, no Florida Government pension plan shall discriminate in its benefit formula based on color, national origin, sex or marital status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.663" offset="12304271">And then here comes the hooker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.215" offset="12310435">Nothing here shall preclude a plan from actuarially adjusting benefits or offering options based on sex, age, early retirement or disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.602" offset="12352022">So their reaction to Manhart in 1978 was to pass a piece of local policy in 1979 that is in effect an anti-Manhart Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.029" offset="12393714">So the State Actuary warned them two years before you ruled that this was going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.054" offset="12413776">When you did rule in Manhart, he says, looked it has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.995" offset="12425583">It's no longer a question of, if; it's a question of when.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.248" offset="12438540">The reaction of the legislature was to say, oh, no, we'll just pass a law about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.781" offset="12456721">And they made a statement of policy that says, we're going to continue to make sex based discriminatory differences in pension payments, notwithstanding the fact that Florida was an employer operated defined benefit plan, just like Manhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.502" offset="12515549">So under those facts, those defendants knew that the plan was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.385" offset="12539164">There is also a clear statement of proof as to what the motivation was when Florida refused to make the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.792" offset="12580751">And since there's a comment about this in the Eleventh Circuit opinion, they suggested that this finding of fact was a conclusion of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.937" offset="12617322">Because the Court in a conclusion of law section discusses this at some considerable length, I'd like to clear that up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.063" offset="12645848">In disputed finding of fact number ten, appearing in the Appendix at page 60, Judge Stafford, the Trial Court Judge in this case, said, and I am quoting, as a finding of fact, before he got to his conclusions and he built on this in his conclusions, but as a fact finding, he said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.385" offset="12719095">"on rebuttal, Mr. McMillian... who was a State Retirement Director who wouldn't answer those memos... identified the reason for not developing the no cost unisex approach before 1983. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.623" offset="12768101">That's referred to as a no cost unisex approach because if they had made that switch in 1978 when they knew they should have, you simply adopt a unisex table which is an averaged result of the higher male rate and the lower female rate or the reverse of that if you apply it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.035" offset="12833720">Anyway, it's an aggregation of the two and since you're dealing with nonvested rights, you simply reduce one class and increase the second class, and you strike a unisex level of benefit for both sexes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.972" offset="12885443">And they're talking about that as a no-cost approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.456" offset="12895369">And they said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.155" offset="12898191">"Mr. McMillian identified the reason for not developing a no-cost unisex approach before 1983. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.058" offset="12921805">"That reason was because the no cost approach would result in a reduction of benefits to over one-half of the membership, i.e., women. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.915" offset="12953257">"Those in charge did not want to take that step unless they had to. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.968" offset="12973423">The Court then went on to say, in its conclusions,</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.180" offset="12986275">"the State simply did not want to make the politically unpopular decision to reduce female benefits. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.126" offset="13010099">"The State chose to maintain the discriminatory status quo. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.596" offset="13023996">The key to it in my view is that the superior thing about the Eleventh Circuit conclusion has to do with the procedures used in arriving at that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.985" offset="13081570">It did not follow a per se rule of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.009" offset="13097662">It did not grant to this employer an absolute irrevocable assumption that its plan is just like the most sensitive of plans, or that its plan was just like the Norris plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.527" offset="13143742">The trial judge quite correctly, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed him for doing it, permitted a trial on the facts about those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.271" offset="13170700">Whereas in the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit overruled the trial judge as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.447" offset="13191389">I would point out parenthetically that in my reading of those Ninth Circuit cases, I do notice that they were all summarily adjudicated below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.662" offset="13224199">And while we are critiquing such things, it might be well to say that it would have perhaps been better for the Ninth Circuit at the trial level to have had a full trial, rather than to have undertaken to summarily adjudicate some of those questions.</text>
