            <text syncTime="33.548" offset="237589">I think that I can best be helpful to the Court at the outset by reviewing in a cursory way the factual background against which the legal issues holds here are raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.364" offset="704867">He was identified by Hom Way as the source of his heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.570" offset="729631">The name given was “Blackie Toy” and it was stated by Hom Way that he operated a laundry on Leavenworth Street and forthwith a posse was formed, a posse of seven agents from the Federal Narcotics Bureau who immediately went to Leavenworth Street in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.254" offset="812387">And they stopped at a laundry known as “Oye's Laundry”, O-Y-E-S Laundry.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.700" offset="850213">Now, Hom Way, if the Court please, had never before, as the record shows, given information to federal narcotics authorities and so his reliability was wholly untested.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.503" offset="921370">The agents went to Leavenworth Street without a warrant, search or arrest.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="314.315" offset="1360645">I -- the record is not completely consistent on that Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.392" offset="1388962">But the fact of the matter is that it is clear that petitioner James Wah Toy regarded the incident as closed that the time he told him that the laundry did not open until 8 a.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.356" offset="1444760">And it was at that juncture that Agent Wong flashed the badge of authority and petitioner James Wah Toy slammed the door closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.063" offset="1491675">At this point, the record shows giving it the most favorable inference to the Government that petitioner Toy ran back through the laundry to his living quarters, which were in the back of the laundry where he occupied rooms with his wife and child.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.638" offset="1581955">The agent at this point broke open the door, breaking the lock on the door, hurried to the laundry, into the living quarters of petitioner Toy, into the room where his wife and child were in bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.371" offset="1656874">And at this juncture, James Wah Toy reached to open the drawer of a night table whereupon the agent pulled his gun, his handcuffs and placed the petitioner under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.061" offset="1727613">Now at this juncture, none of the other agents was present in the laundry.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.918" offset="1759065">They, thereafter, came into the laundry and the search was made of the laundry.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.033" offset="1791457">And the search was fruitless.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.052" offset="1803577">Nothing was found of interest to the narcotics agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.102" offset="1823744">Now at this juncture, I think I should also point out if the Court please, that petitioner Toy at the time that he opened the door and at no time thereafter insofar as this whole record shows was the “Blackie Toy” referred to by Hom Way because Hom Way's role is completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.557" offset="1921651">And we never hear again of Hom Way in this whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.571" offset="1941608">He didn't testify at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.630" offset="1953938">We hear his name not once more in the whole record.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.437" offset="1973164">And there's no showing that the agent who rang the bell, who knocked on the door had even been given the information that Hom Way had identified “Blackie Toy” as the source of his heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.610" offset="2041814">And of course, there is no equation of “Blackie Toy” with James Wah Toy in this whole record.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.883" offset="2082879">When the agents began interrogation of James Wah Toy, the petitioner, in his bedroom, he was told that Hom Way had identified him as the source of one ounce of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.928" offset="2159052">He immediately denied his guilt and responded, “But I can tell you where there are some narcotics.”</text>
            <text syncTime="524.411" offset="2201057">They showed interest, the agent showed interest when he said, “I know a man named Johnny who has narcotics in his room.”</text>
            <text syncTime="535.986" offset="2247346">And he told the agents where Johnny lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.600" offset="2261765">And he told the agents precisely where the room in the house was which Johnny occupied.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.806" offset="2290604">And the agents immediately went to the place indicated by petitioner Toy where they arrested one Johnny Yee.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.271" offset="2336475">Johnny Yee, as the record shows, immediately surrendered about an ounce of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.802" offset="2374614">And he was interrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.285" offset="2384541">This was at 8 a.m. of the same morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.030" offset="2399483">And he was asked with respect to the source of the heroin found in his possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.145" offset="2435950">And he said, “I've got this heroin from Toy”, petitioner Toy.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.767" offset="2526438">That's an Anglo-Saxon version of a Chinese name as it turns out, Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.518" offset="2549426">He was asked who “Sea Dog” was and he said he knew him by no other name.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.945" offset="2571160">And so the agents then went back to headquarters and they asked petitioner Toy if he knew a man named “Sea Dog.”</text>

            <text syncTime="738.195" offset="3056201">The case came on before a judge without a jury and Johnny Yee was called as the Government's prime witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.849" offset="3090787">It was obviously the intention of the prosecutors can be gleaned from this record to prove his case by calling Johnny Yee who was going to give evidence so the prosecutor thought against these petitioners and then he went off for the narcotics inquisition and had his prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.076" offset="3155675">However, Johnny Yee proved to be a recalcitrant witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.018" offset="3171453">In fact, he stated that a statement that he had therefore given was entirely false.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.822" offset="3202696">And he did not testify against Wong Sun or of petitioner Toy in any respect material to the indictment which was brought against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.459" offset="3245223">And so he was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.391" offset="3252955">And so the prosecutor then had to take another course in proving this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.491" offset="3273331">So he undertook to prove his case this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.901" offset="3290990">He put in the arrest of petitioner Toy at his home, combination of laundry and home.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.601" offset="3329755">He showed the purportedly exculpatory statement that petitioner Toy made at the time of the arrest, “I have no narcotics but I can tell you where you can find some.”</text>
            <text syncTime="819.244" offset="3380328">Then he showed the arrest of Johnny Yee and he offered physically into evidence the narcotics which were taken at Johnny Yee's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.493" offset="3421393">And then, he offered in evidence two statements given by these petitioners subsequent to their arrest, one statement by petitioner Toy which was begun on June 5 the day after his arrest and completed on June 9, another statement which was made by Wong Sun which was given on June 9, both of which contained incriminatory admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.248" offset="3544377">The record, if the Court please, is totally silent with respect to any arraignment procedure with respect to the two petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.922" offset="3603101">Now, the trial judge after admitting all of this evidence over the timely and appropriate objections of trial counsel announced that he -- it was his inclination to find these petitioners guilty under the first count which was the conspiracy count and to find them not guilty on the substantive count.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.209" offset="3708217">But Government counsel quickly pointed out to the trial judge that the Government would feel more sanguine about its record on appeal if he inverted his verdict and found the petitioners not guilty on the conspiracy count and guilty on the substantive count and the trial judge deferred to the Government's wishes in this respect and entered a verdict of not guilty on the conspiracy count and guilty on the substantive count.</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.324" offset="4132655">The Ninth Circuit unanimously found that the arrests of both petitioners were unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.141" offset="4187930">But two of the judges refused to attach any evidentiary consequence to these unlawful arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.425" offset="4233070">One judge dissenting from the majority felt that the evidence gained as a result of the unlawful arrests should have been excluded and that therefore the convictions should have been reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.797" offset="4302555">Now, the Government in this Court undertakes to go behind the finding, the unanimous finding of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.126" offset="4355845">And it seeks to have this Court validate those arrests and therefore obviate the necessity for deciding the evidentiary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.184" offset="4420106">The Government devotes a great portion of its brief to arguing that the arrests of both Toy and Wong Sun were lawful and so to say that that is the end of the matter and there's no need to touch the evidentiary questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.955" offset="4495235">And therefore it becomes necessary to discuss these arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.425" offset="4521044">I think that the Government's attempt to validate these arrests is a very dramatic attempt at bootstrap levitation because the Government in its brief practically concedes that at the time that the agents went to petitioner Toy's premises, they had no probable cause for arresting him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.317" offset="4668688">The Government doesn't argue that at the time they went to his premises at 6:30 in the morning on June 4 that they then and there had probable cause to arrest him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.637" offset="4717902">They argued that the events which took place at the premises provide the link necessary to support a finding of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.531" offset="4793448">They say that from the fact that the agents went there that one of them knocked on the door of petitioner Toy at 6:30 in the morning that thereafter when he attempted to deceive petitioner Toy as to his purpose for being there and that thereafter went petitioner Toy closed the door and left that his hurried departure constituted sufficient to warrant probable cause for his arrest at that juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.311" offset="4940570">I think it's significant to note at this point that at the trial, petitioner Toy's use of the English language was so circumscribed that it was necessary to use an interpreter for him at trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.037" offset="5239515">Now, of course, what the Government is in effect arguing here is that the erratic or emotional behavior of a victim of an unlawfully intrusion or an invasion of rights supplies a missing link that was otherwise not present at the time that the invasion of the rights took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.905" offset="5375039">In other words, the Government is arguing that by virtue of the fact that this man reacted first to the gover -- to the agent's attempt to deceive him and then to his subsequent state with that he was a narcotics agent, the fact that he reacted at 6:30 in the morning and hurried back to his living room gives probable cause for his arrest where it theretofore did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.072" offset="5483708">I think it's most significant however, to look at what the agent who made the arrest says about the arrest because certainly what he says is a basis for influence that he did not regard that he had a probable cause for arresting Toy until such time as Toy reached for the drawer of his night table inside of his bedroom.</text>

            <text syncTime="1447.103" offset="5891741">Now, if the Court please, over and above that there was clearly a violation here of Section 3109 of Title 18 which makes it a requirement for federal officers before they break a door to announce the nature of their authority and the purpose of their visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.894" offset="6006993">Not only did the officer who made the arrest here not announced the purpose of his visit, the purpose of his presence there before he broke the door but he actively attempted to deceive a man whom he did not know to be the “Blackie Toy” for whom he was looking, a man who's identity he did not know, he not only didn't comport with the statute but he specifically and directly violated the statute by attempting to perpetrate a ruse on the occupant of the premises when the door was opened at 6:30 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.662" offset="6190059">And I suggest to the Court that certainly this case falls within the purview of Miller against the United States decided in 1957 by this Court, wherein an arrest was invalidated because of failure to comply with the statutory requirements imposed upon federal officers before breaking doors and entering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.782" offset="6290474">Again, I suggest to the Court that if ever there was a case which required the procuring of an arrest warrant before an arrest was attempted this is it, no reason is advanced why those agents after they listened to the tale of Hom Way did not take him to a commissioner of the City of San Francisco, have him swear to the State in which he had made to the officers, get an arrest warrant and go to the premises in question in de facto an arrest with a warrant on --</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.627" offset="7473925">Now, the Government would contend that his hurrying back from the door adds what is necessary to supply probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.450" offset="7533171">But they overlooked completely the fact, if the Court please, that never at any time is the man who answered the door equated with “Blackie Toy” who was named by Hom Way, never at anytime is this laundry equated with the laundry referred to by Hom Way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.837" offset="7606732">In fact, the record shows that this was not Blackie Toy's restaurant or so designated, it was Oye's Restaurant in the heart of China Town were presumably there are many Chinese laundries on a long street in the City of San Francisco, Leavenworth Street.</text>

            <text syncTime="1989.959" offset="8063248">Now, who were those two informants?</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.777" offset="8086444">Johnny Yee said at the time of his arrest, “I secured the narcotics from a fellow known as “Sea Dog.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.120" offset="8127822">Then they go back to headquarters and they asked Toy, “Do you know a man named “Sea Dog”?”</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.745" offset="8182366">And so they go to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.266" offset="8188426">They roused him out of bed and arrested him, searched his premises, find nothing and the Government says, “This arrest was alright because they had two informants.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2063.411" offset="8356968">Petitioner Toy never said Your Honor that Wong Sun was the source of any heroin or narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.806" offset="8386644">But he was only asked who “Sea Dog” was so there's really only one witness here which the Government attempts to argue is a basis for a lawful arrest because the testimony is in two parts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.657" offset="8498030">And it's further our contention that this arrest constituted the violation of the petitioner's rights under the Fourth Amendment because the Fourth Amendment protects persons as well as things from unreasonable seizures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.371" offset="8640867">Now, since 1914, this Court has attached a very significant evidentiary cons -- consequence to the seizure of physical evidence during an unlawful search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.136" offset="8735953">It has struck down that evidence as inadmissible as being the result of unlawful police action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.244" offset="8780361">Now, I think that the basic reason behind the federal exclusionary rule, the basic reason for which it was adopted was to discourage and deter lawless law enforcement because we recoil at the concept of the -- in justifying the means and the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.058" offset="8887568">And I suppose that the communist form of that thinking is to forget what we're trying to do sometimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.109" offset="8919855">What we're trying to do by the federal exclusionary rule is to strike down lawless law enforcement illegal police action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2230.772" offset="9026435">Now, if benefits are allowed to the police when they violate the legal and constitutional rights of the citizenry, we cannot expect that lawless law enforcement will cease because it's elementary that there's no penalty, there's no sanction that's impose upon the policeman for breaking the law in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.799" offset="9146598">The only thing the court's can do is to make it unprofitable for them to do this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2382.855" offset="9634774">Now, the Government would argue that because Toy didn't have to speak because he spoke freely that the evidence should go in, when I say this is at war with the whole line of cases wherein this Court has struck down voluntarily made statements because the police violated the statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.404" offset="9732995">Then I say the reason has far more force and cogency when you have the violation of the constitutional right as you have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.432" offset="9765073">And that's what we have here, the violation of a constitutional right and a statement made by petitioner Toy at the threshold of his detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.889" offset="9802898">And of course, we must recognize that the McNabb, Upshaw and Mallory cases have created a pressure on the federal police to get threshold confessions on the premise that confessions obtained thereafter maybe inadmissible because of the statutory breach.</text>
