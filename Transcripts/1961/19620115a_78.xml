            <label>Mr. Milton I. Newman</label>
            <text syncTime="13.386" offset="156923">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.911" offset="162983">Mr. Chief Judge, Justice, gentlemen of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.597" offset="185762">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York and it involves the constitutionality of an ordinance of the Town of Hempstead.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.314" offset="240619">I shall presently go into some of the details of statute, but in introducing the statute, I say to Your Honors that this statute prohibits the further excavation of sand and gravel under any circumstances in the Town of Hempstead where there's water.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.056" offset="319613">It prevents anymore excavation under water.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.150" offset="336018">Now in this case, the Appellants Goldblatt and the Corporation, he's a 100% owner of the Corporation, one is the operator of the business of excavating and the other appellant owns the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.779" offset="402474">It involves 38 acres of property in the Town of Hempstead in the County of Nassau in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.907" offset="439045">And the facts of this case, I believe, are not in dispute, certainly not the material facts upon which the decision in this case, I think rests or will elementally rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.782" offset="494529">There's no question about the fact that the excavation here started in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.887" offset="518875">Mr. Goldblatt's father was then the owner of this property and has been in continuous operation from 1927 down to the time that this case started in 19 -- from 1927 down to 1959 when this case started.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.493" offset="581360">That's I think 30 -- 32 years and during that time I must say, one year after it started, water was dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.390" offset="616887">So for 30 years or more, excavation has been taking place underwater in this under -- over these 38 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.692" offset="658160">Actually now, the -- the water covers 20 of the 38 acres and that situation has been in existence since 1928 because the testimony without any contradiction is that one year after they started, as stated Your Honors, they struck water and pond or the water has been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.981" offset="751261">Now, I'd like to state at very (Voice Overlap)</text>

            <text syncTime="174.861" offset="802774">Oh yes -- well, certainly yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.177" offset="812074">I say certainly because the only testimony in the case is that the deposits there have not been exhausted.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.189" offset="860139">Now if Your Honor please, I'd like to say at the very beginning something about this Man Made Lake because I think this was the thinking of a lower court that tried the case and you'll find throughout the brief here such words as used as is if this is a -- a sprawling crater.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.643" offset="933909">This is a -- there are other pits like this where children drowned.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.855" offset="962748">I don't know about other pits.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.617" offset="969853">I'm talking about this pit and I'm talking about this record on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.631" offset="989915">If Your Honors please, we now have 38 acres, 20 acres as I say, covered with water.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.411" offset="1013008">The depth is 25 feet deep average, over the 20 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.866" offset="1034846">Some places as deep as 40 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.505" offset="1045400">This lake and there are pictures here.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.138" offset="1055953">The pictures of the original exhibits are in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.881" offset="1074866">They're not printed in this record but the exhibits number 6 and I ask Your Honors to notice that it's the number six pictures which are ours and those pictures show a lake no different from a God Made Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.809" offset="1134634">I mean, I'm talking about Central Park in New York or Prospect Park or Lake Whitney or some lake in -- in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.428" offset="1177057">It's water, it's a lake and it's covered, surrounded, the whole 38 acres by a six foot fence surrounded on the top with three strands of barbed wire.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.066" offset="1231600">Now if Your Honors please, I tell you in 1927, as when we started to excavate and it wasn't until 1945 that this Town of Hempstead even said we had to have a fence.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.841" offset="1282696">1945 did come around and there was a fence put up and that fence is the six foot fence with three strands of barbed wire on the top of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.439" offset="1325119">And the 1945 statue is a regular tort statue, it talks about the slanted slope and it talks about the width of barb and it talks about the fence.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.659" offset="1377991">Those are regular -- regulations which we complied with in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.036" offset="1399515">No proceeding was brought against us under the 1945 ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.586" offset="1417697">It's a 1948, I'm jumping just for a minute, that we have the amendment of the ordinance which we challenge here as being unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.257" offset="1468374">Now if Your Honors please, in 1956, is the time that the Town of Hempstead first got after us.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.024" offset="1515499">So I may say, get after us, I mean first bought their first legal proceeding and that was a proceeding in Nassau County to prevent us from further excavating under water on the ground that it was violation of the Zoning Act and that case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.098" offset="1579760">It was tried before Mr. Justice Hill in Nassau County and as an appendix to -- in my brief, we have an opinion and a judgment in that case and briefly summarizing that opinion in the judgment, the Court says that he finds -- I'm going to quote -- read one sentence, he finds that the defendants, that's the appellants here are now and have been since 1927 conducting a prior non-conforming use on the premises and they have made such a substantial investment and improvements in the business to warrant the continuance of this non-conforming use.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.590" offset="1725733">Now when the judgment was entered in this case, this is clear sailing, the Judge says, “We have a right to go on” and we did go on in 1956 and in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.622" offset="1773902">There was no appeal taken from Mr. Justice Hill's decision that we had non-conforming use, but the town brought another action in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.597" offset="1817788">I only say this by way of completion because that 1957 action is not important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.086" offset="1835760">In 1957, they came around and again brought us in the court on the ground that we were trying to then extend our excavation activities to the extent of entering into some other allied business and I think the Court properly said, -- or at least it said the Court held -- the New York Court held that that was not a proper extension of our non-conforming use.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.144" offset="1935966">I only state that in passing because it has nothing to do with my opinion now with our ultimate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.746" offset="1958327">Now, comes 1958, and in 1958, no appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Hill, but the amend -- but the enactment of the 1958 ordinance with these provisions particularly Sections 4 (h) and 4 (j) which we challenge in this proceeding in this Court this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.764" offset="2054457">Now, if Your Honor pleases, I might say that contemporaneously with the making of the new 1958 ordinance and before this action in 1959 was started, there was some talks between the town officials and the people that own this property, the appellants in this case, a possibility of taking this property, of paying for the property because it was going to be used in connection with that drainage system and actually in this case, is Exhibit C, that contained, that consists of a drainage map which shows actually the plan of having the surrounding territories water drain ends to this Man Made Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.277" offset="2220492">But nothing came of the -- of the -- of the meetings between the town and -- and the people that owned the property and since the record doesn't contain the material, I won't go further and say why I think they didn't continue with the talks as far as condemnation is concerned but they didn't condemn it.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.514" offset="2309413">What they did instead is to pass the 1958 ordinance and then bring this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.649" offset="2333968">Now, if Your Honor pleases, it is so important because of the element challenge of the question of whether this statute does prohibit that I must read you only two lines, that Section 4 (h) which does prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.032" offset="2395512">That's on 47 of my brief, this paragraph Section 4 (h) of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.769" offset="2418500">It says no excavation shall be made below two feet above the maximum ground water level at the site.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.971" offset="2455280">Simply translated and there can't be dispute about this, all it says is that you can't dig below water level.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.181" offset="2484120">A matter of fact, you can't dig below two feet above water level.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.245" offset="2504391">Put it another way, you can't dig under water.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.789" offset="2518497">They can't be anymore water excavation here, no more hydraulic dredging.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.995" offset="2539395">One of the -- one of the words that appellee used he says water table.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.527" offset="2557471">Maybe, he doesn't like the word water level, but he talks about water table.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.474" offset="2577220">Now, there's no question about the fact as I told you in the beginning, that since 1928, this property has been 25 feet below water level.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.600" offset="2617762">We definitely violate the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.818" offset="2630614">There's no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.046" offset="2639600">We can't comply with the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.253" offset="2648377">The ordinance says, “Don't dig below water level.”</text>
            <text syncTime="639.498" offset="2661334">We dig, we dug that hole below water level 30 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.791" offset="2682546">The statute goes on further and 4 (j) says, “Not only may you no longer dig below water level,” it says, “You got to fill up the hole that you made” and this hole is 20 acres wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.448" offset="2741164">And -- and the testimony of the Town's witnesses is that one million cubic yards have been removed from these 20 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.431" offset="2781080">And we are told in section 4 (j) of the statute, that's a little longer, but that's on page 47, I'm not going to take the time to read that.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.171" offset="2820054">That says, “When the earth is been removed from the pit excavation area, it must be refilled with clean, non-burnable fill, containing no garbage, they give you all the specifications from the clean fill.”</text>
            <text syncTime="693.839" offset="2878777">They want a million cubic yards of fill to be put back into this 20 acres which we removed legally.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.740" offset="4698363">I'm -- the argument about regulation brings them to the one rule upon which I think all the courts below who upheld in favor this constitutionality have depended and that is the question of the presumption of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.175" offset="4784044">Now, the presumption of constitutionality, that's what Judge Burke talks about and he cites the Saxl case decided by this Court and he cites Engel -- Engelsher against Jacobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.816" offset="4826676">Those are the two cases I remember, the main cases he cites there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.840" offset="4842768">He says, “Since this is regulatory, there was a presumption of regulatory -- of constitutionality and we didn't show anything to overcome that presumption.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.678" offset="4886131">I am now summarizing what is more at length written in my brief in deciding the cases that if Your Honors please, there is no presumption of constitutionality with respect to a statute which prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.663" offset="4938062">It's only a statute which regulates that you'd have a presumption of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.076" offset="4963662">I'll go one step further, if Your Honors please and say to you, meeting square on this question of presumption of constitutionality upon which the majority opinion relies and upon which the appellee mains -- makes their main argument that if there were such a presumption, the presumption in this case is certainly overcome by the fact that we have a non-conforming use of our property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.107" offset="5071809">And there are all kinds of cases uniformly hold that you cannot legally constitutional -- constitutionally deprive a man of his non-conforming use without paying for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.101" offset="5123741">The decisions, there are a lot of current decisions and one of the most important I think is the most recent as the -- the term in this case, is the Harbison case in the State of New York in dealing with this question of how do you get rid of a nonconforming use which is a problem presented before so many of the towns of America there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.782" offset="5210467">How do you that constitutionally?</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.676" offset="5222066">And they have held that the only question is how much do you have to pay and the Harbison case said, “Well, you can tell them that in the future, they're going to have to quit doing the jump as that was what in the Harbison case and so you amortize over a period of years, their investment in the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.719" offset="5290297">We don't have any such thing in this case at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1332.867" offset="5434807">In that case, that case involved the Pennsylvania statute which said that you could not dig under a man's house because legislature said and the Governor said in -- in -- in the legislation of that -- in the making of that statute that it was dangerous to dig under a man's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.434" offset="5537102">But the -- the land owner in that case had reserved the right to dig when he sold the house above to the -- to the people and that in my opinion was a much stronger case than this case where there's no -- no evidence at all of danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.455" offset="5605230">I'm coming that in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.545" offset="5613589">There's no evidence on the -- in that Pennsylvania Coal case, it would seem to me just as a layman that is pretty dangerous to dig under a man's house, but they said -- this court said, it's an opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes, he said certainly, it maybe dangerous in maybe the public will requires that you have this legislation but you can't do without paying the man for his property right, for his legal rights of excavating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.943" offset="5727169">He has the right to dig under -- under there by contract module only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.234" offset="5744306">In this case, we have the right to dig there because it's on our property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.039" offset="5811493">Well, if Your Honors please in this -- in the Camarco case, that's a Court of Appeals case in New York, they held squarely that when you have a non-conforming use and we do of course, we do -- I don't have to argue that, we have it legally and that decision of Mr. Justice Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.068" offset="5879620">When you have that you cannot constitutionally come along with a statute and say that the man has -- you can't deprive a man of that constitutional non-conforming use, but the Court said, of course if there's a nuisance here, that's something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.968" offset="5947225">It says it by a way of dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.900" offset="5954957">Now, let come to this question nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.799" offset="5970526">On this question of nuisance, number one, in the Court of Appeals, the appellee here admitted on the argument that there was no nuisance in the operation of our underwater excavation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.385" offset="6036877">He challenges here the question of whether he made that observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.009" offset="6055372">I'm not -- I'm not the one who's contesting you with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.451" offset="6081181">Judge Jan Van Voorhis in his opinion, expressly states that on the argument in the Court of Appeals, counsel for the appellee admitted there was no nuisance, but I'll go further in that concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.942" offset="6131127">I'm not going to decide whether Judge Van Voorhis or my friend here is right about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.112" offset="6151816">I'm talking now about going beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.635" offset="6161951">Number one, there was no evidence of nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.088" offset="6175744">Now, who would have to prove nuisance in order to sustain this legislation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.298" offset="6192567">Certainly, the man that owns the property wouldn't have to show that his property was a nuisance in order to sustain the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.306" offset="6224645">It would necessarily follow that the town would show nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.364" offset="6240841">They have not only shown nuisance, but the proof in the record with respect to the fact that we have a six foot wire of fence that there has -- there was no evidence of a single trespasser, not a single accident, not a single death, not a single cave-in, no property damage and this is under 30 years margin, 30 years of operation, 15 years in which there wasn't even fence around there because we weren't required to have it fenced until 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.613" offset="6365811">Now I say the facts in the case certainly would show that there's no nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.246" offset="6384306">There was no proof of nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.578" offset="6389635">There was a concession of no nuisance and certainly there was no nuisance per se in the fact that there's water there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.847" offset="6414712">And I want to say a word about this water because this water you see, when they talk about sprawling crater, again the trial judge talked about sprawling crater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.489" offset="6453373">There's the implication that there's something, somewhere, something wrong about water, except that I'm page 11 of their brief, they have now said, we don't contend that there's any nuisance per se in water or in excavating so we don't have to contend with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.873" offset="6518888">But there is that aura that -- that atmosphere of something wrong with water and I'm coming back and saying to Your Honors that because we have water, that doesn't make our -- our operations dangerous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.380" offset="6956910">The fact that the town now realizes that they made a mistake if they didn't bring any evidence of nuisances, they bring in by the -- they bring in one case one death, which they claimed took place in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.238" offset="7016364">It's not on the record, it's not on the record, it was not in the trial, in 1944, before there was any requirement by the town itself, that it has a fence around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.707" offset="7062235">I'm just going to say in passing, if they have a right to tell you about one death that took place in 1944, I have a right to tell you that by the police records of the City of New York, I discovered that 1960 with three deaths in Central Park and one in Prospect Park, but that has nothing to do with -- with eliminating a man's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.241" offset="7148335">You Honors Mr. Justice -- Judge Van Voorhis said, “Automobiles kill people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.935" offset="7167143">You don't get rid automobiles because people are killed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.054" offset="7275604">I think the Court has gone beyond the question of necessity of having a criminal law involved in order to have ex post facto but in this case, you got ex post facto as far as the criminal law is concerned, with those sections that I read you, Section 10 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.260" offset="7340387">In addition to that, I think that under the Fleming case, this is even a violation of the statute -- of the constitutional provision with respect bill of attainder because of the fact that we are the only operating sand pit excavation company in this entire Town of Nassau -- Town of Hempstead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.128" offset="7435891">And there's no question about the fact that the history of this thing in the 1945 proceedings in court and the 1946 proceedings with respect to try to get rid of this first by zoning and then talking news about condonation and then finally passing the statute means they pointed the statute directly at us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.626" offset="7521886">But I don't think -- well, I think that directly comes under that -- under the both those sections of the constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.170" offset="7560025">Your Honor please I like to finally say that when the Court of Appeals main opinion written by Judge Burke talks about the fact that there must be progress, I won't argue with them that it must be progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.335" offset="7604746">I won't argue with them with respect to whether he think -- whether the legislator is right in thinking they'd like to get rid of our pit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.591" offset="7649782">There's no question they want to get rid of our excavation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.049" offset="7663574">For all I say to you is in the words of Justice Holmes -- Mr. Justice Holmes in the Pennsylvania Coal case, we are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shortcut in the constitutional way of paying for the change and that's all we're asking.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Mattison</label>
            <text syncTime="1939.002" offset="7859388">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.775" offset="7882480">Just before he died and probably his last recorded interview, Leonard Hand deprecated his life on the bench with a comment to an author that he has spent his life Shoveling Smoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.983" offset="7935352">And I suggest to this Court with humility and sincerity that difficult as the judicial process is, it becomes even more so, when a record has been made implosively, acceptable by its interpretation both and briefs and in oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.174" offset="8024064">This morning -- this afternoon, I would like to address myself initially to some of the incorrect statements that have made -- have been made with respect to the brief, the proof of this case as it unfolded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.915" offset="8087071">In the first place through all the courts, and in six memorandum and specific language of our brief in the Court of Appeals in which we said, “Pits like this constitute a public nuisance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.092" offset="8135764">We urged that this nuisance, that this pit was nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.937" offset="8151124">And when Judge Van Vhooris asked me, “Did I contend it with nuisance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.913" offset="8170977">I said, “Your Honor, I do not have to contend that it is a nuisance, because I do have the affirmative on this burden” and I respectfully submit that my inarticulate answer to him was because of some confusion which -- for which perhaps I was responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.610" offset="8237850">This pit is a nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.967" offset="8243284">We maintain that the record shows it's a nuisance and we maintain in answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's question which opened the argument that there was no factual proof of confiscation in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.455" offset="8297200">The question Mr. Justice Harlan asked was, “Was there any economic use left?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.348" offset="8320815">Now, there is no proof at the trial at all, and the trial court so held in its long and comprehensive opinion that there were any available deposits that worth mining on the question of factual confiscation under the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.149" offset="8391973">There was a total failure of proof with respect to the 18 acres which remain above land, and the trial court pointed out that on this record, the appellant's may still mine that 18 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.917" offset="8455084">Now, this ordinance was a companion ordinance to -- an ordinance that was passed in the Town of Hempstead -- town of North Hempstead and Town of Oyster Bay, the -- the three towns making up Nassau County in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.649" offset="8521958">And as the ordinances all of them in their identical declarations and in their regulatory provisions mandate, the danger to which the decree was addressed was a three fold, one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.830" offset="8582666">First to the threat of water pollution, to pollution of the water table, Nassau County draws all its water from this subterranean table, second, to the unsettling of houses surrounding the community of these pits and third and perhaps most important of all to the threat of drowning of little children in the pits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.379" offset="8676916">In -- a 1957 case, 12 years after the enactment of this ordinance which case we cite on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.786" offset="8710562">The Supreme Court of the State of New York in Nassau County pointed out that it is a common knowledge that heretofore many lives of young children have been lost in these pits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.030" offset="8755493">Now, against this background --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="2165.812" offset="8766568">And these pits referring to what particular pit (Voice Overlap)?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_c_mattison" startTime="2169.402" stopTime="2523.144">
            <label>Mr. William C. Mattison</label>
            <text syncTime="2169.402" offset="8780988">The language in the (Inaudible) case was to unguarded, unregulated pits and of course Mr. Chief Justice, we take that as our starting point in the regulation of the pits to make this three-fold threat to our community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.927" offset="8843055">Now, the first suggestion is that this is a tailor-made ordinance and I think that the common knowledge to which the courts have reverted and our appellate division unanimously affirmed and our Court of Appeals referred to this refutes the suggestion that this was some criminal conspiracy in which this town engaged to eliminate this use by these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.241" offset="8956322">Today, there has been another misstatement which has been a continuing one for the record that there wasn't total compliance with the 1945 ordinance as it was first enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.105" offset="9015777">The Court will look in vain to find support to this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.761" offset="9042422">The argument is made today that there is no presumption accompanying the enactment of this ordinance because it is a prohibitory one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.948" offset="9083173">I pause only to read the simple sentence from the Powell case which we cite in our brief which involved the total disability to manufacture (Inaudible) in which this Court said of a totally prohibitory statute, “Every possible presumption in favor of the validity of the statute and is in favor the validity of the statute,” and this continues until the contrary shown beyond a rational doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.315" offset="9200619">Now, the argument is made here today that there were drainage conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.693" offset="9226115">Again, the Court will not quite look in vain for competent -- comprehensible testimony of that conferred -- drainage conferences but will find these alleged conferences in colloquies and then openings in the record, and of course even if they were, our position is that the town does not have to pay the price on the exercise, the legitimate exercise of a police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.379" offset="9328933">It does not have to pay the price of buy-in all of this, a public nuisance and a threat to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.120" offset="9359862">The suggestion has made again in counsel's brief and in his oral argument that we did not affirmatively prove that this was a nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.285" offset="9392462">We point out that this burden traditionally does not belong to us and that the burden of establishing that the statute, the ordinance is itself unreasonable belongs to the assailant who attacks it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.515" offset="9453484">Now, the trial court held in its opinion that there was no qualitative evidence addressed to the unreasonableness of this ordinance and on this argument, it seems to me that there has been a concession that there was at least a legitimate area of legislation when in 1945, the three towns, these one included addressed itself to the dangers, the three-fold dangers which faced their communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.767" offset="9574484">Actually as I understand the argument of the appellant's here today, it is like the argument that was made in the Saxl case which we cite on our brief where they do not question the power to legislate in this field, but where they complain that the steps that we have taken are not -- are not determinative of the best legislative judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.356" offset="9692766">The town, the appellant cites Pennsylvania against Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.578" offset="9725680">I think that this is the only case in which they really rely and the case itself I think is totally distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.473" offset="9765282">Mr. Justice Holmes put the principal reliance on the case on the two-fold aspect that it involves a private wrong and that it involve the impairment of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.801" offset="9826617">On the issue of res judicata this question, the impairment of the judgment was raised at the subsequent action which was commenced under this ordinance and which is -- which as counsel in the brief show had been discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.603" offset="9909791">When the question was raised under the prior enforcement attempt under this ordinance, the same argument was made namely, that the 1956 judgment giving them their vested right to continue this prior nonconforming use was res judicata and the Supreme Court held in an opinion the text that which we cite in our brief that the judgment in the nonconforming use case had no applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.148" offset="10039986">It did not constitute both, in this case in which the issues were essentially different ones although the parties were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.961" offset="10095261">The question was asked whether -- by Mr. Justice Black whether this judgment before this Court requires refill and the answer to Mr. Justice Black is emphatically no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.186" offset="10168090">The judgment contains no affirmative mandate requiring refill.</text>
