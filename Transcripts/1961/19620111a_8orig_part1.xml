            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2.428" offset="113037">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.212" offset="132263">There are a number of questions which we're left open at the end of the session yesterday that I would like to try to deal with at the beginning of the sessions this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.487" offset="181269">The most convenient one to discuss first is to say a word about more -- about the meaning of perfected right and to tell the Court what I have been able to find about the usage of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.096" offset="243754">To acquire or to avoid begging the question, I will call a complete water right.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.889" offset="270921">It's clear under the law of all the western states, as I believe, that a series of steps are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.098" offset="307806">One begins perhaps by making a claim and, as I understand it, under the law of some states, this may be done by making a -- posting the claim near the stream under statutes that may be filed, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.718" offset="362245">After one makes claim, he then begins to construct the works for diverting the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.672" offset="394010">He may make the claim, say, and begin the construction of works in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.531" offset="417520">Then he goes on, goes the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.862" offset="430791">He may have completed the works in 1955 and begun his diversion of the water, let us say, in 1957 and applied it to beneficial use later in the year 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.459" offset="493171">Now, as I read all the authorities, he does not have a complete appropriation or complete water right until he has either diverted the water which appears to be the law in California, at least earlier, or has actually applied it to beneficial use which appears to be the law in most of the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.095" offset="595780">Now, it is at that stage in 1957 that his right is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.330" offset="624724">It is also true that when he completes the work in 1957 and applies the water to the land, or under some of the California decision makes the diversion that it gets it all there to apply to the land, that he has an appropriative right.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.700" offset="702151">When that is done, it relates back to 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.542" offset="725556">So that, he would come ahead of someone else who perhaps had completed the whole business in 1955 and he would have the prior right.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.232" offset="776338">Now, the usage is also not uncommon, I would say common, to speak of what's done in 1957, the series of steps to speak of what he then has as a perfected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.304" offset="844570">For example, Hutchins in the California law of water rights, on page 108 says, “It was said in an early case that an appropriation consist of a series of steps which, taken together, make the right perfect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="201.426" offset="909040">Of course, this is our usage in speaking of liens, and gifts, and other things but the final step is what perfects it.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.987" offset="939342">Similarly, in killing on irrigation in the water rights, in the second volume, the first sentence of Section 728, the appropriation becomes perfect only when the dams, ditches, or canals, or other works necessary are entirely complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.121" offset="1023875">The water diverted from the natural stream or other source of supply had actually used for beneficial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.424" offset="1053027">He says, “That is when the right is perfect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="241.158" offset="1067969">Will does not use, so far as I can discover, the term “perfect” at any stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.608" offset="1093778">We weren't able to find it last evening in any event, but he does lay down, he summarizes, the rules that I've just stated without using the word “perfect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="257.911" offset="1135052">In Section 398 of the third -- this is -- I'm reading from the third edition, Section 398.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.677" offset="1170056">Now, it's interesting to note that --</text>

            <text syncTime="291.442" offset="1269112">Mr. Bratton, in the debate had another suggestion with respect to the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.656" offset="1297951">So, we have something not colored by any of these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.165" offset="1312057">He was proposing that people who had perfected rights should not be charged by the -- for -- by the Secretary for the impounded water, but those who didn't have perfected rights who are getting new rights after the project was completed should be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.222" offset="1384260">That's of no importance here and it didn't carry but, in the course of making that suggestion, Mr. Bratton showed how he understood this term “perfected right” and he suggested that there should be a disti -- the distinction I mentioned between those who have perfected their water rights by the actual application of water to beneficial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.203" offset="1480182">And he used that term -- this is 70 Congressional Record 73, and he uses a similar expression over on page 74.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="354.977" stopTime="356.530">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="356.530" offset="1529501">Senator Bratton, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.133" offset="1543920">I find that perfected was used again by Mr. Brandeis in 283 United States in Arizona against California, where he says on page 459, “Under the law of Arizona, the perfected vested right to appropriate water within the state cannot be acquired without the performance of physical acts through which the water is and well in fact be diverted to beneficial use -- is and will in fact be diverted to beneficial use”, so that, he spoke of perfected as something that happens when all these acts have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.710" offset="1698252">And, just one last reference to show that this isn't unique by any means, I find in the head note, through rocky deposer, 48 Colorado 134, describing the decree in an earlier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.269" offset="1776410">It said all other rights were left inchoate and became absolute only upon application of the water the beneficial uses within a reasonable time, and whether a perfected right to the enjoinment of the water had vested was left to be determined in some future appropriate proceeding, in other words, whether it had been appropriated to the beneficial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.843" offset="1878706">One also finds Senator Hayden frequently using the term in this sense in the debate on the division of the water but of course that's, to some extent, self-serving and I think the more significant one is Senator Bratton's use of the term in connection with something quite different, where he wasn't arguing a case about existing rights in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.413" offset="1977031">Now, the -- so, I take it, that as a matter of usage, that perfected right is one which you have because you've done all the acts, including the application to beneficial use.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.937" offset="2119137">This is not in the -- this is not -- the practice, at least in the eight western states, is on the basis of statutes and court decisions as to when it is perfected.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.596" offset="2185801">And, I have no doubt of what -- you're generalizing it and putting it in a bold type for a hornbook if what you say is true, but the important thing is that it's a local law question, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="566.594" offset="2369703">Under the Reclamation Act, the rights were defendant, as I understand it, first, on contract with the Secretary.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="581.463" offset="2429262">I think here, the relevance of the discussion of perfected right was, first, this is the base of so much of the argument that it's important we have the terms clear but, second, the term we are of course directly concerned with is not simply perfected right but present perfected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.275" offset="2500524">And, the question that would finish off this discussion, in my judgment, is what was added by putting present in front of perfected.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.369" offset="2548799">And to me, it suggests that the Congress and the authors of the Colorado River Compact and the authors of these various proposals that led up to the Project Act, when they used the term, all met rights which are now perfected.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.167" offset="2616090">The rights that are presently perfected rights, in other words, that have been perfected, not rights that might be perfected in the future and then, by the process to the state law, relate back.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.100" offset="2671783">In other words, it's the addition of the adjective “present” that the Master thought, and which we think, establish this cutoff point on the date in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.279" offset="2716505">I said 1928 yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.885" offset="2722879">I should have said 1929 when the Project Act became effective, because that's about the only meaning present perfected right, current perfected right can, in my judgment, have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.910" offset="5922983">That -- that is true -- would be true, except for the bearings which present perfected right has on the question, whether Congress intended a pro rata reduction of the share of each in the case of shortage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.488" offset="6101347">Our theory of statute, as I've said many times, is that it contemplates a federal interstate apportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.963" offset="6143248">That it lays down the general guidelines and gives the Secretary of the Interior the power to flush out skeletons and to determine, out of the water that California doesn't get, exactly how much Nevada will get and exactly how much Arizona will get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.007" offset="6223391">The statute gives guides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.549" offset="6229556">Nature virtually made that division, but the Secretary had power, in our view, to finish it out by contract and he did in the early 1940's, give Arizona 2.8 billion acre-feet, and Nevada by 0.3 billion acre-feet, and he gave Arizona one-half of the surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.554" offset="6321612">I point out in passing that his Act can be squared only with our reading of Section 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.009" offset="6359437">That, although the contract say it's Arizona's legal right, it's perfectly plain that the Secretary acted on the view that the mainstream was being apportioned 4.4, 2.8, and 0.3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.694" offset="6418160">And, we say that those contracts, as the Master said, constitute an allocation of those amounts among the states provided that there is 7.5 million acre-feet of mainstream water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.353" offset="6476779">Then, the question arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.325" offset="6484720">Well, suppose there isn't 7.5 million acres-feet of mainstream water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.719" offset="6506245">What do we do then?</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.364" offset="6512828">And, we come to what Mr. Ely stressed as the priority branch of his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.017" offset="6539473">There would seem to be a prior right, three possible answers to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.651" offset="6566013">One, that the law of prior appropriation governs, and of course that's California's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.343" offset="6592763">Two, that the Secretary has power to make the allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.243" offset="6608332">The Secretary hasn't provided for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.399" offset="6620975">So, until he does something and does say who shall be the users in this event, the matter simply stands unresolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.156" offset="6664025">Nobody is arguing for that position but it certainly is one of the possible readings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.733" offset="6686281">The third possibility, the one which the Master followed and the one which we think is correct, is to say that there should be a ratable deduction -- a ratable reduction on each of the states subject, as you point out Justice Whittaker, to the qualification that present perfected rights, as I've defined, must first be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.644" offset="6797981">The Master recommended the ratable deduction, and we think it's proper, because it is the most consistent, as we see it, with what we know about policies and aims of the Compact and the Project Act and in deriving insight into the aims and policies of the Compact and the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.180" offset="6896097">With the respect to this matter, to which nobody addressed himself explicitly, the Master laid and we laid a great deal of stress on the term “present perfected right” because we think that, in both instances, it shows an intension to establish a cutoff point as of the date on which those documents speak and to start over again with the new federal allocation as of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.214" offset="7036217">One of the reasons we're doing that or, being that the claim is to the river which had not been perfected previously were -- disputed many of them, unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.242" offset="7092328">Some of them, like that of Metropolitan Los Angeles, couldn't really mean anything until the Boulder Dam was built -- the Hoover Dam was built, and the water was brought under control by the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.216" offset="7160247">And this is the sense in which the term seems to be used in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.117" offset="7183862">A second reason for concluding that there was to a ratable deduction is that there is every indication that also the shares of the states differed in size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.593" offset="7237778">They were thought to be of equal dignity and that, therefore, there should be equality of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.962" offset="7263169">This would seem to imply in the event that there wasn't the 7.5 million acre-feet to go around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.786" offset="7294516">Now, the Master stressed that instruction, first, to protect present perfected rights for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.324" offset="7340701">In the first place, he said there's no reason to put this in the statute if priority of appropriation is to be controlling in the event of shortages because that would supply with a system for protecting not only perfected rights but imperfect rights, speaking as of the time the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.699" offset="7434219">Second, in some instances giving protection -- prior protection to present perfected rights is inconsistent with the law of prior appropriation because you might have a case where a man started his appropriation in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.078" offset="7515721">He worked on it and he perfected it in 1960, but somebody else came on and started in 1955 and finished in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.723" offset="7562219">Now, under the present perfected rights as the Master points out, the intermediate fellow would be protected if the statute were enacted in 1958 instead of 1928, whereas, under the law of prior appropriation, it would come out the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.903" offset="7658977">One of the other important factors, it seems to us, with respect to the matter of a ratable reduction, is that it has been the practice of the Secretary of Interior in entering into contracts under the Reclamation Act to provide that if there is a shortage, the available water shall be shared ratably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.604" offset="7749778">And it's partly to protect those contracts in that practice that I had the difference apparently with Mr. Justice Douglas and urge the Court not to embark in this and discussing this point in its opinion in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.275" offset="7816443">But to delete those parts of the Mater's report.</text>

            <text syncTime="2634.867" offset="10642892">And we think it was within the implied power of the Secretary in contracting to say that if you, Arizona or you, Nevada, prevent the supply then -- from developing, then I'm going to reduce what I give you in the amount that you have shorted the supply, if I could be very colloquial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3185.864" offset="12846791">On the other hand, the State of Nevada, while the amounts of water involved are small, is so-situated that it probably will be the most direct -- directly and precisely affected by the outcome of this litigation than any state involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.135" offset="12943862">For that reason, after the institution of the action, the state through its then Attorney General, Mr. William T. Mathews, and who has been in the case throughout, is accompanying me here today, intervened on the theory that Nevada, as one of the three sovereign Lower Basin states, had an interest which would be inevitably affected by the outcome of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.893" offset="13070921">Nevada's situation is along the western and northern side of the Lake Mead Reservoir and the stream immediately below as shown by the map which has been placed on the easel and also it is indicated by the map B which California supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.413" offset="13197040">A brief description of some of the geographical features I think is in order because they affect particularly the issues between the United States and Nevada on the two exceptions the United States has taken to the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.718" offset="13270288">Nevada finds itself in this perhaps unique position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.226" offset="13292231">It was an intervener in the action and, now, when the case has reached this posture, it finds itself more completely supporting the Master's theory than any other party to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.281" offset="13372479">The -- on geographical feature of Nevada divided generally into two faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.455" offset="13409155">Generally to the North of Lake Mead, there are streams entering the Virgin River which originates in Utah, comes across the corner of Arizona, and comes down into the reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.681" offset="13474147">Prior to the construction of the reservoir, the Muddy River which came in from the northwest, with the long tributary called the Meadow Valley Wash, flowed into the Virgin before it run into the Colorado, but that amount has been obscured by the reservoir itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.823" offset="13558680">As I understand, answering a question of one of the justices yesterday, the dam itself merely in the -- what would be the upper end of Black Canyon or somewhere in the part of that, there was Black Canyon where Nevada is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.008" offset="13623359">There was a -- kind of an open flight stair in that big canyon with an old pioneer fork and then the Boulder Canyon is immediately above.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.593" offset="13661706">So, into a Black Canyon and Boulder Canyon are practically contiguous and they are in the reservoir which extends to the north, flows by as water that is impounded and backed up into the Valley of the Virgin River, sometimes known as the Virgin R, as in reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.549" offset="13757524">On the Virgin River and the Muddy River, there was what was for that area a very early settlement, starting along in the 1870's by pioneers most of whom came down from Utah and were of the LDS Faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.509" offset="13829413">And for a long time, and -- that was the only settlement in that area because there was only place where it was possible to divert water for irrigation and there on those tributaries, at long standing existence is an irrigated area with a consumptive use somewhere in the neighborhood of 50,000 acre-feet of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.344" offset="13928782">I will come back to this again later, but that is one of the questions where we argue with the United States as to whether our 300,000 acre-feet, which everyone says Nevada was always going to be given, should be diminished by not 50,000 acre-feet of pre-existing consumptive use.</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.380" offset="14408913">At that point, in fact the reason the dam is there is that there is this deep canyon but even with the dam of the height that it is and the water impounded in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.841" offset="14466696">It is still necessary to raise the water from the dam over into the Las Vegas Valley by pumping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.231" offset="14508283">The first pump at that time was installed by the Bureau of Reclamation as a part of the construction of the dam to supply Boulder City, which has now become a very beautiful garden spot by reason of the application of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.437" offset="14569096">The use of water in -- the expanding use, I should say, that is involved in this case is that in the Las Vegas Valley area and the several surrounding valleys which extend to the south and to the north and to the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.154" offset="14675989">Being confronted with a situation where California was saying Nevada can have water for existing use and no more, as has been repeated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.497" offset="14741400">Nevada employed a group of the most eminent experts that she could obtain, had detailed analysis of the lands made, had economic studies of possible future growth developed, had studies made of the mineral possibilities, evaluation of the excellent transportation facilities that exist in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.849" offset="14858742">The climate which is the type that is currently drawing into the southwest this great migration of people, and endeavored to make the best possible study that could be made as to what would reasonably be the population and the requirement of water in the year 2000, not assuming any increase in irrigation but assuming uses for domestic use, industrial uses, and municipal use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.729" offset="15006281">The belief of those making the study in the State of Nevada was that, as a sovereign state, it had a inherent right, as one of the Lower Basin states, to apportion of the water of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.522" offset="15089455">It was not the thought to assert that right by any extravagant claims that we should take this precious water and use it for irrigation purposes, but if the area was to grow, if there were to be people there, by then it was going to be necessary to bring in this Colorado River water up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.894" offset="15186944">Probably, the second biggest step in bringing the water was done in conjunction to the United States of America building the great Henderson Magnesium Plants during the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.262" offset="15228426">The United States Government assisted to the extent of several hundred million dollars there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.175" offset="15248071">The closeness of the great power supply, the availability of the water supply, and so forth created this great complex which supply of practically all the magnesium which was used during World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.705" offset="15302196">Those plants have now been transferred over to private enterprise where there is a complex of chemical and other similar industries there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.495" offset="15337305">Then the water district of -- it supplies domestic water to the City of Las Vegas and its environs found that it was running very short of water because its underground basin, the only source of water, was being overdrawn to extend 20,000-25,000 acre-feet every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.654" offset="15417971">It isn't necessary to stop the drilling of additional wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.823" offset="15434689">And so, through the Colorado River Commission which I will mention in detail later, which is the body of the State of Nevada created approximately simultaneously with the creation of this project to take and handle Nevada's share of this precious water and to see that it was distributed in the correct and the most beneficial way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.533" offset="15537507">This Colorado River Commission participated in increasing the size of this pumping plant from the river and bringing the water over for de -- beneficial use in that area, and there are continuing plans for a continually expanding use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.802" offset="15610546">The point that I am particularly emphasizing is that this need of water in Nevada is principally for the -- just the plain support of human life, and the number of people that are going to ever be able to live in that area is going to be fixed by the amount of water available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.655" offset="15713991">If we assume -- these engineer's designs have many figures, but if we assume an average gallon per day consumption of around 300 gallons per day, which seems to be fairly acceptable for all of them, an acre-foot of water will support about three people for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.959" offset="15815241">And if we're -- if California is saying that you don't get your 300,000 acre-feet, you only get 120,000 acre-feet, the hundred -- the missing 180,000 feet would be your water supply for roughly around half-a-million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.745" offset="15902386">And, whenever the Nevada's participation in the Colorado River water has reached the maximum of it, that will inevitably be the maximum or top of the development where there is no seawater to be converted, there is no brackish water to be converted and, so far as anything now known in even the most penetrating crystal ball, there is no other source of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.474" offset="16029236">Passing to the subject that we -- that has been discussed at so much length here, it has occurred to us that a good deal of the confusion is due to the fact that, in the one Act which we call the Project Act, there has been taken two steps which in most common historical custom, at least in the west, has been accomplished separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.740" offset="16158281">And, those two steps is the ratification of the Compact between sovereign states and the United States, on the one hand, and the other is the authorization of this great project which combines the dam, the reservoir, the power plant, the diversion dam down in Imperial, and the Great All-American Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.626" offset="16273847">The -- ordinarily, as I say, those were probably been done separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.136" offset="16303940">In other words, the states after their meeting which has been discussed at such great length came over to Congress with the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.151" offset="16343960">I think it is -- as it has been said, it is only necessary to hear and determine those parts of the Compact which perhaps as definitions are by reference used in the Project Act and the language which has caused much of the confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.622" offset="16441866">But so far as the Compact itself, it isn't so theoretically complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.656" offset="16473945">As we read it, they agreed that there would be set aside for beneficial use up to 7.5 million acre-feet annually in the Upper Basin and 8.5 million acre-feet in the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.883" offset="16534862">That the Upper Basin then always permit 75 million acre-feet in this rolling ten year period to encompass Lee Ferry, plus any amounts it might be required to contribute to the Mexican burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.272" offset="16608423">They agreed that the Upper Basin would not withhold nor would the Lower Basin ever require the delivery of any water unless it was actually needed for beneficial consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.966" offset="16655235">In that Compact, they originated this what I think, unique term “present perfected rights” as being unimpaired to the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.337" offset="16720750">And they used it -- and they used it alone in that one sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.573" offset="16737677">Elsewhere in the Compact, they talk about appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.416" offset="16761083">Again in this action it seems to me, since the final decision is going to be a construction of the Project Act, it becomes important to think of that term “present perfected rights” only because by reference it is carried over into the part of the Act which authorized this great project as separate from the part of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.167" offset="16868080">And then there is one other provision in the Compact that has -- I believe some impact on a construction of the Project Act, and that is the provision which, so far as the Compact is concerned, says whenever there are five million or more acre-feet of storage in the Lower Basin that this present perfected rights are to be supplied from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.294" offset="16996498">By “it”, I mean the storage water.</text>

            <text syncTime="4231.277" offset="17028472">The -- and then as I mentioned that languages by reference carried over into the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.653" offset="17074030">Now, the Congress made only one change in that Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.644" offset="17089912">If at that time they hadn't been bothering about building -- or authorizing the construction, rather of the project itself, the only they said, "If the seven states can agree on this contract within six months, we will approve it in six states in agreement, provided that California passes the limitation which has been referred to so repetitiously in this action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.299" offset="17192521">That's the only change in the Compact that was made by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.100" offset="17207777">And the Congress and the Compact, if we think of it, segregated out and think of it as a separate document, therefore, stands as an agreement between the states covering the points that I have mentioned in with this California limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.650" offset="17274023">Obviously, the Compact did not endeavor to allocate the water between the states of the Upper Basin or the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.659" offset="17318013">As has been mentioned, the Upper Basin states were able to agree and have themselves allocated the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.747" offset="17346330">The Lower Basin states, I -- they are no more in agreement in 1962 then they were in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.666" offset="17386036">That situation remained static.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.970" offset="17399202">But certainly when Congress affirmed the Compact, it was not in the Compact sense, in any sense attempting to allocate the waters between the Lower Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.127" offset="17463881">I don't -- it's been pointed out and it's obvious from this lengthy legislative history, it was repeatedly stated by the senators affected that they were not going to write a Compact for the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.426" offset="17541099">That they were not going to make it mandatory on any of the states in the Lower Basin to do this or to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.812" offset="17578611">And that they were no more attempting to do that for the Lower Basin than they were for the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.592" offset="17601703">But it was absolutely necessary, if we look at the other part of the situation and think of the authorization of this project, that the Congress must of necessity make some provisions where the disposition of the water that was going to be stored in and delivered from that project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.145" offset="17691982">And that's as inevitable as day following night and I believe it is the logical interpretation of this Act that all of this discussion of this 7.5 million acre-feet that's going to be divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.716" offset="17766275">Always 300,000 to Nevada, except today when we find it cut down, and 2 million acre to Arizona and this fluctuating amount to California, that that inevitably must be considered to be a determination of a distribution of water that was going to be controlled by that project and derived from it and resulting, as I will mention it in a moment, from the water right of that project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.122" offset="17919875">It seems to me that the one gap in our thinking and are arguing here is what was the water right of that project?</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.222" offset="17960312">But, before I go to that, the Congress must consider, how the waters that were going to originate when this great reservoir was created?</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.527" offset="18009527">How it was going to be divided just as much as it would as the power, as mentioned by Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.224" offset="18044217">They were the inherent results, the only reason, for expending this great amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.821" offset="18094686">Now then, this suit in some way turns upon the argument of California which is based upon the assumption that the water priorities that existed on that river survived the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.098" offset="18163754">That is a corner stone of the California briefs, both before the Mater and before this Court in the argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.623" offset="18193847">And the fact is, I believe that that whole body of argument is just as valid as the basic exemption and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.311" offset="18240658">And I think it is -- the basic exemption is contrary to what actually happened when the United States of America, through its Congress decided to enter upon this navigable stream and build this combined power and water project and in effect preempted if I might say, the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.688" offset="18350164">There has been some facetious remarks that there was a Red River there which on one of the maps, I think this map chart A -- chart B as starts at the upper reaches of Lake Mead and continues down to the Mexican boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.924" offset="18451101">Well, the color is not particularly significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.390" offset="18468968">There are certainly can be no doubt that at this time, that that separate river is a very real and a distinct thing because that entire area of the river has been taken under control by the United States by the series of dams starting with the Hoover Dam, the Lake Mead, or the Davis Dam, the Parker Dam, the Headgate Rock Dam, the Imperial Dam, and all of the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.751" offset="18574399">There is a body of water extending from Lake Mead to the Mexican border which is being handled and controlled by the United States as a separate and distinct entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.821" offset="18626644">And I am inclined to think that Judge Rifkind was entirely logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.545" offset="18653602">In his result, we may quarrel with his language but he found before him as he sat and listened to these millions of words, that there was that section of river, a reservoir, and a series of dams, and the diversion from it, that the United States was handling, that it was controlling and, out of which, the water had to be delivered and concerned which -- the Secretary had made contracts for the delivery of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.146" offset="18775960">Now then, of course the basic water supply for this whole complex along the river, one -- I think one of the most magnificent in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.790" offset="18846490">What was the water right for the dam itself?</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.384" offset="18860910">As it had been pointed out by questions from the court, it is the general custom of the Bureau of Reclamation, the same entity that built this dam, Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.379" offset="18908871">He goes out to build the dam on the Yakima River or the Boise River, the Snake River, and any other rivers and all the rest, he acquires a water right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.868" offset="18954846">He acquires the right to take over the flow of that stream and now there are other people there with other water rights and many times older ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.741" offset="18998314">They got there first because in some ways on the western streams the United States is what may be called a Johnny-come-lately, and that's the water right for the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.674" offset="19042095">It's the one that, under Section 8 of the reclamation law, it has been the custom of the Department of Interior to acquire under state law in every instance, so far as I know, except that of the Boulder Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.289" offset="19096534">If this normal procedure had been followed by the Secretary of the Interior, he would have gone to the State of Nevada where one end of the dam is located and the State of Arizona where the other end of the dam is located and say, “I am going to build this project and I want to take the necessary steps to get a water right for it.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4943.627" offset="19877909">Well, I don't know whether they could even be characterized as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.607" offset="19889821">And 50,000 acre-feet is a consumptive use figure of uses above Lake Mead and that comes into effect here more in our controversy with the Government over deductions from the Nevada contract than they do from a determination of what are the rights in the mainstream itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.620" offset="19973831">But as -- I think this is true that, from the action of the Congress in the Project Act, the Secretary of the Interior in making his contracts for the California users was charged with the necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.933" offset="20055124">He must recognize those present perfected rights and he couldn't not take them into account as well as he was by the limitation which would put the ceiling on the total amount of water that California could take of out of this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.928" offset="20159091">Now, such a determination, in my opinion, would be consistent with the entire body of water law in the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.198" offset="20224188">I think we should look at, since the major thrust of this whole contention here is what were the rights of the California parties, as to what their rights were at that time that would in -- unquestionably come in as present perfected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.324" offset="20296704">There were the old rights of the Yuma District and of the Palo Verde District which have been described here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.687" offset="20334111">Under any interpretation of the Master's decree, those rights would be ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.606" offset="20365772">So, I see no reason to spend any particular time talking about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.272" offset="20388446">They were old in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.073" offset="20395656">They're given the oldest priorities in this intrastate seven-party California agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.810" offset="20422614">They have, I am sure, however, changed their character before Boulder Dam was constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.591" offset="20465768">They were simply running the river rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.323" offset="20476635">If the river was there running enough water to supply them, they got the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.162" offset="20500041">If it wasn't there, obviously, they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.802" offset="20514565">The next in point of quantity and perhaps the breaking point are the rights of the Imperial Irrigation District.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.809" offset="20550614">And it seems to me that there has been a radical change in those rights and that they -- and I think very wisely, transformed their right from whatever it was, as has been mentioned before that, there was an appropriation from the river by a Mexican company which took the water down into Mexico and then the amount of water that the Mexicans didn't take flowed back northerly into the United States and was used in United -- in the Imperial Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.324" offset="20696691">They've heard the story of tremendous floods.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.602" offset="20705782">There were shortages in the dry months of the summer time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.494" offset="20729396">As a result of the construction of this complex of the storage reservoir in the Boulder Canyon, the Imperial Diversion Dam down below, the great All-American Canal there was created a new and different diversion from the river, and they were assured a constant supply of storage water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.904" offset="20846947">And, I would think that any decree that would be ultimately entered aligned with the Master's suggestion should reserve to that entity the amount by which they had a present perfected right at the time that the Act became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.370" offset="20940884">But in my opinion, the Metropolitan District does not fall in that category but, as they thought of it, there were some engineering work been done, it has been described by somebody as a gleam of somebody's eye but it certainly wasn't a perfected water right by any definition that I know of in the law of the western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.433" offset="21089155">Its -- it obtains its water by a contract from the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.893" offset="21122905">It is water that is stored in this project that was authorized by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.588" offset="21145684">I fail to see any inherent numbers between its contract rights and those of the State of Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.342" offset="21172746">By coincidence they are the only two that pay any money for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.337" offset="21192704">The -- but it was simply a contract right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.823" offset="21222693">Now, I think all of this is of materiality in assessing the impact of the Master's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.604" offset="21273788">He -- to cover it very briefly, upheld the validity of the California contracts within the boundaries of the limitation, the validity of the Arizona contract for 2.8 million acre-feet and that of Nevada, 0.3.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.375" offset="21384861">He provided that, in times of shortage, present perfected rights should be perfected or be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.681" offset="21418088">Even if it required taking the allotment from the other states and in doing that I believe that he fulfilled every priority that could be established as a priority as against the storage water in the dam in any suit and in any form under any rule that might be laid down.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.119" offset="21515891">As it had been mentioned, he provided, in times of shortage, first, there should be this proration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.874" offset="21538879">And it seems to me that that was a very logical and consistent thing to provide because, as it's been mentioned at length, what the flow of the stream is going to be is probably unknown to man.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.063" offset="21615574">The -- if -- when there is a shortage in the amount of water that emanates from that project then, to provide for this proration accompanied by the protection of the present perfected rights, I think everyone is protected that needed to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.589" offset="21709720">It hasn't created any threats or a fear against the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.722" offset="21734275">There is no evidence that anybody in California or the small present perfected rights on the Arizona side will be adversely affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.974" offset="21779310">I should mention in passing that it's very clear that these California rights have never been considered by anyone to have been preserved in their original character, what I'd call normal flow of rights or running the river rights which is all they could have been prior to the construction of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.804" offset="21890591">No one has ever suggested that that characteristic has been preserved since the construction of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.993" offset="21919326">Next, the situation that confronted the Court in these interstate streams such as Nebraska versus Wyoming, Colorado versus Kansas, and so forth, there, there were -- old rights were still being protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.169" offset="21976064">There were also rights for federally constructed reservoirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.748" offset="21994350">And, this question of the -- whether or not a right retains its original characteristic after the government comes in with a project was considered by the Court in the North Platte River.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.902" offset="22094973">And it's cited in our replied brief at page 24 United States versus Tilley, in which this Court denied certiorari and that case is of interest in pointing out what steps would've been necessary to followed if there had been in this last three decades, any thought or belief that there were some California prior rights being preserved as against the Secretary of the Interior in his right to stop the water in Lake Mead and hold it there unless and until it was discharged inconjuct -- in pursuance to the existing contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5539.215" offset="22260276">And that I believe, is the real test and that is I think where many of us have wondered astray perhaps in this sometimes academic discussion of priorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="5602.244" offset="22512306">Now, Nevas -- Nevada's basic position, however, has been that it is entitled to this 300,000 acre-feet allocation, under any theory upon which the case might be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5619.472" offset="22581269">We presented a volume of evidence and we think it is persuasive that as that portion of Nevada which as I mentioned earlier, is absolutely dependent upon the Colorado River for survival, if we even take the year 2000 as a cutoff, it would be an excess of the amount that is awarded in our contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.490" offset="22697357">If there was no contractual allocation scheme at all, let's make that assumption either permissive or mandatory in the Project Act and the Secretary had constructed the dam as he did and we were under general reclamation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.438" offset="22777083">It is our contention that that is a valid contract, that it must be taken into account and that in any court decree purporting to apportion or allocate the waters of river we would be entitled to that amount of water under that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.362" offset="22864854">Or if we go the whole way and assumed there was no allocation and it's being thrown open to the doc -- division of the water under this doctrine of equitable apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.710" offset="22918248">Then it is our contention that because of the situation of Nevada as a sovereign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.943" offset="22943117">And again accompanied by the contracts and the uses which we have initiated and, in each respect, expanding and growing, that an allocation of the like amount of water would be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.194" offset="23000168">The only point that I wish to mention very briefly under the general subject to the California limitation -- the California limitation is this, that it's been touched on I think by some who had preceded me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5742.775" offset="23074461">California says that there -- their admi -- their four million four is to come out not of the mainstream allocation from the project that the Secretary have created, but from a system wide pool in which the Gila of course, is the main contributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.988" offset="23171323">But when we come over to their rights under the water the million acre-feet allotted to the Lower Basin by Article III (b) of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.779" offset="23222523">They then do not read the Project Act literally because to the extent of the excess or surplus water in Section 4 (a) of the Project Act, California has given in addition to this four million four, plus not more than one-half of any excess or surplus waters unapportioned by said Compact not in excess of 3 (a) or anything at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.586" offset="23377690">And if you look to the Compact only has an aid in construing the Project Act, I find to believe that the Master, and perhaps very properly lean quite away over on the side of California in finding contrary to the position of Nevada and others that this 3 (b) water was not excess or surplus water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.460" offset="23501197">It seems to Nevada that the Master likewise was acting quite properly in providing to put in his decree for a future determination of these present perfected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.030" offset="23575489">I am inclined to think that perhaps Nevada was the one which initially requested that addition to his draft report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5878.701" offset="23618226">The reason for that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.913" offset="23639019">As I say, by -- I think there can be no denial that, under the Project Act, they're going to be given priority and, in assessing the future growth and development of that section of the river in that part of the United States, they must be taken to an account.</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.696" offset="23718118">It's our thought that any engineer that is going to determine the feasibility of water supply for new and additional projects must necessarily know the amount of water which had prior claims as present perfected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.577" offset="23801710">To take our Nevada situation, each time there is additional diversion of water, there -- it is necessary to install extensive and expensive pumping installation along pipelines and, obviously, any bankers that are going to put up any money are going have to be persuaded that there's water available and so also for the people who will be taxed for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5951.492" offset="23909334">And knowing that these rights are prior, it is quite vital to know the extent of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5960.265" offset="23944443">I think that the discussion this morning has cleared up a good deal of the question of what a present perfected right is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5970.859" offset="23986761">A perfected right is a well-known term in irrigation in the west as different from an in-court right or an initiated right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.075" offset="24019675">Appropriations sometimes is a pretty loose term.</text>
            <text syncTime="5982.339" offset="24032737">It has been used pretty broadly in various courts and various legislative body, but the term “perfected right” is certainly a definite and precise term and the addition of the word “present”, I think, was unique and intentional and required.</text>
            <text syncTime="6002.967" offset="24115284">It -- like as I mentioned earlier, originated in the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6007.447" offset="24133151">And from all the discussion, is whether -- one thing is obvious and that is that they were trying to get a cutoff at some time and to get that cutoff, it had to be something definite and certainly should not be something dangling out in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="6027.076" offset="24211728">If the Colorado River is typical of most of western streams, probably if we went up and down the stream there could be found at that time pending a multiplicity of notices of appropriation in the filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.798" offset="24266585">I think a mention has been made that there's someone in Arizona had made one up upstream above the reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.771" offset="24294484">And I have no doubt that there were many other all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.453" offset="24313187">Now, if we would taken an interpretation of the present perfected rights which would say that any right that came along in the future that was perfected, that was in existence at some time -- of some character that time, I think we destroy one of the fundamental aspects of the decision that was made by those who drew the Compact and by those who hammered up the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6083.904" offset="24438993">The -- it could even amount to opening the door to unlimited priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6092.251" offset="24472325">There has to be a cutoff somewhere on any kind of a water right determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6097.146" offset="24491969">It's inherent in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6142.816" offset="24674617">I think there had been some question raised about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.262" offset="24696456">The -- we think that the Secretary had the right to make these allocations that he made by contract and that they're valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="6158.381" offset="24736893">If for any reason, I can't foresee there'd be a contrary decision as to whether the Project Act told him to authorize him to make either as specific allocation or as Government counsel contend, a flexible authority to make allocations, certainly under the Project Act, anyone getting water out of that reservoir had to have a Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.753" offset="24854340">And under the General Reclamation Act, a contract is the basic scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="6194.505" offset="24881403">The -- in my opinion any valid right, for instance what the Metropolitan Water District has is a contract right and that if, for any variety of reasons it was decided that this case can not be decided under the allocation theory then I can not concede of any situation that would require to be thrown back into priority suit.</text>
