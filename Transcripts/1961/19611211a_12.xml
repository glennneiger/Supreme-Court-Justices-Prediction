            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 12, William A. Price, Petitioner, versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.530" offset="137488">Mr. Boudin.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="10.112" stopTime="1154.747">
            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="10.112" offset="143862">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.655" offset="153997">The petitioner, William Price, a reporter at the time on the New York Daily News, seeks review here of his conviction by the Court in the District of Columbia, Judge Keech, sitting without a jury under 2 U.S.C. 192.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.627" offset="237902">This is part of the same series of hearings, which are involved in the three preceding cases other than -- other than Russell and which was also the subject of an opinion by Judge Youngdahl in United States against Peck which deals with and disposes in our favor of the constitutional issues and which I will not discuss until the end of my argument on the more technical aspects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.489" offset="357334">Now, the petitioner here was called in both executive and public sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.242" offset="388368">The executive in December 1955, a public in January 1956 and the questions that were put to him were over a wide reach, covering such matters as his activities in a labor union of these paper men, that is his running for office, his knowledge of a particular young woman whose name appears in the record, his traveling as a pilot in an airplane, he'd been in the Navy in Latin America after the war and finally the usual question of Communist Party membership and meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.294" offset="560567">This was a very wide range as Your Honors will see when I point out that the subject matter of the inquiry was never indicated to this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.983" offset="595257">But what is particularly significant since the petitioner here has been indicted and convicted not for his appearance in December, 1955 but his appearance in January, 1956 is that the questions put to him, as developed by Mr. Rand upon the trial of his trial counsel, were identical in the executive session of December, 1955 and the public session of January, 1956, raising, therefore, the question which we do raise here Mr. Justice Harlan as to the legislative purpose of a second inquiry which is the only subject here of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.128" offset="759933">Now, I may say here that Your Honors will read the record of the executive as incorporated here and the public hearings to see that the petitioner denied all wrongdoing because various insinuations were made by the Government counsel -- by Committee counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.409" offset="832972">And Your Honors -- Honors will note that the petitioner did raise the question of legislative purpose not relying merely upon the arguments of conscience discussed by Mr. Justice Stewart in the Deutch case, did say why am I here, did say there is no legislative purpose and at no point, not only was the subject of -- not only was pertinency not showing, but at no point in this hearing was the subject matter indicated to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.096" offset="963793">Now, the petitioner, after being indicted by a jury composes as in the other cases, a majority of whom the Government employees, made the motions to dismiss the indictment which is set forth in the record and a motion was denied and also made -- served a subpoena duces tecum upon the Committee for the purpose of showing that there was no probable cause and no legislative purpose for subpoenaing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.099" offset="1079777">And that motion -- that subpoena duces tecum was quashed and the motion was denied and the petitioner proceeded to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.730" offset="1114258">At the trial, counsel for the Government insisted that the subject matter of inquiry was the total strategy and tactics of world communism and counsel for the Committee, to the extent that he testified on the subject and as the Government says correctly in its brief somewhat ambiguous testimony, the testimony that Government relied on, counsel for the Government again said it was world communism generally, but there is an exhibit introduced namely the full Committee hearings in which Senator Hennings as Your Honors will recall and one other Senator talked about the investigation of news media and so the Government here on appeal says, “No, it was not an investigation the world communism really.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.749" offset="1294399">It was an investigation of media”, although that is not consistent with Mr. Sourwine's testimony on this point at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.942" offset="1323133">The trial court in this case, whatever it maybe done and I don't recall what the activity the trial courts in these other cases, made no finding as to the subject matter of the inquiry except stated it was a proper inquiry and the Court of Appeals made no statement as to the subject matter of the inquiry so that we are compelled to rest upon these divergent points of view expressed by the Government here and by Mr. Sourwine below and by the record itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.376" offset="1448835">But, Your Honors will recall what I said before that at the time of the Committee hearing, assuming luminosity as that term is now used here to be important, the witness was not told the subject matter of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.273" offset="1504423">Now, we raise here in this short argument, the following points principally.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.385" offset="1524903">First, was there reasonable cause or legislative purpose or justification for calling Mr. Price, either at the executive session and certainly at the public session, which is the subject of his inquiry?</text>
            <text syncTime="371.584" offset="1589687">Secondly, assuming that the Government made or attempted to make a showing of such legislative purpose, was defense counsel here as in Liveright, permitted adequately to cross-examine Mr. Sourwine, the sole witness on this point and thirdly, was the subject matter of the inquiry shown to the witness at the time of the hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="394.438" offset="1681115">I may not reach this third point where the several others which are dealt with in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.496" offset="1701386">Now, as to probable cause, this is one of those unusual cases in which the Committee counsel admitted that they had no evidence placing Mr. Price in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.952" offset="1747153">In most cases, the claim was made, sometimes it's supported, here no such claim is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.065" offset="1775679">What then was the reason for calling Mr. Price, a reporter on a daily-news internationally known for its conservative events, if I may use that term?</text>
            <text syncTime="430.010" offset="1823431">Three reasons are given and we suggest to the Court that none of these reasons separately or cumulatively deserves -- deserve a subpoena by any rational approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.357" offset="1872750">First, that Mr. Price ran as a candidate on a newspaper guild slate for office which Mr. Sourwine, without a single word of evidence, a single claim of support except something like public repute said was a Communist slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.281" offset="1944534">I passed over the question of the effect on trade union elections if a man who runs for office can therefore be subpoenaed and come down merely to the question or whether that was a reasonable thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.485" offset="1989360">The second reason given by Mr. Sourwine is that the petitioner, the petitioner here knew this young woman whom that -- whom Mr. Sourwine testified was a Communist courier.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.980" offset="2067310">And these are very serious charges to make against anybody particularly by Committee counsel under the public privilege and I point out to Your Honors that there is not a word in this record to justify that kind of defamatory statement made as a justification for calling a newspaperman on the daily news.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.528" offset="2149439">More, more, the record here shows that the lady involved had testified before the same Committee six -- some months before and had not asserted privilege in answer to questions put to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.702" offset="2210147">This is Mr. Sourwine's statement at the end of his testimony, yet, this is argued as a reason for calling a newspaperman because he had some relationship rather with a young woman, not a reasonable thing at least for congressional committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.040" offset="2267512">Thirdly, and this I think is the most disturbing, Mr. Sourwine's said to Mr. Price, he believes, he didn't know, had joined in a statement printed in a Daily Worker, a Communist newspaper if Your Honors please, in defense of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.148" offset="2347969">Now, it is true, let's assume that, it is true that the statement as printed by the House of the American activities Committee in a volume which unfortunately is not in the record does say text to statement in defense of Communist Party, but if Your Honors will read the text of that statement and see who the signatories are, Your Honor will see that it was a 1941 statement, an appeal to the President of the United States and the Congress, not to the Daily Worker which happen to reprint it as they had a right to do I assume, and that wasn't our responsibility, an appeal to the President and Congress against the possibility of the Communist Party might be declared illegal and against, although what could this could do in this situation, I don't know, against such things as the Oklahoma (Inaudible) which as Your Honors may recall was being applied in 1940 to various members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.662" offset="2573981">This appeal is a most rational, honest decent appeal that anyone could -- could read as witnessed the fact that is, the signatories include Zechariah Chafee, Hocking, just was admitted to the Academy of Arts and Letters, one of a series of great honors, Professor Lehmann of the Union Theological Seminary, Francis Fisher Kane of Philadelphia, whom Your Honors know, the great lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.113" offset="2683800">These are the kind of people. It is very likely that Mr. Price who said he didn't recall having signed this, never signed it at all which he probably ought to be ashamed because the William Price here is the William Price of Swarthmore, Mr. Price has never been to Swarthmore, but this accident and as I say these were true and not justifies subpoena and with one of the three things that led to this man against whom the Committee had no information being subpoenaed.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.510" offset="2805426">Now, I come down to the question of let's assume all these, however, was very weighty and the committee did have this information and there might have been some evidence as to a curia, although Mr. Price's testimony on the curia issue and an involvement any conspiracy is very explicit in his denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.800" offset="2890585">We served a subpoena on the Government for the purpose of producing all information it had with respect to this young woman because it happened that she had testified before the Committee and completely exculpated herself and we asked for all information with respect to Mr. Price.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.254" offset="2960384">As I said before, the subpoena was quashed and when Mr. Rand attempted on penetrations to get information from Mr. Sourwine to justify what he had said on his direct examination to justify the calling of Mr. Price.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.589" offset="3033736">The trial court upheld his refusal to answer and the Government here says, “Well, the trial court only upheld the refusal to answer ten questions as if the number of questions was to be determined over the constitutional right to cross-examine a witness with respect to the testimony that he had given on direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.520" offset="3113462">This is no longer a First Amendment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.005" offset="3123388">This is a right -- is a normal right of the defendant in a criminal case to cross-examine with respect to what has been adduced on direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.227" offset="3156302">The trial judge merely said this is confidential testimony and the Government added to that upon this appeal a new argument and since probable cause says that Government was not an element of a crime, therefore we did not have a right to examine it because it was only an element of the right to call the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.789" offset="3254523">Now, if the Government will read Chief Judge Learned Hand's opinion in Andolschek which Mr. Rand referred to and United States against Copeland, the Government will see that whenever the Government has the information bearing upon the guilt, innocence or the right to prosecute a defendant or the right to introduce evidence against the defendant then the Government no longer has the right of confidence with respect to its records if they have any bearing on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.637" offset="3405928">And Judge Learned Hand in the United States against Copeland where Your Honors denied certiorari which did not involve an element to the crime but the question of whether the wiretap -- the records of the Government -- wiretapping records had led to the arrest of the defendant in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.120" offset="3483878">Very much like this in the sense sort of a reasonable cause except they're involved with the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.799" offset="3506552">Judge Learned Hand said, “It is however one thing to allow the privileged person to suppress the evidence and toto coelo, another thing to allow him to fill a gap in his own evidence by recourse to what he suppresses.”</text>
            <text syncTime="864.764" offset="3562454">Yes, Mr. Sourwine was -- was stating what he had as facts and would not allow us to go in to it and Judge Learned Hand said, “The prosecution must decide whether the public prejudice of allowing the crime to go unpunished was greater than the disclosure of such “state secrets,” that was espionage Your Honors, you'll recall, such state secrets as might be relevant to defense, that was a felony, that was espionage, this is a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.006" offset="3675408">And finally, Judge Learned Hand said and this Court knows this language I am sure, “Few weapons in the arsenal of freedom are more useful than the power to compel a Government to disclose the evidence on which it seeks to forfeit the liberty of its citizens.”</text>
            <text syncTime="910.314" offset="3744580">Now, we come last in the next two minutes to the question of luminosity.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.460" offset="3773210">Did we ask -- did we raise the issue of pertinency, the issue of right of the Committee to ask?</text>
            <text syncTime="923.518" offset="3797452">The Government says, “We didn't use the word “pertinency.”</text>
            <text syncTime="927.180" offset="3812080">Well, I submit that neither did Mr. Watkins as Your Honor will see buried in his statement was a reference to the fact that he hasn't -- see how these things are relevant, but basically, he was challenging the power of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.507" offset="3857429">I'm sure this Court did not mean in the majority opinion written by the Chief Justice to lay down a strict rule that the word of pertinency must be used otherwise the Committee has no duty to state the subject matter or the respects in which the matter is pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.160" offset="3920018">And in Deutch, there Mr. Justice Stewart's opinion dealt with a very narrow thing, a man came forth and said, “My conscience does not let me answer the information.”</text>
            <text syncTime="963.694" offset="3958157">He didn't challenge the power of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.540" offset="3969546">We challenged the power of the Committee when we said there is no legislative purpose in your inquiry committee, so to intact where Judge Youngdahl acquitted Seymour Pat.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.113" offset="4011865">Here, we rely upon what the Chief Justice said in Quinn against United States, Mr. Justice Harlan concurring in that aspect of the Court's opinion part 1 where the Chief Justice said, involving the Fifth Amendment, “There is no ritualistic or talismanic formula necessary to invoke the Fifth Amendment” and what the Chief Justice said there we apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.317" offset="4112593">If the Committee was in any doubt as to subject matter -- as to the meaning of the witness' objections stated in five different ways, “All it had to do” as the Chief Justice said, “was to ask the witness whether he was challenging the Committee's power,” but nobody was under any doubt as to whether the witness was in fact challenging the Committee power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.322" offset="4192632">Your Honors will read this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.659" offset="4197961">Your Honors will see that what the Committee was concerned about was one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.750" offset="4218337">“Mr. Price,” they said, “Are you sure you're not pleading the Fifth Amendment?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.636" offset="4241951">That was all I wanted to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.193" offset="4248116">They didn't care whether he was pleading pertinency, legislative purpose, Committee jurisdictional power, just to be sure that the Fifth Amendment was not being involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.318" offset="4284688">I don't go in to the question of Committee's motivation on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.158" offset="4300048">I merely say hereto the Committee was very able to see that there was a direct challenge to its power and in this record with the varied number of subjects covered in the Committee hearing, the Committee had to tell the witness what the subject matter was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.342" offset="4372773">I may add one more footnote, what I have said is a dependence upon Deutch, the dependence upon the Chief Justice's opinion even if narrowly construed in Watkins, but I do not think that a witness whatever maybe his duty to state the subject matter -- to state his objections to -- on pertinency grounds when pertinency is a problem has any duty before a congressional committee if the Committee is silent upon the principle substratum of this investigation namely, subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.102" offset="4499832">When the Committee states subject matter, the witness maybe under certain circumstances, I'm not prepared to -- can see all cases now may waive, but the witness can never waive his right to know what the Committee is investigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.844" offset="4550719">And if the Court will read sometimes again as it must occasionally -- such cases as Sinclair, the Court will see that in Sinclair that there is no question as to what the Committee was investigating in detailed discussion that it had with counsel who appeared and was permitted to talk if I recall him there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.193" offset="4624175">The Committee indicated subject and finally, the Court will examine the indictment in Sinclair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.803" offset="4650611">It will see a 22-page indictment in detail, explaining the subject matter of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.402" offset="4681017">I don't wonder that in this case those subject matters of inquiry were indicated in the indictment because none was stated in the Committee hearing.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. William Doolittle, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1159.200" offset="4740159">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.534" offset="4757504">I will try to deal with all the points covered by the petitioner and first to the point that he dealt with in most detailed last and that's the subject under inquiry and pertinency of the questions to that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.376" offset="4812884">Now, it is the Government's contention that the subject under inquiry was in fact proved to be Communist infiltration into the news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.931" offset="4847052">And the basic reasons as far as the hearings as a whole are concerned are those that I stated in arguing the Whitman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.180" offset="4876100">Here, however, it is very important for the Court to realize that at trial counsel for the petitioner repeatedly conceded that the subject under inquiry is precisely what I've said that it is, Communist infiltration into news media and we've set forth the citations and some of the quotations of those concessions at pages 27 and 28 of our brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.222" offset="4976306">Moreover, the whole premise of petitioner's argument which he makes most vigorously in his brief that this whole hearing constituted an unwarranted attack on the free press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.970" offset="5023222">The whole premise of that argument is that these hearings were in fact concerned with Communist infiltration into news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.718" offset="5058226">After this, I should like to advert to one point that petitioner does make in his brief that is a seemingly inconsistent remark by subcommittee counsel part of which is quoted in the petitioner's brief at page 25 here and which is set out in more detail in the Whitman brief at page 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.486" offset="5173269">That statement which as I say is referred to by counsel here and has been referred to by counsel and some of the other cases, is to the effect that Mr. Sourwine, the subcommittee counsel, denied that infiltration of the press was the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.912" offset="5263026">Now, to understand that remark it must be appreciated that there had been public statements to the effect that these hearings were an attack upon the free press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.547" offset="5297612">The subcommittee was most sensitive to this charge as I think we would all agree and rightly should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.834" offset="5326660">And their concern was evidenced by statements that I have referred to in prior arguments made both by the Chairman of the Committee and by Senator Hennings particularly at page 1588 of the hearing record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.604" offset="5389772">Now, it is quite clear from the context that in making of the remark that counsel had referred to here, the subcommittee counsel thought whether he was reasonable and thinking so or not, but the subcommittee counsel thought that the Committee was then being charged with an attack on the free press and his denial goes to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.880" offset="5474931">It's particularly obvious that this must be so since he went on to state that the chairman has already told you that that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.931" offset="5507114">Well, the only thing that the chairman had already told anyone was that this was not an attack on the free press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.452" offset="5533132">I might point out that in any event, petitioner was not present when this remark was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.365" offset="5552880">It goes only to the question of what the subject under inquiry in fact was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.233" offset="5576286">Now, as to the appraisal of the petitioner, that raises of course of the subject matter and pertinency, our contention is that the witness did not object to this at the hearing and that under both Watkins and Barenblatt, a witness must make a specific objections on these grounds in order for it to be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.282" offset="5668551">The statement that he made, again, a lengthily legal memorandum, was clearly insufficient under Barenblatt where roughly the same kind of legal memorandum was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.372" offset="5716825">And we understand from what petitioner says at page 29 of his brief that in essence he conceives that this is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.605" offset="5749844">I read the bottom of page 29 of his brief as largely conceding that no objection was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.550" offset="5777533">In any event, we believe that he was satisfactorily appraised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.011" offset="5795401">The witness ahead of him who appeared was a newsman, who was questioned about his party affiliations and about infiltration into the typographical union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.784" offset="5838555">The petitioner was asked some preliminary questions concerning -- concerned primarily with his newspaper background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.461" offset="5861230">As far as the pertinency of the questions are concerned, counsel at trial conceded that at least counts one, two and eight are pertinent to an investigation of communist infiltration of news media and that concession appears at pages 291 and 292 of the trial transcript in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.336" offset="5952763">Now, on the basis for calling the petitioner before the subcommittee, petitioner raises this question generally and also in a context of his effort to subpoena subcommittee records not only on petitioner but on other -- on one other person, and also to his efforts to cross-examine with respect to confidential informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.476" offset="6049311">Now, we contend that neither at the hearing nor at the trial did petitioner rebut the presumption of regularity in the subcommittee's calling the petitioner so as to bring its basis for doing so into issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.464" offset="6113259">However, we do believe that the record is perfectly plain that petitioner was not called as a result of indiscriminate dragnet procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.708" offset="6158190">As counsel has pointed out, subcommittee counsel gave sworn testimony as to the information on the basis of which petitioner was called.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.551" offset="6193612">Now, I would like to point out that counsel did omit a little bit of the information that counsel testified was a part of the basis for he's being called.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.011" offset="6239378">We -- incidentally, the initial -- the basis for he's being called in the first place as testified to by subcommittee counsel at trial is set forth on page 5 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.168" offset="6288071">And I would want to point out that among the things that were involved were information that petitioner after returning from war time naval service had flown an airplane on a trip to Central and South America during which time he is accompanied by a courier for the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.739" offset="6358288">Then subcommittee counsel as -- as counsel for petitioner has pointed out, petitioner was called before an executive session and then after some time had elapsed, he was called before an open session.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.190" offset="6412100">Now, on pages 6 and 7 of our brief, we have set forth the information or I should say the reasons stated by subcommittee counsel at the trial as to why petitioner was recalled in open session after he had refused to answer questions in executive session.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.485" offset="6497364">And in essence, the reasons there stated are that the Committee had had experience in the past that some times a witness after being -- being given a chance to think it over did decide to answer the questions and that from the very -- the demeanor of the witness, they felt that they had reason to believe that he had information, that he might be willing to disclose at a later time, as I say this is set forth on pages 6 and 7 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.349" offset="6608750">Subcommittee counsel did submit to cross-examination on such things as when the various information that the subcommittee had that was received and in what form, but here again, while it appeared that the Court might be willing to allow cross-examination along the same general lines, the Court did draw the line at the request of the Government that requiring the subcommittee counsel to disclose the confidential informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.653" offset="6722017">Therefore, the information on which the subcommittee did base its calling of the petitioner is as an in prior cases substantially the same as this Court did regard in Barenblatt as having been sufficient to rebut the notion that petitioner there was called as a result of any indiscriminate dragnet procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.738" offset="6814281">Now, one point that has been raised and a number of these cases that has not yet been dealt with and I should like to deal with briefly at this point is one of the indictment points and that is the question of whether or not the indictment had to allege willfulness because that issue is in a number of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.676" offset="6894111">Now, the statute that is involved here, 2 U.S.C. 192 does not contain any statement, willful or otherwise, concerning state of mind that is required to be proved in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.022" offset="6943431">However, this Court in the Quinn case, 349 U.S. 155 said that it is a deliberate intentional refusal to answer that is required in these instances and the indictment in this case as in several of the others alleged unlawfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.034" offset="7015528">Now, the only court which is the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia that has directly focused on this question has repeatedly said that this is enough, that is to say that the word “lawfully” is enough, particularly, particularly, since the very word “refusal” which of course is in all of these, itself imports a deliberate intentional act now which of course is what is required under the Quinn case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.019" offset="7123466">Now, petitioner has in oral argument hinted at, but in his brief exten -- extensively argued his contention that this hearing and the hearings of which it was a part constituted a violation of the First Amendment because there was an investigation of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.779" offset="7214477">Now, the fourth estate is not immune to investigation simply because it is the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.445" offset="7237151">Other fields that are protected by the First Amendment have been held subject to investigation such as education in the Barenblatt case, propaganda in the Braden and Wilkinson cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.113" offset="7283858">And the statements of this Court made in the Barenblatt case I think are particularly applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.922" offset="7303084">I have adverted to them before, the notion that an educational institution is not a constitutional sanctuary from inquiry in to matters that may otherwise be within the constitutional legislative domain merely for the reason that inquiries made of someone within its walls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.527" offset="7365465">And further that, we think the investigatory power in this domain is not to be denied to Congress solely because the field of education is involved and we submit that no less is true of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.858" offset="7414784">Furthermore, in this case, there is simply no basis for the assertion that it was the free press as such that was being investigated rather than communist infiltration in news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.992" offset="7467342">The chairman and Senator Hennings expressly disavowed any purpose to investigate the press as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.221" offset="7496286">Their statements at -- in the hearings at pages 1588 and 1717 to 1718 are most impressive in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.589" offset="7533693">And I note that this Court in the Barenblatt case relied on similar statements to answer the contention that the education that the content of the classroom as such was being investigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.740" offset="7598373">The questions that were asked in these hearings of petitioner and of the other witnesses that appeared, probed in to the witnesses' positions, their activities, their associations, not what they wrote, not the content of the newspapers for which they worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.730" offset="7662320">The hearings themselves were pursuant to Winston Burdett's testimony that the Communists had in fact infiltrated news media and the Committee was following up that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.270" offset="7708400">Finally, the Court of Appeals found to the contrary in this case, that's at page 4 of the record, by reference to its opinion in the Shelton case which in turn is at page 242 of the Shelton record where it said, “This inquiry was in no sense an investigation into the press as such, but into the question whether the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press was being used to undermine that very freedom and the foundation on which it rests.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.036" offset="7843506">Now, one further point is made with respect to the authority of the subcommittee in this case and that is the contention that whatever the reach of Senate Resolution 366, it does not -- Congress did not intend that news media be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.350" offset="7928769">Of course, it was similarly contended in the Barenblatt case that Congress could not have intended that a subcommittee or a committee be authorized to investigate education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.346" offset="7968789">And of course, the Court rejected that argument for reasons that are equally applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.174" offset="7992090">There is no indication whatever that Congress intended to exclude the press from the authority that it gave to the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and certainly that is an area that is no less sensitive than education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.791" offset="8054575">Furthermore, the Senate clearly approved of this particular phase of the subcommittee's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.034" offset="8079548">The subcommittee had conducted hearings on Communist activities in radio and television and non-Communist propaganda, these are cited at pages 26 and 27 of our brief in the Liveright case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.114" offset="8127822">Furthermore with full knowledge of the instant hearings which have been reported to them in Senate Report 1385 of the 84th Congress, Senator -- the Senate appropriated a large sum with which the subcommittee was to continue these very hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.330" offset="8192711">Now, we submit that there cannot be any serious contention that these hearings were authorized by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.192" offset="8220191">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2334.723" offset="9442304">When Senator Hennings tried to separate himself a little bit from this subcommittee upon which he found himself, I think for the first time of his life, the Internal Security Subcommittee, he having devoted himself to the protection of civil liberties on another subcommittee, this judiciary committee when he said this is not an effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.741" offset="9518373">This is not an attack upon any one newspaper, but an effort on the part of this Committee to show an attempt -- I'm leaving out a few words, in the Communist Party, the influence or to subvert the American press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.327" offset="9568632">Now, I suggest Your Honors that the remark was made that an investigation of the press is proper in order to protect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.251" offset="9596426">It's exactly the thing that will undermine a free press and whenever the Government moves in, whether in this Country or the Soviet Union or in Nazi Germany or elsewhere for the purpose of determining what the press shall say or who shall work on it, it is subverting what we understand in this country to be freedom of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.429" offset="9673122">And it may look better when it happens to the United States and the Senate Committee uses these words, “But it is no better no matter what country under which it is done.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.321" offset="9708648">Now, I turn to the second point in the last couple of minutes and say to Your Honor's question, Mr. Chief Justice, no information was given to Mr. Price when he appeared before the Committee as to charges against him, questions were put but he was not told.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.789" offset="9782523">I think I'm fair in my reading of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.979" offset="9791300">We have information that X was a communist courier and went with you on this trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.417" offset="9817004">Secondly, when Mr. Price -- when Mr. Sourwine appeared at the trial, Mr. Sourwine never claimed that any such information had been given to Mr. Price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.976" offset="9871235">I want also to indicate Your Honors that we do not see how this whole series of cases like Grosjean and Rumely and Hannegan are consistent with what was done in the present situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.308" offset="9928600">And the time is too short for me to analyze the argument but we refer Your -- Your Honors to our briefs on this point on the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.976" offset="9959320">Thank you Your Honors.</text>
