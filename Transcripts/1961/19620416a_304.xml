            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Alioto</label>
            <text syncTime="37.096" offset="251800">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.535" offset="265488">This case is here from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.978" offset="287326">It is a private action under the antitrust laws, that was tried in the District Court in San Francisco before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.337" offset="320763">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant and the Court ended its judgement on that verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.960" offset="359215">We contended in the Court of Appeals that that verdict was the product of manifest errors that had certainly been manifested by the time the Court got to the -- the time the case got to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.684" offset="410102">Notably, the defendants in that case, the respondents here, had gambled and lost on what this Court was going to do in the Klor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.558" offset="449599">May I ask the Court to give the Klor instruction at time that that case was before the Ninth Circuit?</text>
            <text syncTime="92.744" offset="474363">Addition to that, when we asked the trial judge to give the Bigelow Instruction, the trial judge stated in all seriousness that somebody has to start reversing the Supreme Court and he didn't propose to give the Bigelow instruction because he didn't agree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.997" offset="539355">He thought that the -- a more stringent rule should apply in antitrust cases and even in most cases with respect to the measurement of the damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.250" offset="572374">In addition to that, the Court held that the respondents here, acting through a Canadian subsidiary, have a right to eliminate the petitioners from their Canadian business to takeaway their Canadian business entirely because the subsidiary of the respondents was acting as a purchaser under authority of the Canadian Government, and it was felt that the American Banana doctrine in some way permitted them to do this with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.220" offset="708211">In this posture of the case, the Court of Appeals completely avoiding -- avoided having to meet this problem by stating that it would consider all of the evidence even that that was excluded under the American Banana theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.321" offset="768606">But that taking all of the evidence in its best like, it felt that it would grant the conspiracy to monopolize had been proved and grant there was economic evidence in the case, relevant economic data to justify a measurement of damages, and grant there was a failure here of petitioners to get a foothold in this business, that with all of that the evidence didn't establish and there was no evidence that could have gone to the jury on the issue of whether or not the respondents had caused this failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.680" offset="910085">And so, it said on that basis that since there was no evidence to go to the jury on the issue of legal causation that it didn't have to consider the manifest errors that were in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.135" offset="959927">This Court granted certiorari and the questions we are here to discuss is whether or not under the circumstances where a violation and a rather flagrant violation as in this case is admitted and where the respondents in this case directly said that they intended to eliminate these petitioners and to prevent them from getting a foothold in this industry, there was direct evidence on that, when that is the situation whether the Court can takeaway from a jury the question of legal causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.171" offset="1100048">The second question we have here on certiorari is whether or not the Court was correct in the -- in excluding the evidence predicated upon the American Banana case and third, whether the action of the Court of Appeals deprived these petitioners of a right to trial by jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.284" offset="1180505">The case went to the jury and the verdict was in favor of the respondents in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.801" offset="1202552">We contended it was the product of these errors that we had mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.963" offset="1215195">The Court of Appeals avoided meeting these errors of all by this device that saying there was no legal causation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Alioto</label>
            <text syncTime="286.263" offset="1248423">I would think under the circumstances particularly with respect to the American Banana theory that was employed by the Court of the case could be sent down to the District Court directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.131" offset="1303907">But this I think is an unresolved question under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.645" offset="1317909">The closest we get to that is the Story Parchment situation where it was contended that that case should have been sent back to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.819" offset="1354689">The Supreme Court said that under the circumstances, it had enough of the record before it to see that there was error, they couldn't be handled in that fashion, that it was simply send it -- simply reverse the Court of Appeals and send it back to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.139" offset="1403904">Now, the difference between the cases is, Mr. Justice Harlan, that in the Story Parchment case, the petitioners won the jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.924" offset="1443088">In this case, they lost it.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="336.579" offset="1449671">Is it a difference?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_l_alioto" startTime="338.799" stopTime="837.638">
            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Alioto</label>
            <text syncTime="338.799" offset="1458552">It is a difference, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.584" offset="1465657">However, when you -- when you analyze what has been done here, I think it's perfectly plain that it's not necessary to send this case back to the Court of Appeals to determine that this Court in fact overruled the Klor case and the Klor instruction was given in this case, and it got the series in this case, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.763" offset="1538382">You recall the Klor doctrine as it was being handled in the Ninth Circuit held that you can deliberately eliminate a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.228" offset="1572237">But that, if after you eliminate him, the public still can be served by what remains in the industry that that didn't constitute a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.522" offset="1605465">In this case, in the context of this case, since two respondents had 100% of this industry, it meant that they could with impunity eliminate a competitor so long as they themselves still have enough to serve the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.376" offset="1668890">Now, on the context of this case, I think it will be an idle act to send this back to the Court of Appeals and go directly to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.979" offset="1695326">However, if it went to the Court of Appeals, I think it's clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.229" offset="1704312">They would have to say that the Klor case was error and that the trial court's contempt of this Court in its statement that it didn't -- it proposed to start reversing the Supreme Court in refusing to give the Bigelow doc -- the Bigelow instruction that in view of that situation, we respectfully submit that it would be more practical under the circumstances to send it back to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.172" offset="1800025">Now, when the Court of Appeals decided if there wasn't enough evidence on causation to send this case to the jury, it still hadn't closed the entire gap because it had the manifest elimination of the Canadian business, a petitioner's Canadian business.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.920" offset="1863032">And so, it said with respect to that, that since the business was eliminated and since this business was taken away from petitioners by a subsidiary of one of respondents which was acting at the time as a purchasing agent for Canada, that since that was done, this Court's decision in the Noerr case prevented any antitrust liability from arising from that set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.244" offset="1976299">So, what the Court of Appeals did, we respectfully submit, was first of all, take away the case from the jury when there was manifestly a factual conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.438" offset="2005138">And, secondly, it misapplied this Court's decision in the Noerr case to hold it under no circumstances can a governmental agency be used for the purpose of furthering the objectives of a monopoly as distinct from serving the very purposes of the agency itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.815" offset="2078595">Now, after this case came down from the Ninth Circuit, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed with modification certain judgements in companion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.797" offset="2134601">We bring this to the attention of the Court because I think it supports our view that manifestly, there were two inferences, that there was some resolutions of facts that had to be made by a trier of the facts because the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in affirming the judgements in the companion cases is inconsistent with the view that under no circumstances could you find antitrust liability here.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.681" offset="2234075">There was in this case, and it's admitted by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit or assumed by it for the purpose of this case, a comprehensive scheme to monopolize every facet of the Vanadium Industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.843" offset="2286738">The commodity involved was Vanadium-bearing rock which also contained Uranium in the ratio of six to one and the locale of these things, the locale of the mining was on the Colorado Plateau.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.286" offset="2336475">There were three forms of the commodity involved in the action, First, the ore itself, secondly the vanadium oxide and third, the ferrovanadium.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.558" offset="2385586">There was direct evidence, indeed a confession by a former Vice President of the United States Vanadium Corporation that the corporations here intended to monopolize every face of the industry and they were instructed to fair about competition wherever it might arise or to determine what claims or determine what business might form the nucleus for a competitive operation and to remove it and pursuant to this, they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.620" offset="2497808">It was a remarkably successful conspiracy to monopolize, resulting in 100% of the ferrovanadium industry, the respondents acquiring 90% of the domestic industry on vanadium oxide, and the respondents milling in their mills 90% of the ore from their own properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.079" offset="2579728">There is no dispute in the evidence that the respondents, by simple agreement, fixed the price that they were to pay to the miners for the ore.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.583" offset="2609716">There's no dispute in the evidence that they fixed the price of the vanadium oxide and no dispute that they fixed the price of the ferrovanadium.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.519" offset="2645452">There was a division of markets between them based on percentages and based on specific customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.865" offset="2666872">There was an agreement not to solicit each other's customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.926" offset="2683068">They cooperate in connection with the exploitation of certain claims to the extent that one respondent mine the claims of the other respondent, and there was an agreement between them that they would eliminate all competitive threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.150" offset="2740015">Now, so far as these petitioners are concerned, these petitioners or the principal petitioner involved here is a man named Henry J Leir, who came to this country in 1938 from Germany and from Europe where it had an extensive experience in connection with the purchase of raw materials for manufacturing ferroalloys.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.861" offset="2822771">In that European experience, he had developed certain processes which produced a superior type vanadium.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.570" offset="2845654">This all has to be admitted for the purposes of this -- for the purposes of the -- hearing this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.345" offset="2876792">His vanadium contained approximately 80% of the vanadium content of 80%.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.353" offset="2892779">In addition to that, he had developed a vanadium oxide with certain other agents which could be introduced directly into the steel bath.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.945" offset="2927156">The principal uses of vanadium were in the steel industry for the purpose of toughening the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.765" offset="2954428">So, he came in 1938 and made certain contracts for the production of ferrovanadium in this Country.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.301" offset="2988596">The evidence in the case disclosed, and this was from a former Vice President of the United States Vanadium Corporation, that both Union Carbide and the Vanadium Corporation of America, the two respondents in this action, that both of them directly intended to keep these petitioners from gaining any kind of a position in the vanadium industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.593" offset="3085772">The evidence on this was direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.427" offset="3097057">It is the Vice President of the United States Vanadium Company admitted it and he admitted to a conversation with the President of the Vanadium Corporation of America when a certain project was being discussed to take uranium from the ore without having the vanadium milled at the same time and the President of the Vanadium Corporation of America, one of the respondents, says that that would permit this petitioner to get into business, and this is exactly what we have been trying to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.471" offset="3209279">The evidence discloses, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.273" offset="3216488">A joint refusal by these folks who have 100% of the ferrovanadium industry and 90% of the vanadium oxide industry, a joint refusal to deal to petitioner or to sell to petitioner and this, in times when burdening circumstances were being handled by both organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.223" offset="3292244">In addition to that, they interfered with his source of supply, one of the millers on the Colorado Plateau, named Nisley &amp; Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.530" offset="3321501">Now, since the action of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has affirmed a judgement in favor of Nisley &amp; Wilson and that judgement had implicit in it the fact that they were eliminated by these respondents pursuant to a conspiracy to monopolize the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.280" offset="3396524">Nisley &amp; Wilson, as the Court of Appeals' opinion discloses for the chief source of supply for these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.545" offset="3421602">So, it was found by the jury in Salt Lake and affirmed by the court in Denver that they had been eliminated and there were sufficient facts to sustain that judgement.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="837.638" offset="3453889">Was it a private antitrust action?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Alioto</label>
            <text syncTime="838.936" offset="3459114">That was a private antitrust action by Nisley &amp; Wilson and the private antitrust action also by the miners resulted in a judgement for the miners, which even upon modifications for something like $1.5 million, and that was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.380" offset="3516897">In the government action which preceded this, the action was brought in 1946 and tried sometime in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.102" offset="3547826">The delay was occasioned by the fact that it was alleged that national security was somehow involved because of the presence of uranium in the vanadium-bearing ore, and that government action resulted in the acquittal of these defendants but the government action, stayed -- under the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, stayed the statute of limitations for enough time so that we could go back to these earlier acts and the jury found for the miners in Salt Lake City, found for Nisley &amp; Wilson and found for certain of a -- certain members of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.569" offset="3677602">It was all those who mined on the Colorado Plateau.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.343" offset="3688782">And, we say that the affirmance by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, proves -- on suspectedly the same record, proves that there is a factual conflict that candid -- that ought to be resolved by a fact-finder, a trier of the fact, rather than by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.869" offset="3754820">Now, in addition to all of these things, the Court of Appeals admitted some concern with the fact that where you prove an intent to eliminate a particular competitor, followed by the elimination of that competitor, that under Bigelow and Story Parchment and Eastman Kodak that that would have to be determined by a jury, that that was circumstantial evidence from which a jury could make the finding as to whether or not legal causation existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.636" offset="3877909">It admitted some misgivings with those cases and simply went on to distinguish the Bigelow case on the theory that Bigelow involved the defection of a great number of customers and this involved a more limited number of suppliers, a more limited number of customers with whom these petitioners were working.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.571" offset="3941648">And we submit that that is no distinction at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.130" offset="3955858">But furthermore, the Court didn't even try to distinguish the Story Parchment case and the Kodak case when it recognized that this principle existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.109" offset="3991803">Then it went on, as I say, without being able to close the gap entirely to hold that the Canadian transaction, the elimination of these petitioners from the Canadian market was done by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.014" offset="4047391">It admitted it was done for the purpose -- it assumed it was done for the purpose of entrenching the monopoly which existed but said, because of the Noerr case, it was unable to find or to predicate any antitrust liability upon that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.425" offset="4105070">It's a little different than the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.160" offset="4111966">The trial court had granted them impunity from this action, this total elimination from the Canadian market on the basis of the American Banana decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.030" offset="4147493">The Court of Appeals placed it on the basis of the Noerr decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.091" offset="4163688">Now, here's a factual situation so far as that Canadian market is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.248" offset="4184377">No Canadian official was made a defendant in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.391" offset="4196916">No Canadian official was being proceeded against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.912" offset="4211022">The defendants did have a Canadian subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.731" offset="4222307">It was a commercial subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.090" offset="4231711">During the war, this commercial subsidiary was appointed by the Canadian Government as an agent to purchase vanadium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.425" offset="4265044">We alleged and we offer to prove, and the offer of proof was rejected, but the Court of Appeals said it would -- and retain or regard or consider the offer of proof in connection with this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.794" offset="4306526">We alleged that, immediately upon being appointed the agent for the Canadian Government, that the Canadian subsidiary or the respondent, Union Carbide, joined with Union Carbide and VCA and they agreed they will cut the petitioner off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.773" offset="4366503">The petitioner, in the meantime, had developed a rather substantial business on shipments from Long Island, New York into Canada with the Atlas Steel Company and other companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.352" offset="4404746">He was forbidden under this arrangement, except for a few shipments after he had established the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.008" offset="4427421">He was forbidden to sell them to Canada at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.771" offset="4442467">Instead, the agent for the Canadian Government which was a subsidiary of these respondents, that agent purchased the vanadium from the two respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.290" offset="4484577">In other words, they split the orders that he had in Canada, the business he had in Canada between these two respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.547" offset="4509550">And the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit felt that the Noerr case somehow compelled this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.794" offset="4534523">Now, that same question came before the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and it went just the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.288" offset="4560541">The trial court in the Tenth Circuit case -- cases rather, the trial court instructed the jury that if a governmental agency were used in a commercial transaction for the purpose of assisting or furthering the objects of a conspiracy to monopolize, that no immunity was gained by the governmental agent if he joined that conspiracy in effect or used his powers to further that conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.748" offset="4662314">The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit considered the question in two different categories and in two different factual situations and it analyzed it in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.940" offset="4703169">It said that if the government agent had a discretionary power to buy from any number of people or had discretionary power to engage in commercial transactions and that government agent exercised his discretion so as to assist a monopolization or a restraint of trade, then the government agency gained no immunity or the government agent gained no immunity by reason of that government agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.417" offset="4812988">Now, here's a factual situation they were talking about in that situa -- in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.851" offset="4834826">Union Carbide was appointed as a procuring agency by the United States Government for vanadium and uranium at a certain period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.116" offset="4879862">Union Carbide was authorized -- the respondent, Union Carbide, was authorized to pay the miners anything up to 50 cents a pound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.435" offset="4917164">Union Carbide and Vanadium Corporation of America have agreed among themselves in private meetings, as so far as their own purchases were concerned for their own account that they would pay the miners, first, 21 cents and then they fixed a base price of 31 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.234" offset="4972335">They were authorized in buying for the Government in the war program to pay up to 50 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.162" offset="4996054">So, the evidence proved and this was accepted the Tenth Circuit and affirmed by the Tenth Circuit, the evidence proved that they took their governmental power and fixed the price in accordance with their private agreement, with the agreement that they had made privately among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.890" offset="5054882">And so, the Court of Appeals says that, by using that discretion to get into a combination to restrain trade to fix prices in this case, that the governmental agency afforded them no immunity whatever, and this is the analysis which the Court has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.019" offset="5111411">In another action where certain claims were taken away, this again is in the Tenth Circuit, certain claims were taken away containing valuable uranium lands, the Court of Appeals said, “In that case, the Government directed Union Carbide to take those very claims and therefore the governmental agency could not be used as a basis for predicating antitrust liability.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.594" offset="5205765">Now, we when get back to the factual situation we have in this case, this is what developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.531" offset="5225514">The petitioner was shipping a product called Van-Ex, that's a vanadium oxide for direct introduction into the steel bath, from New York -- a little factory it had in New York to Canada to the Atlas Steel Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.832" offset="5278699">When the shipment was cut-off, the petitioner protested in Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.393" offset="5300955">In Canada, he was told to see a Union Carbide agent in New York City, a managing agent -- admittedly a managing agent of New -- of Union Carbide in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.682" offset="5350066">So, he went to see this managing agent in New York or rather he was called by another man in Union Carbide who was not an officer and told to appear at an office in Union Carbide for a discussion of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.515" offset="5405445">When they got there, this agent of Union Carbide told the petitioner that they had no right in the vanadium business in Canada or the United States, and he also told them he had heard they were making certain arrangements with the Climax Molybdenum Company and that he should stay away from Climax and, if he didn't, that Union Carbide would use some of its molybdenum which it had in California and surplus supply for the purpose of visiting reprisals on Climax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.570" offset="5517667">Now, all of this was excluded by the trial judge on the theory that, somehow, Canadian sovereignty inter -- intervened, and the American Banana decision compelled this exclusion of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.077" offset="5563643">And the trial judge also instructed the jury that the -- that no act done on behalf of the Government of Canada could possibly predict -- could possibly be the basis for antitrust liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.165" offset="5615992">Let's say the Court of Appeals didn't put it on this basis, but put it on the basis of the Noerr case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.006" offset="5647444">Now, another factual -- we insist that what the Court of Appeals actually did here was to waive facts to appraise inferences and to make a resolution of both facts and inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.303" offset="5696554">But one of the things the Court of Appeals said was this, "We will grant that 90% of this industry may have been monopolized by these two defendants and we will grant that these two defendants by agreement, jointly refused to supply the petitioners for vanadium oxide to manufacture ferrovanadium or to export as vanadium oxide or to manufacture their Van-Ex, which was a vanadium oxide for direct introduction into the steel bath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.771" offset="5810448">We will grant that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.114" offset="5815777">But if 10% was on the outside and he could have had access to that 10% and didn't take the 10% on the outside then there can be no question of causing the damage to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.557" offset="5873560">The petitioner caused the damage to himself by not taking that 10%.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.731" offset="5890278">The problem about that is, that part of that 10% was being supplied by Nisley &amp; Wilson who at the very time were being proceeded against were the victims of a campaign to eliminate them and they were eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.026" offset="5943463">And the evidence is in the record that they were eliminated as a result of this campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.336" offset="5960704">As I say in Nisley &amp; Wilson's private suit, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit said there was a factual foundation for this elimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.420" offset="5989021">I think that that proves on its face that there was a factual conflict which a trier of the fact should have resolved instead of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.934" offset="6023084">In addition to that, this other portion, this other 10% was in -- was an undependable supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.964" offset="6047222">It was a supply that was supposed to come from Africa instead of the United States or a supply that was supposed to come from flue dust on ships when and if they ever arrived in port, and this was 1944 that this activity was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.171" offset="6100093">So, I submit to the trier or the fact has a perfect right to find from all the evidence in the case, and there was direct evidence as well as export evidence upon this matter that this 10% was not only an undependable supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.276" offset="6144502">But in addition to that, it was being attacked by the monopolist who eliminated -- who eliminated the millers of oxide about three months after the Court said it should have taken it from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.604" offset="6193821">And that, under these circumstances, a jury could have found that the failure of petitioners was directly caused by the violations which were alleged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.606" offset="6501752">Well, there is another matter, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.246" offset="6508335">The Court of Appeals conceded that there was one element, the elimination of petitioners from the Canadian market which could not be covered by his analysis of causation -- of legal causation but was covered by this Court's decision in Noerr.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.676" offset="6574059">Now, if this Court holds that the Noerr case, as you know is a combination to lobby legislation, doesn't cover a commercial situation such as we have here, then even under the Court of Appeals' notion, there was something that might have gone to a jury and I just wonder why it's necessary to send it back to the Court of Appeals to act on these other things in view of the fact that we had that element that must go to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.429" offset="6669040">So, it's something more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.377" offset="6676877">But those are the two issues we're asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.000" offset="6683355">First of all, that there were the facts to justify cause and secondly, that the Noerr case can't possibly cover a commercial arrangement such as the one that we spoken of here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.023" offset="6719509">Now, when we get down to analysis of these cases, I respectfully submit that this Court made it very clear in Noerr that it was talking only about a combination to lobby legislation and that manifestly, that has nothing to do with the situation where a petitioner or where a defendant is able to get itself appointed as a procuring officer for a Government and, in connection with that procurement, instead of exercising its discretion to buy-in the open market or to buy competitively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.407" offset="6845001">It instead joins that power to purchase with a preexisting conspiracy to monopolize and to restraint the trade of a -- of another competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.846" offset="6882722">All of which has the effect and the purpose of eliminating that competitor from the Canadian market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.976" offset="6907277">I submit that that has no reasonable relationship to the question of whether or not people may combine for the purpose of lobbying through legislation or having legislation pass even though that legislation does have an anticompetitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.555" offset="6961612">And I would like to point on this connection that the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit refused to follow the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.397" offset="6992959">It held that the Noerr case didn't -- didn't authorize a government agent to join a conspiracy in restraint of trade or conspiracy to monopolize trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.887" offset="7038934">It further held that the -- that the Noerr case was simply -- simply held that a combination to instigate legislation, even though it might have anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.731" offset="7082297">It's certainly not a combination to persuade a government agent that he should use his agency powers for the purpose of furthering the interest of a preexisting conspiracy to monopolize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.778" offset="7138513">I submit, if Your Honor please, that those are the issues in the case that the decision of the Court of Appeals below simply overlooks, the decisions of this Court in Story Parchment, Eastman Kodak, and Bigelow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.517" offset="7189400">As a matter of fact, the evidence -- the actual evidence that was adduced in the Story Parchment case by comparison to the evidence that was produced in this case and in this Court, pales almost into insignificance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.340" offset="7244779">All you have in Story Parchment, if you recall, was the fact that after the low prices by the defendants in that action, the worth of the plant which petitioner had in that case decreased in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.955" offset="7295143">The Court of Appeals says that that petitioner would have failed anyway because he didn't have any business knowhow and he was undercapitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.653" offset="7318026">The Supreme Court said that that wasn't the question for the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.305" offset="7328580">It was a question for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.198" offset="7336208">As I say, the Court of Appeals recognized that the Story Parchment case presented some difficulties as in Bigelow and Eastman Kodak, but didn't go on to distinguish those two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.841" offset="7374764">I submit they can't be distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.646" offset="7381974">In addition to that, we submit that the Noerr case can't possibly cover a commercial arrangement such as we have in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1836.694" offset="7450102">I represent the respondent, Vanadium Corporation of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.075" offset="7471626">Mr. Archer who represents the Union Carbide, respondents, will cover the question of the Canadian situation and I will cover the other questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.927" offset="7527111">First of all, I think I should call to the attention of the Court just what kind of a case this is and just why it's here because so much of the brief of petitioner and so much of his questions has taken up with trying to show what a terrible conspiracy this was when as a matter of fact, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in rendering its decision and for the purposes of its decision assumed that a conspiracy had been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.080" offset="7691682">And it's under that assumption that we come -- that the case comes here on the one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.589" offset="7721775">Assuming a conspiracy and assuming that there was evidence or really not discussing the question as to whether there was sufficient evidence of the amount of damage, nevertheless must a plaintiff in an antitrust case prove causation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.355" offset="7804844">Must he prove that the acts of the defendants which are assumed to have been done pursuant to a conspiracy to monopolize and in violation of the Sherman Act, must those acts have caused his injury and must the plaintiff prove that either by direct evirence -- or evidence from which a reasonable inference can be drawn as in the Bigelow case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.275" offset="7912469">Now, Mr. Alioto has spent considerable time arguing the cases which were decided by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.577" offset="7949667">I would assume because there, the judgment and the verdict were for the plaintiffs rather than from the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.067" offset="7979656">But, on this question of causation, those cases are not in point at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.290" offset="8004524">We have an industry here, the vanadium industry, which starts with raw ore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.199" offset="8024168">That ore is converted into oxide by mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.831" offset="8038693">The oxide is in turn converted into ferrovanadium for introduction into the steel bath, and practically all or mostly all of it is sold to the Steel Industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.156" offset="8084041">Now, in the -- in the cases in the -- in the Tenth Circuit, we were involved with the ore miners and we were involved with a mill, the Nisley &amp; Wilson Mill, which made the oxide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.924" offset="8147048">We were involved with two other steps in this process of making vanadium, and proof of causation in those cases furnishes no analogy whatever to proof of causation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.448" offset="8209115">In this case, Mr. Leir, whose name can be used interchangeably with the Continental Ore Corporation because he and his immediate family owned it, came to this country in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.469" offset="8265226">He had had experience in the ferroalloy business in Europe and he determined to go into the ferroalloy business here, not as a fully integrated company and not with the expenditure of a large sum of money to set up the business, but he wanted to come in at the last step in the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.739" offset="8350281">He wanted to buy the oxide from -- mostly produced by these respondents, although varying amounts of it at least 10% and during the certain periods more than that were produced by independent producers -- other producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.585" offset="8425723">He wanted to get in at that stage, buy oxide, take it to someone such as the Apex Smelting Company, whom he did, have that company convert it into ferrovanadium and then in turn, sell the ferrovanadium.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.416" offset="8485073">Now, the -- Judge Magruder, sitting in the Tenth Circuit, after stating the proposition, simply said, “You still have to prove causation,” this is not the Bigelow case, and I shall discuss that later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.922" offset="8563022">“Here, I'm going to assume that this conspiracy existed and that the acts complained of were done but did those acts in anyway damage or injure this plaintiff?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.792" offset="8634493">And, the judge in that case made a very careful factual analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.721" offset="8658213">He took a long time to write his opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.152" offset="8719966">After all that he said, “Well, now, here's the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.671" offset="8734072">This man comes into this business at the level of buying oxide and he says that the plaintiff's had a conspiracy and they damaged him because they shut off his sources of supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.806" offset="8786631">They wouldn't sell to him and they shut off his sources of supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.331" offset="8800737">He couldn't get oxide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.105" offset="8807842">And therefore, he had to go out of the business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.310" offset="8820590">But, the Circuit Court found after a careful examination of the record, that admitting all -- everything, a careful -- examination of the record clearly disclosed that at all times, the plaintiff in this case had plenty of oxide and could have had plenty of oxide and that at the time he went out of business in 1944 or at least he says he did although there's no real proof that he went out of business then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.943" offset="8951097">At that time, there was a lot of oxide and he was offered large quantities of it but he wouldn't take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.068" offset="8975653">So, it's -- it boils down to a simple proposition as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.419" offset="8992998">Now, the first venture that Continental Ore went in was with the Apex Smelting Company, and that was its more serious venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.058" offset="9027584">Apex was a melter of secondary aluminum in Chicago and Continental Ore made a contract with Apex under which Continental Ore was to procure oxide for Apex and Apex was to procure it too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.817" offset="9102608">They were to make ferrovanadium from it, according to Mr. Leir's process which was owned by a French company named Fred A. Coleman, and they were to deliver the ferrovanadium, the finished product to customers that Mr. Leir was to obtain and he was to get a sales commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.896" offset="9174915">All of the money of the venture was to be put up by Apex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.168" offset="9192051">Now, Apex -- that contract was in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.208" offset="9216188">It was a period of about two years before Apex made its first batch of ferrovanadium, caused largely by the fact that the French company that was to instruct it from the process was unable to do so due to the oncoming of the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.293" offset="9276583">But in any event, during that period of two years, Mr. Leir made certain applications, for example, the Vanadium Corporation of America, my client, to purchase oxide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.904" offset="9322977">But at that time, all he wanted to do is take the oxide and sell it abroad at a higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.989" offset="9347323">They refused to sell it to him so that during that period, certainly, his entry into the vanadium business here could not have suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.565" offset="9385671">Now, after Apex started, they made oxide up until the fall of 1941 for a period of about a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.388" offset="9428929">At that time, they had a fire in their ferroalloy plant and were shutdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.546" offset="9453589">And at that time or shortly after that, they decided that they wanted to get out of the business and they wanted to stop this contract with Mr. Leir and they wrote a letter in which they cited many reason for why -- as to why they wanted to get out of it and not one of them was lack of oxide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.564" offset="9537599">There were a number of reasons set forth such as the fire that they had had, that the process had been unsatisfactory, that they couldn't control their dust and their labor was making a fuss that they were dissatisfied with being in business with Continental anyway, and that the melting of secondary aluminum, which was a very important part of the war effort should get their full and undivided attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.868" offset="9658807">And they went out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.950" offset="9667166">Now, there is no -- no evidence on which a reasonable inference can be based that these companies, in any way, contributed to the Apex going out of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.271" offset="9828498">After Apex went out of business, Mr. Leir started the business which comes into this Canadian situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.577" offset="9857651">I won't go into the Canadian part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.285" offset="9868518">But that was the -- he tried to make what he called Van-Ex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.476" offset="9885236">Now, Van-Ex was supposed to be vanadium oxide which could be introduced directly into the steel bath and without going through the step of making ferrovanadium.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.750" offset="9926405">But the undisputed fact showed that in most instances, he simply bought oxide at $1.10 and incidentally, these defendants never fixed the price of oxide during all this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.813" offset="9986591">The price of oxide is fixed by the OPA and the ceiling price was $1.10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.619" offset="10009893">Mr. Leir bought this oxide at $1.10, ground it, repackaged it, added nothing, although in several instances, he added a little fluorspar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.158" offset="10048031">Mostly, he added nothing and resold it at $1.34 or 24 cents above the OPA ceiling price for oxide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.325" offset="10084707">That was the Van-Ex operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.839" offset="10094738">Now, during the entire Van-Ex operation, as the court below found, the plaintiff never applied to the defendants for oxide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.422" offset="10141027">He never asked for any.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.459" offset="10149177">And apparently, he had money because he carried on his operations in Van-Ex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.161" offset="10180002">Then, after he ceased making Van-Ex, he then turned to Climax Molybdenum Corporation and asked them -- made a contract with them to convert 20,000 pounds of oxide into ferrovanadium for him for him to sell, and Climax did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.874" offset="10262862">They carried out that contract and obtained the oxide, half of it from one of these respondents and half of it from another source.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.322" offset="10300688">And then the last venture that he went into and remember, these ventures are specifically alleged in the complaint as being what he did in the vanadium business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.794" offset="10342588">And the -- so, that he -- in the last venture, he tried to interest a company called Imperial Paper &amp; Color Corporation into producing oxide and ferrovanadium and this was in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.313" offset="10424613">Early in 1944, he made this contract and he -- but Imperial had the right not to go ahead with the operation unless they were satisfied that their primary sources of raw material would be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.655" offset="10490023">And about a year later, they decided that they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.166" offset="10520012">There's no evidence that the plaintiffs caused any damage in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.259" offset="10564420">Now, to get around to the basic legal question involved in two of the questions raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.583" offset="10617710">It seems to me that the proposition put forward by Mr. Alioto is, if you have evidence or if you prove a conspiracy under Section 2 or if you prove a violation of Sections 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.365" offset="10696808">And if you established that someone who is in the business got out, you have conclusively proved causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.592" offset="10737768">You have conclusively proved that that person was put out of the business by the acts of those defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.719" offset="10766294">In other words, assuming a monopoly or a conspiracy to monopolize and assuming that a competitor leaves the business, that's conclusive proof of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.346" offset="10808717">And I don't believe that this Court or any court has ever gone that far.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.110" offset="13399855">There was no judgment against them, of course, and they are not respondents here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.297" offset="13576547">That's the first point I want to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.540" offset="13585533">This arises -- let me, first, state what the claim is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.464" offset="13597236">The claim is, in 1942, the plaintiff was selling vanadium oxide to Atlas Steels, a customer in Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.344" offset="13632763">In 1943, the Metals Controller of Canada took over all metals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.991" offset="13655333">There were chemical controllers and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.129" offset="13663901">As part of this, he appointed Electro Metallurgical Company of Canada, which is not a defendant here, his agent to receive allocations of vanadium from the War Production Board in the United States and allocate them in Canada according to the orders of the Metal Controller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.971" offset="13735267">Now, this is in the plaintiff's offer of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.770" offset="13742477">This isn't anything we proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.430" offset="13749060">This is in the offer of proof that plaintiff made below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.648" offset="13761912">Then, the claim is that after he appointed Electro Metallurgical Company of Canada, first, Electro Metallurgical Company of Canada was a Union Carbide subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.957" offset="13803186">It was a Canadian Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.563" offset="13813635">After Electro Metallurgical Company of Canada made its arrangements to get vanadium into Canada, then it refused to buy, after the first shipment from the plaintiff here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.514" offset="13857416">Now, the point I -- the reason why I say this is hypothetical is because there's nothing in the offer of proof that connects these respondents with the Electro Metallurgical Company of Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.760" offset="13918438">There is no evidence that Union Carbide exerted any domination, control, or influence other -- over Electro Metallurgical Company of Canada other than the fact that it was wholly own subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.355" offset="13980818">Now, it is true that the court below assumed -- it assumed -- it actually made it into two assumptions before reaching this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.653" offset="14009971">But it did assume that the defendants had control Union -- Electro Metallurgical Company of Canada but it said it was making that assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.403" offset="14048946">And then it went on to say that assuming that to be the case, there is still no liability because of Noerr Motor Freight.</text>

            <text syncTime="3544.892" offset="14282898">Well, as I understand the cases, this is not necessarily true that if and I pose this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.259" offset="14320410">One of my transfer to -- of objecting to all these was that it was hearsay, although it's been stated that the man who made this conversation was a managing agent, this is not admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.202" offset="14360221">There was no authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.807" offset="14366595">He was not connected with Union Carbide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.753" offset="14374431">There's no evidence that he had any authority to speak for Union Carbide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.344" offset="14388746">The only evidence was that he had an office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.057" offset="14403584">So it would seem to that if the court would say, "Well, we will make the same assumption and send it back down for trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.387" offset="14428871">And it turns out that all the evidence is inadmissible hearsay then it would seem to be a waste of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.062" offset="14459591">Now, let me put it just a little bit differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.097" offset="14471711">If the trial court, when an offer of proof is made, is able to reject it on any other traditional grounds that evidence is rejected in the court, as well as on this point, and he does reject it, it seems to me that that decision is right, and we can affirm it on the ground that the decision was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.323" offset="14572648">We refer to Story Parchment and several cases along this line in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.220" offset="14596263">In that case, this Court held that it should consider upon the merits respondents additional ground for sustaining the judgment below which was that there was no evidence of an antitrust violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.944" offset="14647150">That's a different kind of point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.709" offset="14654255">But although we have not petitioned here, we oppose this point in our response to the petition on the ground that this point was not merely raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.752" offset="14690408">I think it has another aspect to it because when you get to Noerr Motor Freight and that kind of case, and the record in this case is so sparse, it shows no communication, for instance, from Union Carbide to Electro Metallurgical Company of Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.068" offset="14759685">And unless this Court desires, for instance, to reexamine Noerr Motor Freight and Parker against Brown, it would have to have some basis in the record for distinguishing, it seems to me what happened in Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.331" offset="14812662">And in as much as the proof, as we say, the issue that's here is purely hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.164" offset="14836067">The communication here is general from the -- between the respondents and the Electro Metallurgical Company of Canada which was not a respondent or even with the Metals Controller of Canada, which would certainly not be binding, in any sense, upon the defendants in this case who was all inadmissible hearsay, but assuming that all to be admissible, it still does not prove the final point that these respondents communicated with Electro Metallurgical Company of Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.281" offset="14952469">Accordingly, it seems if the Court is going to face a difficult problem like this, it should have a more complete record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.008" offset="14991444">Something that it could reach a decision on and that's -- well, that is fundamentally our point there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.511" offset="15013386">And, as I say, we set out the cases in the brief and say, as a matter of Supreme Court procedure, it is proper to raise a defense like this.</text>
