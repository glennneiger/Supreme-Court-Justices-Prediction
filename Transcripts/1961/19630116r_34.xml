            <text syncTime="11.991" offset="151385">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.322" offset="172701">Just to briefly summarize, this is of course a case for reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.639" offset="197883">It's a case where two admittedly indigent defendants went through a criminal trial which involved 13 felony counts, all of a rather complicated nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.625" offset="261831">One of the felony counts being, an assault with an attempt to commit murder that were reasons to be discussed, counsel was dismissed by the two defendants at the inception of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.556" offset="329644">Both defendants sat mute through the entire trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.942" offset="347094">It raises questions of due process of whether or not there was an effective appointment of counsel and also, what is raised in this case is whether or not as a matter of right on an appeal an indigent defendant should have the absolute right to have counsel appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.010" offset="439463">Now, since our last hearing, there has been a supplemental brief filed by both the petitioners and respondents' answer to that supplemental brief, and my brother Goertzen to my right here has pointed out in his supplemental brief, has made an offer to lodge the murder trial record with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.496" offset="577390">Your Honors may recall there were two murder trials, one was a hung jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.641" offset="601945">Then there was a second murder trial in which the defendant, Douglas was acquitted and Meyes was convicted of second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.912" offset="643009">After that, there was an indictment of both defendants as to robberies, these 13 counts of robberies, and I might point out to the Court in this regard that these 13 robberies that were testified to at this trial -- at this appeal that we're considering here were extensively discussed in the earlier two murder trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.722" offset="762232">By that, I mean, that the same witnesses virtually, the entire cast of witnesses who appeared to testify against the defendants in this matter here testified at both murder trials.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.322" offset="844675">Yes, Your Honor, that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.391" offset="852929">It was a murder charge of the killing of a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.025" offset="871424">Now, I will come to my brother Goertzen's suggestion to lodge that transcript with the Court, because if the Court would be interested to look at that transcript, although we don't wish to overburden the Court of matters outside the record, in a way, it's inextricably tied up into this case, because I believe that that record will indicate to this Court the following information that really hasn't come before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.645" offset="993991">The judge in the first murder case, Judge Roth was the judge who tried these defendants in this matter here, the same judge who refused or -- dismissed counsel after defendants indicated that they didn't want counsel to represent them.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.068" offset="1071626">The same judge that refused to recognize the conflict of interest and denied all of the defendants' motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.719" offset="1102242">We'll also indicate to this Court that the judge who tried the first murder trial, the same judge in this case, disqualified himself to hear the second murder trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.151" offset="1160025">That's an interesting fact because, obviously, he felt that there was some conflict that he should hear this matter a second time, so by the time he came to these robbery trials, he felt that there was no conflict despite a motion being made by the Public Defender Atkins that they should be disqualified under 170.6, which is our statute for --</text>

            <label>Mr. Marvin M. Mitchelson</label>
            <text syncTime="303.384" offset="1316864">He just filed a general disqualification that he had heard -- that he should disqualify himself under -- right.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.280" offset="1344449">Now it would also reveal -- you see there's been much talk of whether or not there could be any possible conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.521" offset="1389484">Now, I say to the Court that I happen to try the -- both murder trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.739" offset="1414353">I represented Douglas and I gained an acquittal for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.574" offset="1441625">And having some personal knowledge of the fact that there were over 266 pages of cross-examination on the second trial and on the first two, of all these witnesses, I can state to this Court not because of the meritorious job that I might have done or did not do, but they were thoroughly impeached these witnesses and very badly discredited.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.588" offset="1541726">And I feel quite frankly in all earnestness that this cross-examination of these witnesses helped gain an acquittal for Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.566" offset="1581641">So when a statement is made by the judge who tried the first case and knows the testimony from these witnesses and the prosecutor who was the same prosecutor on both murder cases that there was no conflict that both defendants were positively identified by all these witnesses in almost every respect, that just is not the truth of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.465" offset="1689266">The truth of the matter is that they were very much discredited, and of course, in this particular trial when those 13 -- when those witnesses are unopposed and there is no one there to cross-examine them in any regard, of course, their testimony at first blush may seem very powerful and very damaging, but I can assure you if counsel had been there to point out the ways that that very same testimony had been impeached prior to that time, there might have been a different result in this case.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>

            <text syncTime="430.820" offset="1826670">No, I did not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.525" offset="1833462">Much to my regret, I was out of the country at the time and that's why I've been here twice because I wish I had represented him, but I might point out, Your Honor, that Meyes received very adequate representation by Public Defender Breckenridge, and I might say this to Your Honors that Mr. Breckenridge is a far more competent attorney than I am and had a vastly more experiences as a trial lawyer and I think that he's represented Douglas and I represented Meyes, the result would have been the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.193" offset="1968149">Now I point that out because I think it's very important in this regard that I would ask my brother Goertzen who he would rather have represented when we talk about no conflict between these two.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.969" offset="2031261">Here is the man on one hand who has four prior felonies, and Douglas who has a clean record has no felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.755" offset="2070444">Douglas who had just received an acquittal for murder, Meyes who's been convicted of a murder and these two were thrown into a trial together and almost naively the prosecutor says their judicial conflict and the court says, “Well tell me, where is your conflict?”</text>
            <text syncTime="509.785" offset="2142542">And Atkins -- defender, Atkins said, “I submit to this Court that it is a conflict that any lawyer should be able to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.506" offset="2177442">Obviously, there's a conflict.”</text>
            <text syncTime="520.767" offset="2186428">Now, how could -- and Atkins says, “I would -- attorney should be in the position to bring out the best phases of Douglas' case as opposed to Meyes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="532.316" offset="2232613">Well, how could he do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="533.828" offset="2238673">It's a question that that could even be brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.897" offset="2246928">It could be done very simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.818" offset="2254660">Let's take Officer Bitterolf who is the crime testifying officer in both matters, all three matters in these robbery cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.042" offset="2299591">In other words Bitterolf testified to show that there was a motive to resist arrest on the part of the defendants that they admitted these robberies after they had been shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.149" offset="2343999">This was around the time of the murder, of course, but they brought this testimony back into the robbery trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.439" offset="2369076">Now you could say that Sergeant Bitterrolf, when he took the stand, “Sergeant Bitterolf, are you biased in this case?”</text>
            <text syncTime="573.985" offset="2399274">I'm talking about the present case, the robbery case and he says, “No, I'm not biased.”</text>
            <text syncTime="579.168" offset="2420067">Well, the fact that a brother officer had been killed in a case where Douglas had been acquitted, it could be a perfectly proper question, I submit to the Court, to show whether or not, there was bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.883" offset="2474924">Your Honors, there isn't any doubt in my mind that this whole proceeding is a result of the bias by the Los Angeles Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.518" offset="2517452">This is a tragic event, the death of a brother officer, but here they have two trials where finally Douglas is acquitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.393" offset="6084942">It's a statement that he's not prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.697" offset="6094137">And Mr. Atkins came into that courtroom that morning and he started out by stating that he was not prepared, he's been trying a case a day like all the other deputies.</text>

            <label>Mr. Burton Marks</label>
            <text syncTime="2102.408" offset="8512972">Now, these judges have an extensive calendar and as a matter of practice in a criminal case, when you go into the time after they'd set for trial, you should either, as private counsel, be prepared or you have discussed it with a District Attorney and you make some disposition of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.262" offset="8592384">In any case, it generally comes down to the fact that there may be two or three trials scheduled, and then -- that are going to definitely go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.726" offset="8626239">And within that, the ambit of that, there is more wheeling and dealing because there are sometimes priors alleged and you might be able to get a prior struck if you waive jury and you might also be able to get a submission on the transcript and you might want a different judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.088" offset="8703770">This is done in the normal course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.051" offset="8711607">There's nothing wrong with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.806" offset="8714637">It's done openly and there is a great deal of working done between counsel and the public defender -- now the -- I mean the prosecuting attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.314" offset="8756642">Now, the interesting thing is that the counsel both the public defender's office and the District Attorney's office are assigned to each particular court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.332" offset="8796662">So the defendant, when he is assigned to a trial court, automatically picks up the public defender and the prosecutor that's assigned to that court unless it's a very, very special case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.971" offset="8839293">Now, there may have been coincidence in our case or there may have been a plan to shoot the case back to Judge Ronword, where Deputy District Attorney Carr was sitting anyway department 104 so he would be familiar with the case at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.893" offset="8902928">Now, this goes directly to Chief Justice Warren's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.881" offset="8922885">Now, getting one step further, and I suppose we have two or three trials in one court, it may be another court that has no trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.379" offset="8956844">They dispose of their entire calendar perhaps they had a probation sentence calendar that morning and they finish it early.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.372" offset="8980877">Now, we have a gentleman by the name of Earl Osatche who was a very amiable person and he sits up there, he is a coordinator and he has every case down in every court, and again, there is a sort of wheeling and dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.003" offset="9039391">You go and see Mr. Osatche and you ask him what courts are open and you -- if you are experienced in the criminal field there, you know which judges favor certain cases, don't favor certain cases, and you try and get your client the best possible deal by getting him into a certain judge, if that Court is open and if you can get in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.234" offset="9116296">Some courts will open say for just half an hour or an hour and if you can state that your trial will only take that long, you will get transferred into that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.652" offset="9157987">So therefore, I want -- this comes down to the conclusion or the question, was there any prejudice to the prosecution or the people or to the courts by denying a continuance, the request for a short continuance by the defendant's counsel who was then counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.156" offset="9240012">I think the answer must be ‘no', because of the volume of business that extended, none of the courts would have been prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.126" offset="9271881">There are always two or three cases waiting to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.801" offset="9282539">They're always continuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.091" offset="9291734">Many times they have to open up a civil court in order to take care of the business for a criminal trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2395.167" offset="9683989">Well, I might say that I don't believe that public defenders nor private counsel for the most part and this represent to the court for any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.155" offset="9727979">Now, there are many reasons why you -- you aren't prepared, it's mere dilatoriness on your part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.408" offset="9748982">That's -- I think the Court can reject your claim of not being ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.122" offset="9771865">They also -- there's many factors a court has to take into consideration in granting continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.948" offset="9791195">One is convenience of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.712" offset="9798196">Well, in this case, there obviously were several private witnesses but it might note that in the first place, they were -- had already been called to court twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.270" offset="9836440">And this was at -- on this case, the third time, for reasons -- let's put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.068" offset="9867682">For reasons known only to the District Attorney's office, they preferred to charge these two defendants with murder and not the robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.397" offset="9908955">They never -- in the first cases, they never had the substantive counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.739" offset="9922330">So the District Attorney's office charged these people with murder, uses the facts of the robbery to prove the lying in wait or a consciousness of guilt on behalf of the defendants and after there has been an acquittal of one of the defendants files the 13-robbery counts as substantive counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.613" offset="9981785">Now the -- I don't think that the District Attorney can stand up and properly say, “We're prepared and our witnesses are here so you can't give these defendants a chance”.</text>

            <text syncTime="3617.203" offset="14572231">The first thing that happened, Atkins was -- or the public defenders office was appointed for purposes of these crimes, these 13 counts on -- formally on August 18th, 1959.</text>

            <text syncTime="3695.263" offset="14884446">This -- this point also goes to the matter of continuance for preparation and other grounds which I'll discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.230" offset="14908270">Now, one thing that my brother Marks left out is procedurally, and this is done all the time and it's -- it's before this Court by way of citation of the Kerfoot case in California in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.341" offset="14960724">The public defender, when he comes up with a conflict or an idea of lack of preparation or needs more time, he can go to the Court and get an advancing date, and the Court will put aside a few minutes and he'll come in as he did in Kerfoot, the case was set for trial in Kerfoot on September 14th and on September 1st, at the request of the public defender, the cause was advanced, then he came in and he said, Your Honor, I've had a problem with my clients here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.911" offset="15075035">I've talked to him just once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.355" offset="15080782">I think there's a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.941" offset="15087156">I'm not prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.875" offset="15090918">We don't even have the transcript yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.573" offset="15097710">We're going to need more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.046" offset="15103561">And the Court made a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.700" offset="15114219">So it's not uncommon for -- and in harmony, with due administration of justice to advance these causes and make known in advance the particular reasons you might want a conflict or a continuance for more preparation time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.128" offset="15179839">So that was not done here and, of course, I would like to turn briefly to the Atkins preparation apart from the conflict and in keeping with -- or in sort of a response to Mr. Justice White's last questions of my brother Marks, at page 80, when Meyes, who was the first one to -- this is so-called palaver about dismissal of counsel, this judge was not going to dismiss the counsel unless these men made an unqualified dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.669" offset="15326020">That is they full well knew that when they dismiss them, they were on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.768" offset="15342425">Now, the conflict figures into this, but I'll cover that later, but he wanted an unqualified dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.361" offset="15364786">He won't let counsel go unless these men fully understand that they're going to have to board out the jury, argue to the jury, cross-examine witnesses, they're going to be on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.562" offset="15401671">And at page 80, Meyes said, “I don't want you under any circumstances” to Atkins and that was the ultimate qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.818" offset="15442631">Then the judge turned, Judge Ron turned to Douglas and says, “What's your feeling?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.635" offset="15457886">And he says the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.279" offset="15464469">It's right at page 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.793" offset="15478575">Now, the basic California Penal Code Section on continuances and it's certainly a reasonable one and in harmony with Mr. Justice Black's expression of this type of procedure in Avery versus Alabama is Penal Code Section 1050.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.318" offset="15548688">The welfare of the people of State of California requires that all proceedings and criminal cases shall be set for trial and heard and determined at the earliest possible time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.340" offset="15580766">No continuance of a criminal trial should be granted except on affirmative proof in open court upon reasonable notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.183" offset="15612113">Therefore, in our case, since these motions were all made on the opening day of trial, that's certainly not reasonable notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.695" offset="15638131">Therefore, we're going to have to have an awfully strong showing to get around an abuse of -- to get around in exercise of the discretion that Judge Ron did utilize in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.438" offset="15685151">So let's -- let's look at the facts of our case before this Court now forgetting the murder cases for the present moment, except insofar as they may apply -- implied by this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.369" offset="15736874">Why did Atkins want a continuance?</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.718" offset="15746278">Page 29 says, “There are 13 counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.412" offset="15757040">The defense is not ready because we have not been able to complete the investigation as to certain offenses which we're trying to develop as to these many dates”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.499" offset="15789328">However the facts show that the -- and this was the only purpose counsel before you offers to lodge the murder trial transcripts because in that, there are 11 of the 13 counts in our case before us were gone into thoroughly, the same witnesses, the same testimony was offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.259" offset="15888384">It comprises approximately 287 pages of the 3819 page murder transcript of cross-examination and examination of these witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.175" offset="15932061">These trials were had in May and February of the prior year or of the same year; May 1959 and February 1959, and remember -- recalling our trials in September 1959 on these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.966" offset="15983261">And the deputy public defender Breckenridge had handled this case and as Mr. Mitchelson says, he did a very competent adequate job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.699" offset="16018160">After all his men were charged with killing a police officer, second degree in acquittal is, I think, an excellent tribute to their endeavors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.929" offset="16055045">Now, Mr. Breckenridge is in the same office as Atkins and also ancillary to this, I'd like to point out that on August 3rd and 4th, a preliminary hearing was handled in this matter and deputy public defender's sought there, represented both to these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.895" offset="16138951">Nothing was raised of the conflict at that time, almost 60 days prior to the date of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.659" offset="16162043">Nothing was raised about any conflict on August 18th when the deputy public defender was formerly appointed for purposes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.499" offset="16193390">Nothing was raised on August 21st when they were back in Court for arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.796" offset="16210526">No advance whatsoever in dates for raising any lack of preparation or conflict or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.841" offset="16238738">This is done -- all done September 30th, the opening morning of trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="4079.016" offset="16419401">I would assume they had been incarcerated from the time of their arrest in November of or latter part of 1958 when they're arrested for the police killing, which -- the sequence of events where the robberies all antedated the killing of the officer and these -- these robberies were offered for -- in a very important aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.482" offset="16509262">Now recall -- in one of Atkins grounds that he want to continue, is he hadn't have time to investigate the alibis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.305" offset="16532564">Well, these crimes occurred in the middle of 1958, and they were offered to show motive as to why Douglas and Meyes would lie and wait in his back bedroom for this officer having heard him at the front door and knew he -- knowing he was coming back, lying in wait, and when the officer walked in shoot him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.790" offset="16606542">Now since that was such an important part of the -- of the prosecution's theory, we would submit that there -- the very ample reason why public defender Breckenridge and Mr. Mitchelson do all they could to produce whatever alibis for those dates they could to negate that element and in fact, Mr. Mitchelson did offer on behalf of Douglas a -- an alibi for the July 25th charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.604" offset="16713749">I believe he can correct me if I'm wrong and his sister testified that he was home painting her bedroom or something on that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.554" offset="16741543">And otherwise, as to all other dates, both categorically denied the Commission, but there is reason they would want to develop these alibis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.531" offset="16773517">And so, to that extent, Mr. Breckenridge, and I'm sure that he would share anything he had with Mr. Solar who would share it with Mr. Atkins.</text>

            <text syncTime="4616.252" offset="18568338">In 19 -- fiscal year 1960, 1961, Los Angeles County paid to a private appointed counsel where there was a conflict of interest, disqualification of the public defender's office, $102,352.41.</text>

            <text syncTime="4717.370" offset="18972818">In other words, this is the expense of almost a quarter of a million dollars for private attorneys where there's a conflict, it's reasonable for Judge Ron to look down and say, “Let's have a showing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5445.624" offset="21885889">Now, I queried in my brief, my respondents -- my reply brief to the -- or supplemental reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.737" offset="21942314">The man raises a murder case that at the most has a very small part in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.734" offset="21978258">It goes only to the arrest, the where and when and how the man was -- these two men were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.197" offset="22004172">The actual crimes charged the robberies, the assaults, these witnesses, we submit, testified side by side, Douglas and Meyes coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5486.061" offset="22047640">In some case, Douglas was kind of the leader and in some case, Meyes was kind of the leader, but one or the other, the witnesses place them side by side in all of these establishments in the perpetuation of all of these counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5499.676" offset="22102079">The only -- Mr. Carr, the prosecutor, did in fact point out to the judge in his own showing and I -- and it's somewhere between 32 and 36, he does make a statement and read the continuance, well, I don't understand what the conflict will be, and he's referring to the defenses, they both categorically denied the commission of these earlier crimes, that was his own comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.086" offset="22195702">He was restricting himself to any possible defense conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.849" offset="22210748">That is one man attempting to blame the other for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.202" offset="22224227">And I would like in a few brief seconds remaining to me because Mr. James wants to get at the appellant, I'd like to point out something that was not touched on in oral argument before and I think it reflects a showing somewhat of Atkins' preparation in the fact that Atkins himself had prepared a defense within the narrow limitations of what these men really had available as a defense and that is attempting to hit at the prosecution's case, and I refer to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.034" offset="22395486">In the preliminary -- in the preliminary hearing, neither defendant, of course, takes the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.552" offset="22425579">That's just a hearing on the evidence very generally and all these witnesses were called and the municipal court judge, the committing magistrate binds them over if there's adequate evidence if not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.834" offset="22478660">However, it submitted that in this record of this preliminary of some 287 or 267 pages, Mr. Solar occupies -- he is the deputy public defender that handled it for both of them, 141 pages cross-examining these witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.407" offset="22541040">And in that time, he took him over the -- virtually the identical calls of Mr. Mitchelson and Mr. Breckenridge in the earlier murder cases had -- as to perceptive ability to identify these witnesses, attempting to show that because of their fear, because of eyesight or lighting conditions, they couldn't really identify these men or they might have made some mistakes in identification of these men as perpetrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.362" offset="22644799">Now, at the murder case, at least the second murder case, Mr. Mitchelson -- Mr. Mitchelson's cross-examination and Mr. Breckenridge's, the deputy public defender's cross-examination went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.818" offset="22698611">Of course, they're in trial and that's another reason this record was offered to be lodged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.365" offset="22728808">That cross-examination shows and recalling that no alibi witnesses say one where it offered the murder case as to these robberies, but that cross-examination shows, attempts to commit a possible police pressure on these witnesses to identify these men sort of a police revenge theory type of thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.967" offset="22823267">Again, he goes over to the perceptibility of the victims under the theory and lighting conditions to identify them and there's in fact an impeachment of the character of these witnesses being in bookmaking establishments possibly and being gamblers and that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.572" offset="22885648">Of course, Judge Ron said that even gamblers and bookmakers are entitled not to be robbed and I think he's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.037" offset="22911561">But that was the attack used as to this robbery evidence and the prior murder case and then the preliminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.207" offset="22936221">Now, let's go to the instant record and look at Atkins' tact that he used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.563" offset="22957641">Remember, he did get to actually start dowering the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.208" offset="22972165">He wasn't dismissed until page 80 and I think his voir dire is approximately 58 to page 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.795" offset="23002572">He says to the jury, can you visualize yourself and I will address you all, can you visualize a situation, this is at page 64, involving a policeman at the police force, those involved in that homicide, he brings up the homicide, those police officers involved in that homicide can get themselves so worked up that they would choose to take the vengeance they think should be done to the perpetrators of the homicide under their own hands toward building other cases against those that they feel responsible for the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.070" offset="23107688">There's a police revenge theory which the judge -- Judge Ron later says -- sustained an objection of the question on the grounds that this was brought down and he couldn't be advancing his theories of defense at this stage, but he was attempting to educate the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5764.932" offset="23163068">He says later on at page -- pages 69 says, “Do you believe that eyewitnesses to events can be wrong?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5771.192" offset="23188146">And later, he reversed the question, “Do you believe that it is possible that an eyewitness to an event can make a mistake as to the defendant?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5778.031" offset="23215522">In other words, whether it is possible that a person seeing something can then relate it and believe he is telling the truth and be mistaken, that's at page 69.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.969" offset="23247287">The weaknesses in the prosecution's eyewitness identification case, that's the second theory of defense for these men and he is obviously going to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.104" offset="23283754">I submit the record also shows that Mr. Atkins had definitely decided to put Mr. Meyes on the stand as well as Douglas because he does asked -- he asked the jury at page 65, if it came to your knowledge that one of these defendants had been convicted of a very serious felony in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="5814.909" offset="23362957">First, I will ask that part.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.117" offset="23367868">First, would you be able to keep that felony conviction separate and apart from the other defendant in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.340" offset="23388766">Again, I'm going to go down the line out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.186" offset="23396080">By that question, I mean, I am just asking you if you think you would be capable of not letting that conviction taint the other person in any way, in other words, the birds of a feather attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="5832.517" offset="23433488">And then he goes on at page 65 to also ask the question, would you let Meyes' felony convictions so prejudice you that you wouldn't be able to appraise the prosecution evidence against him, himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="5855.872" offset="23526902">Now, I submit those thoughts merely to show that there was an awfully narrow limitation within which any counsel, two counsels and four counsels, or one counsel could work with this case, and Mr. Atkins was in fact attempting to pursue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5873.453" offset="23597223">The fact that he was attempting to pursue that showed that he certainly knew those prior records.</text>
            <text syncTime="5878.367" offset="23616867">He certainly knew the limitations under which he was offered to these men and for any of the reasons I've stated here and for the analysis provided in the brief -- briefs which I have not touched on here orally, I think there was no real conflict and that Judge Ron made a proper exercise on the day of trial and denied a continuance and appointment of separate counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="7220.562" offset="28985657">As to the actual murder itself, we make no contention that there wasn't an ample or sufficient conflict in the receipt of evidence and that Meyes may have been and ultimately, was found by the jury to be more culpable or culpable for the crime and Douglas wasn't, and they attended advantages -- disadvantages of separate counsel in arguing this particular case but there was in fact no attempt by Meyes or Douglas to cast blame for the crime of the other to put himself up or hoist himself up by his own bootstraps.</text>

            <text syncTime="7490.114" offset="30063783">Perhaps, I could perhaps speak myself for moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7493.756" offset="30078412">Douglas, they never denied those statements were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="7497.662" offset="30093981">In the beginning, the police were trying to play one against the other so they brought them together and these all came out in every bit of this in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="7504.929" offset="30123133">That's precisely the point I think you're asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="7507.224" offset="30132224">It is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="7508.434" offset="30137135">They brought them together and then they started fighting amongst themselves, because one had told Meyes that Douglas had died so when Meyes saw Douglas, he said, well, what are you trying to do to me?</text>
            <text syncTime="7518.981" offset="30179244">So they started accusing each other and every bit of that is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="7523.376" offset="30196903">And therefore, in answer to your question, there certainly was a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="7530.438" offset="30225115">You see, Douglas' theory of defense was simply that he was shot and he was in a corner and he doesn't know what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="7536.939" offset="30251133">Now, Meyes finally admitted that he did do the shooting and he used the self-defense theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="7542.321" offset="30272658">You cannot say if they're not in conflict with one another just because they have entirely different theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="7547.096" offset="30291780">Douglas in no way supports Meyes' theory because Douglas says I was shot and I was practically dead and I'm in the corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="7553.558" offset="30317589">I don't know what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="7555.171" offset="30324067">If you mean that he actually knocked into the trial, he did not do that, but there was that conflict --</text>

            <text syncTime="7585.743" offset="30446320">What you have been talking about relates to the murder trial, and as I understand it, the conflict that is claimed to have existed in this case, relates to two things: (1) the fact that Douglas was acquitted on the murder trial, and (2), the fact that Meyes in contradistinction to Douglas had a long criminal record.</text>

            <text syncTime="7617.335" offset="30572753">My brothers keep saying in the opposite side that they both -- there's no conflict as to all these robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="7623.929" offset="30599084">There's a categorical denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7626.003" offset="30607339">Well, indeed, that is where the most conflict is because I catalog -- my final argument just to answer your question, the last -- the 111 pages, I devoted 38 pages of my argument to showing how these robberies never could have taken place as to Douglas, because there was such a lack of positive identification of Douglas and there was almost in all instances a positive identification of Meyes and I went through great lengths to contrast.</text>
            <text syncTime="7658.531" offset="30737533">Now, what could have an attorney do in this case at bar?</text>
            <text syncTime="7661.628" offset="30749863">He could stay up and stand up after he has cross-examined all these witnesses at the end of the trial, and say, “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, they've identified Meyes but they were -- they never identified Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="7673.603" offset="30797824">Look how they were impeached as to Douglas, look how it impeached them in the past two trials.”</text>
