            <text syncTime="341.393" offset="1468897">He himself had been in custody for some robbery or the crime and by the time of his testimony in this case, he was in -- on probation from a conviction of the crime of robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.615" offset="1625840">In interrogating Campbell, they came to the conclusion that the petitioner here, Charles Townsend, had something to do with regard to these murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.655" offset="1670040">And with Campbell to identify the petitioner, they went to 35th Indiana at about 1:45 am on New Years day, January 1, 1954 and arrested the petitioner in the company of another man whom later they dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.148" offset="1727927">The record is silent as to what they did with this other man.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.229" offset="1804309">Townsend was taken to the second district police station and there he was held from approximate 2:45 am until 5 am, and there is nothing important that occurred between 1:45 am and 8:30 pm that will be or will be crucial federal question presented here except for one fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.364" offset="1892812">Approximate an hour and a half, prior to the time that Townsend was arrested, he had taken a large injection of heroine and it is without dispute that for the period, from the time that he was 15 years of age until the time relevant here, he had been a confirmed narcotic addict and this fact had been so found by the Supreme Court of Illinois</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.326" offset="4488652">It is beyond my sense of comprehension to believe that an experienced police officer like Cagney and Corcoran who were part of the homicide section of Chicago Police Department would call a doctor to the police station to inspect and examine and give therapy to a principal witness or the principal suspect to clear up six important felonies and not have in mind some relationship between the administration of the drug and the consequence that was reached.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.695" offset="5686105">There, he said that he gave him 1/8 of gram of Phenobarbital and 1/230 of a gram of hyoscine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.684" offset="5738141">Now, if You Honors please, that is 16 times more drug than this doctor had testified before the judge because a gram contains 15.432 grains and roughly in drug palettes, a gram has approximately 16 times more drug than a grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.167" offset="5824031">Now, before the judge and I again call Your Honors' attention that only once, only once in this doctor's testimony that he defined and that appears on 215 on the record, only once did he say that he administered 1/230 of a grain of hyoscine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.620" offset="5905847">Now to answer Your Honor's question, it is generally agreed by all pharmacological experts, both in this country and in Europe, that the therapeutic dose of hyoscine within the normal range that will not completely paralyze an individual is between 1/200 of a grain and 1/100 of a grain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.403" offset="6713031">But the evidence in the record, when looked at against the accepted pharmacological expert opinion, by which this evidence must be judged, is that this man was given according to this doctor's own testimony for the jury, 16 times more drugs than is recognized as a therapeutic dose.</text>
