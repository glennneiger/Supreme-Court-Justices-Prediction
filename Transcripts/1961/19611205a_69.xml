            <text syncTime="18.177" offset="176044">Petitioner in this case is also seeking collateral relief from conviction in sentence, in this case for two bank robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.879" offset="214915">The convictions rest upon pleas of guilty entered on February 24th, 1956 in the record at page 40, sentence was imposed on May 23rd, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.825" offset="270712">The sentence is aggregating on four accounts for the two bank robberies 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.600" offset="289729">This is on the record at page 42 and 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.256" offset="308433">This present proceeding was instituted on February 9th, 1959 as a motion to vacate sentences under Section 2255 of judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.209" offset="352214">The District Court for the Northern District of Ohio summarily denied the motion and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed in a brief per curiam opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.148" offset="399966">One of the issues in this case may I say at the outset is identical to the issue in Hill versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.475" offset="425253">It's argued namely a violation of Federal Criminal Rule 32 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="86.224" offset="448240">I don't think there's any necessity for me to say more on that rule beyond this. What is at stake in this rule is nothing less than the right of a defendant to be heard and there's nothing more fundamental to our concept with due process and the right for a defendant to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.554" offset="537579">In the context of the sentencing hearing, Rule 32 (a) imposes on the judge the obligation to make that right effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.862" offset="638830">The Rule 32 (a) to the extent that it operates determined by this Court in the Green case operates to provide the defendant himself personally, not to this counsel, personally the right to speak and this Court virtually unanimous to Mr. Justice Stewart only accepting took that position in the Green case.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.935" offset="799117">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.738" offset="810297">And what I say with respect to Rule 32 (a) is the same as I would say under Rule 11th or Rule 44.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.180" offset="832136">These do not restate constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.230" offset="844257">There is no constitutional right that I know of that could be stated in terms of an obligation on the Court to initiate some proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.018" offset="883440">What the rules do is they extend and make more effective that underlying constitutional rights by imposing on the judge, not the defendant and not his lawyer the obligation to undertake to vindicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.339" offset="944776">The second issue in this case is far more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.235" offset="968286">May I say Mr. Justice Whittaker before it pass it, that the Government, Mrs. Cooper has indicated concedes that 32 (a) has violated in this case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.883" offset="1006947">A more fundamental question raised by petitioner, Machibroda however concerns the validity of its underlying conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.021" offset="1035473">As I've indicatively these were obtained based upon guilty pleas and by his motion under Section 2255, petitioner contends that his pleas were wrongfully induced by promises made by the prosecutor, the Assistant United States Attorney and that this was further compounded by a failure of the judge to comply with a mandatory requirements of Rule 11 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.040" offset="1147486">I stress at the outset that there was no hearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.920" offset="1171101">The United States filed a response, until the response was attached an affidavit of the Assistant United States Attorney who was charged with having -- made the bargain with the prisoner but there has been as yet no hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.136" offset="1235884">And the only real issue in this case is whether the prisoner is entitled to a hearing on these very serious allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.989" offset="1271306">Since there was no hearing, I believe the Government concedes that the allegations must be assumed to be true for purposes of this proceeding unless, in the words of a statute which is on the top of page 4 of petitioner's brief, unless the motion and the files and records of the case, conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the Court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States Attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact in conclusions of law with respect thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.610" offset="1441834">The court below has determined in the language of the statute that the files and records of this case conclusively show that the petitioner is entitled to no relief and this position the Government supports in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.464" offset="1505259">The motion is found in the record beginning on page 13, and there is of course the most crucial document in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.358" offset="1536815">The most pertinent allegations concerning the bargain are on pages 14 and 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.359" offset="1568789">In sum, without reading this now, the petitioner alleges that there were three relevant conversations between the Assistant United States Attorney and himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.504" offset="1613406">The first occurred in the county jail where he was being detained on or about February 21st, 1956 which was three days before his arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.516" offset="1657396">The prosecutor promised petitioner that if he entered pleas of guilty, he would receive a total sentence of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.510" offset="1689370">The promise was set to be made with the authority of the United States Attorney and was implied to be agreeable to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.052" offset="1711626">It was a bargain that was virtually ironclad.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.389" offset="1732942">Further, petitioner was expressly cautioned not to tell his lawyer of the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.119" offset="1755826">The lawyer was taken out of the arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.938" offset="1771081">The second conversations took place in the county jail on May 22nd, 1956 which was the day before sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.009" offset="1799398">At that time, the prosecutor reported the petitioner that the judge was “vexed”, because petitioner had testified in behalf of a codefendant who had stood trial in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.995" offset="1851329">The prosecutor indicated there might be some trouble with respect to the agreement that the sentence was not to exceed a total of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.527" offset="1881527">When petitioner protested that he was going to bring the whole thing to the attention of the judge in open court, the prosecutor replied there's nothing to worry about.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.760" offset="1914441">If the court imposes more than a 20 year sentence, the United States Attorney would move to have a sentence reduced within 60 days, an authorized procedure and the petitioner was further told threateningly that if he “insisted on making a scene” his difficulty would be compounded with further charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.303" offset="1992600">Third conversation took place immediately after sentence had been announced on May 23rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.369" offset="2016841">Again, the prosecutor promised that as soon as the judge “cooled off”, the United States Attorney would have a sentence reduced to 20 years and the prisoner was taken off to begin to serve his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.991" offset="2075355">The motion further alleges that subsequent to his incarceration, he sent two letters to the Judge and two letters to the Attorney General protesting against the failure of the Government and the Court to keep the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.146" offset="2139930">He received no reply to either of these letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.818" offset="2154663">Now this is in general the substance of the allegations of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.091" offset="2175770">What has happened in effect is that the Government and the court below has tried this motion virtually received evidence, in fact, received evidence without having allowed the prisoner even the basic rights of a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.748" offset="2250376">The Government concedes, I believe it's a concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.239" offset="2260302">It's hard to read but there is nothing in the files and records of this case which is inconsistent with the motion on behalf of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.574" offset="2317667">And this is -- it is in itself deemed I suppose his basic rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.080" offset="2339715">He is pictured as a prisoner who had deliberately concocted a story, tailor-made so-called to fit the facts of this case and explain any apparent inconsistencies by some facts not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.228" offset="2404289">This voice of the prisoner makes him I suppose, a psychopathic liar who cannot be believed, no matter what he says even though I take that the Government concedes there's not a single fact in the record which tends to contradict the story of the bargain as he alleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.189" offset="2488090">What does appear in the first instance is the affidavit as I mentioned of the Assistant United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.845" offset="2518706">This was filed as an appendix or in appended to, the response of United States and is relied upon heavily by the Government in their brief and -- in their brief and this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.767" offset="2562487">I cannot find one single justifiable reason for that affidavit to be in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.595" offset="2589759">It is nothing more or less an attempt to try the case without having a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.931" offset="2615045">If as the Government must do, they conceived the facts as alleged by the motion for purposes of summary disposition, the affidavit is at no point, the Government says the affidavit is here simply to show that the Government does not agree with the fact alleged in the motion which would be perfectly obvious without the affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.724" offset="2754226">From the standpoint of the court using it, referring to it in the opinion and arguing to this Court I don't see the relevance.</text>

            <label>Mr. Curtis R. Reitz</label>
            <text syncTime="674.582" offset="2801664">Well, the Government says and they're technically quite accurate that the court below did not specifically rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.963" offset="2835205">However, in this opinion of the Court which appears on the record on the beginning on page 47th, the Court does have a sentence which is unusual for a simple passing reference on page 49, the three quarters of the way down under oath, Clarence M. Condon, former Assistant United States Attorney empathically denied these allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.230" offset="2928306">That's a stronger statement that I would expect from a simple recitation of fact but there is nothing in here to indicate that the Court expressly relied upon that affidavit, that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.161" offset="2971982">Now the second piece of evidence that is in here, it's nothing more or less than testimony of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.973" offset="3003225">The Judge says on the bottom of page 49, in reference to the letters which the prisoner said he sent from prison protesting the breach of faith on the part of the prosecutor in court, the Judge says this Court did not receive two letters from the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.662" offset="3078040">That is nothing more or less in the statement by a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.206" offset="3096221">As Justice Frankfurter said in the Gibson case, human memory is a very treacherous thing and that's particularly true when you don't recall something having happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.167" offset="3140002">The judge has dismissed these allegations as to protests filed contemporaneous with the man's entering into prison by saying, “I don't remember receiving them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="770.249" offset="3184410">Now, even if it's true that the judge did not receive the letters even that would not prove that the letters had not been sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.065" offset="3215653">The prisoner alleges that they were posted.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.020" offset="3227460">He cannot of course allege that they were received.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.662" offset="3241984">Whether they ever got to the courthouse, whether they were handled by members of the clerk staff and the court no one really knows at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.036" offset="3275525">There's been no hearing on the allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.697" offset="3290154">Now the second bit of evidence which the court does formerly use is a letter allegedly received by the court some six months after the prisoner got to prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.533" offset="3341458">In this letter, the prisoner in a very neat tone asked for clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.733" offset="3370297">Now the Court on page 40 -- on page 50, describes this as evidence which indeed it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.499" offset="3401331">There has been no showing that this letter is authentic.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.977" offset="3415228">There has been no introduction of this letter into the files and workers of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.402" offset="3432991">It's simply a letter, a private letter sent by a prisoner to a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.031" offset="3455457">The letter was bad enough but the inference from which the judge draws from this letter is even worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.389" offset="3476877">The judge says that the inference from this letter shows the defendant's allegations must be false because he's asking for clemency rather than protesting the breach of faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.596" offset="4589798">He's likely to say yes, if he's going through with the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.180" offset="4612054">What the court should have done and did not do and this is the violation of Rule 11 which petitioner has alleged is he should have made more than this simple perfunctory inquiry to determine what it was that motivated the defendant to plead guilty, to have explored the nature of the crime with him, to have explored why it was that he was entering that plea, a simple routine perfunctory question like this cannot conceivably satisfy Rule 11, and this Court I think has squarely so held in the Shelton case, where in fact the Government confessed error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.102" offset="4767744">In the Shelton case more than a simple question like this and the judge to the prisoner, they had a formal proceeding with the prisoner signing the guilty plea in open court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.646" offset="4818004">You couldn't find a more willing expression of a guilty plea than there was in the Shelton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.994" offset="4843395">And yet the Government when the case reached this Court, confessed error, said there had been a violation of Rule 11 and there was also in the background of that case an alleged bargain but it was a combination of the bargain plus the violation of Rule 11 which was relied upon by the Solicitor General in asking this Court to reverse and this Court summarily did reverse that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.139" offset="4943914">And the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the Shelton case established a rule which seems highly oscillatory in these circumstances in connection with Rule 11 that where there has been a violation of the rule and there were allegations of a bargain or some defect in the plea, the burden of proof shifts to the Government to show that the plea was in fact voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.846" offset="5038791">I don't think it's necessary to the argument of this case to adopt that rule but it indicates what follows or what could conceivably follow from the failure of the Court to make the mandatory inquiry required by Rule 11.</text>

            <text syncTime="2063.661" offset="8358013">Now, as Mr. Reitz has pointed out, the court heard the assurance of the petitioner that it was his desire to waive indictment into the pleas of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.916" offset="8410990">In this instance, it was asked if that's your desire Mr. Machibroda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.826" offset="8426663">Is that your desire?</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.588" offset="8437739">Now, the record also shows that the petitioner was 26 years old at the time of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.172" offset="8468041">And Judge Kloeb personal assessment of the petitioner at the time of sentencing is important we think or is at least significant insofar as it has a bearing on petitioner's later conduct and credibility at the time of imposing the 40 year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.272" offset="8544423">Judge Kloeb said that in view of the seriousness and the extent of the crimes which involved some a $159,000 and aggravated circumstances of bank robbery including the use of the gun that it was his feeling, that is the feeling of the court that petitioner needed to -- that rather society needed protection from petitioner until, he reached a age of 50 or 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.601" offset="8669811">Now the record shows that petitioner also wrote to Judge Kloeb, six months after sentencing and we think this letter is properly a part of the files certainly in the records of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.507" offset="8725400">This letter is important and that Judge Kloeb in describing it as the only letter he had ever received from petitioner relied upon it as a great extent, to a great extent as we think he had a right to do in deciding that petitioner's allegations of a bargain -- that these allegations were not credible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.199" offset="8796139">This letter appears at pages 55 to 56 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2191.954" offset="8871163">It is apparent we think that this is not the letter of an angry young man who had been misled but rather the letter of a contrite man who is sorry for his transgressions against society and for Judge Kloeb's assessment of him which led to the imposition of the 40 year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.635" offset="8961964">You will notice that at -- on page 55 he says, “I am advised by the decisions arrived at.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2247.320" offset="9092681">Notice that he expresses at that time respect for the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.433" offset="9109086">I believe that our law today represents not only but authority but justice, in the true sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.901" offset="9142941">And notice he also expressed his respect for Judge Kloeb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.010" offset="9159450">You being a federal judge and a man of intelligence, integrity and humility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.708" offset="9186200">Note -- finally, the relief that he request, I urge you to reconsider my case in the hope that you would consider making my two sentences concurrent which would've resulted in a 25 year sentence, had the sentences been concurrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.305" offset="9260596">Now this then is the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.727" offset="9278255">On the other hand, we might consider the allegations which petitioner made in his motion to vacate which was -- that the motion was filed three years, almost three years thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.117" offset="9327888">In his affidavit which appears at pages 20 and 23 of the record and to which the court's attention had previously been called.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.596" offset="9365713">He alleged not only that he entered the plea in 1956 because Mr. Condon promised him that if he would do so, he would receive a sentence not exceeding 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.797" offset="9418585">But he also implied that the court had knowledge of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.142" offset="9443976">Now this is of course is the same court that petitioner had praised six months after the inquisition of the 60-year sentence as a man of integrity, intelligence and humility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.468" offset="9497266">Now, petitioner also alleged in his motion that he had written two letters to the court informing of their agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.695" offset="9530180">Yet the only letter which Judge Kloeb had received is that letter which we have already seen which was a letter of an entirely different character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.961" offset="9567169">And petitioner further alleged that Mr. Condon promised him that in the event the sentence exceeded the promised 20 years, that he would move -- Mr. Condon would move within 60 days thereafter for reduction of that part of the sentence which exceeded the 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.327" offset="9640730">And yet petitioner waited after this time almost three years before instituting the present proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.091" offset="9679705">Under these circumstances it is understandable that Judge Kloeb found petitioner's allegations to be false.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.477" offset="9709275">And significantly Judge Kloeb stated in his comprehensive memorandum which appears at pages 47 to 52 of the record that if he had any doubt at all about the truth or the falsity of the allegations, he would've required a hearing but that he could draw no other conclusion, no other conclusion from the record but that petitioner's allegations were mere concocted -- or afterthoughts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.462" offset="9849187">Petitioner's position would appear to be that no matter how ludicrous or how patently false our allegations are in the light of the record, is a movement under Section 2255 does in fact set out details of an alleged agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.384" offset="9916897">An alleged injustice within his personal knowledge, he is entitled to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.613" offset="9949811">We do not believe this to be the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.899" offset="9966947">The often repeated generalization that averments of fact under Section 2255 motion must be accepted as true means only that they must be accepted as true insofar as they are not conclusively shown to be false by the files and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.703" offset="10046151">This is the language we think, the specific language of Section 2255 and it is the holding of the Hayman case which petitioner relied upon initially in bringing the motion in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.917" offset="10119084">In the Hayman case, the issue was whether the movement's attorney had appeared as a counsel for a witness with the movement's knowledge and consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.646" offset="10169971">That particular issue was in no way reflected in the files and records of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.015" offset="10195466">And the Government in Hayman had conceded, in fact conceded that the factual issue required the presence of Hayman at a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.847" offset="10238725">The court in Hayman, this Court in Hayman specifically pointed out that a movement under Section 2255 does not have to be automatically produced in every proceeding but that his production depends upon the circumstances of each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.265" offset="10308420">The court recognized that Section 2255 permits summary dismissal if -- in the language of -- as I've said, the language of the Section said that the motion has been filed and the records in the case conclusively show that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2603.744" offset="10518340">Likewise the case which arose in the Sixth Circuit -- in the Johnson case, may I make just one reference to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.768" offset="10562435">The Johnson case at 239 F.2d 698 was a bank robbery case as this case, there was a 40-year sentence as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.622" offset="10625860">The motion under Section 2255 was filed seven years after conviction and it relied on Hayman and as in this case it alleged that through coercion and threats of the Assistant United States Attorney, Johnson was denied essential witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.012" offset="10703391">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in referring the denial of the motion without a hearing noted that the allocations followed a pattern which had become prevalent to enable convicts under long term sentences to obtain vacation, vacations from imprisonment by trumped up charges against their attorneys, against court officials and even district judges notwithstanding that said -- the Court of Appeals, it is incumbent upon the lower courts to follow the pronouncements of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.419" offset="10865037">But said the court and we quote this on page 42 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.966" offset="10895235">We cannot believe that the Supreme Court intended in its care case for the protection of human liberty to impose upon the inferior courts the duty of recalling years after action in criminal cases prisoners for rehearing based on obviously nebulous and false accusations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.177" offset="10988126">That reasoning is pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.074" offset="10995649">We think the very purpose of a hearing is to enable a court a court to arrive at the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.109" offset="11027832">The very purpose of Section 2255 was to prevent useless burdensome hearings where the record would show that the claims moved out the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.348" offset="11080808">And as our brief points out the other futility of the hearing is particularly apparent here where the allegations themselves ruled out the possibility that they should be corroborated.</text>
