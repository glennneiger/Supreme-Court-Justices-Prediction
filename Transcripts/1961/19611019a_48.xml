            <label>Mr. Sidney S. Sachs</label>
            <text syncTime="22.769" offset="194435">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.419" offset="201017">This is a proceeding under the Federal Employers' Liability Act which culminated by the direction of a verdict by the trial judge on the ground that the employee who had sued for his personal injuries had misrepresented as principally his physical condition when he procured employment seven years before this accident happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.638" offset="297880">There are two questions which are presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.003" offset="315434">The first is one which has been before the Court many times and which we will not argue unless asked to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.320" offset="348662">It is the question as to whether the evidence was of such a nature as to justify the courts depriving this man of his right to jury trial under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.535" offset="397563">The issue on which he ruled was fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.254" offset="416371">It is elementary of course that in order to establish that defense, the respondent had to show clearly that the employee had falsely misrepresented.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.215" offset="468198">Material facts with intention to deceive the railroad that in fact the railroad had relied on his misrepresentations and that it had been reasonable in so relying.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.571" offset="525667">This record is replete with inferences to be drawn from the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.182" offset="552103">The petitioner denied that he had a fraudulent intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.364" offset="568822">As to each of those elements and the sub-elements within each of them, there were questions for the jury under the principles which this Court had enumerate -- has enumerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.085" offset="615737">In fact, as to two of those issues, we submit, that the only reasonable inferences were favorable to the petitioner and in fact therefore, as to this one issue, there should have been a directed verdict in his favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.936" offset="683133">The novel question which this case presents is whether the defense of fraud in a case such as this, states a valid defense in any case, in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.962" offset="739244">This man briefly stating the facts which relate to that point was 24 years old when he was employed on July 24th, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.093" offset="791698">He was employed at Bluefield, West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.475" offset="805282">The record shows that he filed a written application on that day, on the form provided by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.742" offset="834330">On that day and apparently on the morning of the next day, he was physically examined by the respondent's medical examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.425" offset="869021">He answered all the questions on the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.814" offset="890650">He gave references.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.949" offset="899218">He gave the name for example of a veteran's administration -- of a doctor in Bluefield, a town of 20,000, who examined for the veteran's administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.626" offset="941850">The only investigation conducted by the respondent consisted of the medical examination which each -- which its examiner gave the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.958" offset="987199">That examiner said that it was a thorough examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.703" offset="1002141">He also said that at that time he was -- he had more than he could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.543" offset="1025546">He was crowded and had more than he could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.663" offset="1042056">There was in effect at the time of this application in 1951 a rule which is standard apparently among in the railroad industry and has been before this Court before, which -- which stated that, “Applications for employment will be accepted or rejected within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.349" offset="1140799">If not notified within 30 days, applicant will be considered as accepted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="266.111" offset="1167862">As I have said, the respondent made no investigation whatsoever of this applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.046" offset="1199522">It did not even ask him to produce his certificate of honorable discharge from the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.588" offset="1229720">May I digress just for one moment to state a fact that I should have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.138" offset="1255946">The critical omission which the respondent complains of was a low-back condition known as “spondylolisthesis” which the petitioner had for many years which apparently was congenital.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.177" offset="1320103">It was marked by a depression in his lower back which was visible to an examining doctor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="310.610" stopTime="315.450">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="310.610" offset="1345808">Do you mean a spondylolisthesis is visible to external view?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sidney_s_sachs" startTime="315.450" stopTime="592.811">
            <label>Mr. Sidney S. Sachs</label>
            <text syncTime="315.450" offset="1365138">I do not mean sir that that is true in every case, but this record shows that in this case there was evidence of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.240" offset="1400351">The testimony was that frequently the condition is marked -- it is indicated by an extreme Lordosis or some kind of a depression in the lower back which is -- which indicates the ailment and at least is sufficient to awaken the suspicions of an examining doctor who then certainly should procure an x-ray to confirm it.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.096" offset="1519783">The -- these are the essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.274" offset="1540472">I have given you the essential facts, I believe, which relate to this defense of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.144" offset="1575999">The trial court held as the respondent claims that this man was not an employee within the meaning of the Federal Employers' Liability Act and was not entitled to the protection of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.864" offset="1646843">The decision of this question really commences with the decision of this Court in Minneapolis, and -- Minneapolis, St. Pete -- St. Paul &amp; Sault Ste. Marie Railroad Company versus Rock, which was decided in 1929 by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.084" offset="1731688">In that case a man named Joe -- the facts there, it's important to understand those facts in order to compare them to those with petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.767" offset="1766484">There, a man named Joe Rock applied for work with the Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.638" offset="1781948">He failed the examination for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.192" offset="1796159">A few days later using the name of John Rock, he applied again for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.030" offset="1823535">And he obtained a friend of his, a third party entirely, to submit to the physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.566" offset="1849657">The medical examiner examined Joe Rock's friend, thought he was John Rock and passed the exam -- passed the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.508" offset="1893439">Joe Rock under the name John Rock then commenced to work for the Railroad and about 15 months later he was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.321" offset="1924681">This Court reversed a verdict in favor of the petitioner in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.783" offset="1954461">It held essentially as I understand the opinion that what Rock had done was so abhorrent to the public policy of the FELA that he -- although he may have been an employee he was not an employee within the meaning of this Act and was not entitled to the protection which the Act afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.598" offset="2057801">The Court did not discuss the case in terms of common law contract in fraud principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.706" offset="2090193">It did not discuss the basic proposition that any contract is -- which is induced by fraud is voidable not void.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.767" offset="2138467">That a contract is void, a contract of employment for example when the employer hires one other than he thinks it is employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.802" offset="2186533">The -- the nub of the opinion as I have said lie in the Court's statement that the purpose of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, one of the principal purposes, is to provide -- is to provide safety for the employees and the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.047" offset="2271587">That the machinery for providing that safety is the -- personally, one of the principle machineries at least is the personal injury action which is afforded the injured worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.104" offset="2319757">And because of the threat of that, there is a stimulus built into the Act for the railroad to be careful in its hiring procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.554" offset="2353612">And so the Court said in that case and in another case involving the same Railroad a few years later, it paraphrased the Rock holding by saying that the nub -- that the point of the Rock case was that Rock have fraudulently evaded the company's rule requiring applicants to submit to a physical examination, that was why Rock lost.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.877" offset="2514840">In other words, in this case here we have, as I understand to your position, we have disputed facts as to whether or not there was any misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.528" offset="2549530">In the Rock case, were the facts, and it's your position that at the very least, these controversies of fact ought to be submitted to a jury?</text>

            <text syncTime="623.967" offset="2599267">In the Rock case, were there disputed facts?</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="628.736" offset="2618284">So that in the Rock case, you would concede, at least argumentatively that in that kind of a case perhaps it was open to the Court to decide as a matter of law, when the facts were not disputed, that the plaintiff in that case had procured somebody else in fact to take his physical examination and maybe in that kind of extreme case, there was nothing for the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.188" offset="2740120">That does not state our principal contention as we state it.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.443" offset="2757151">We think there is a greater difference than that between the Rock case and this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney S. Sachs</label>
            <text syncTime="674.462" offset="2801246">For the reason, and that is the point that I'm now coming to.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.080" offset="2815666">The fraud, if there was a fraud and we don't concede it, that still perpetrated on the Norfolk and Western Railroad did not keep it from examining him.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.641" offset="2857984">It did not set to note as this Court said in the Rock case, the railroad's practice and procedure which it had set up in order to carry out its duty to hire competent employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.045" offset="2919528">In the Rock case, the Court said, “A Railroad has a duty to hire competent employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="709.926" offset="2943039">Rock thwarted that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.753" offset="2950353">It made it impossible in that case for the Railroad to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.423" offset="2969057">Now, I would like to say to the Court that the Rock case has been criticized.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.490" offset="2993298">Today for instance, in candor, it seems to me and -- it maybe said that what I say now is somewhat contrary to our position but I don't think it is, that today, the Court might even find in the Rock case that he should have recovered because for example, fingerprints would have prevented the kind of a fraud that Rock perpetrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.942" offset="3091101">That would leave the case as one, not too distinguishable formalities, but that wasn't discussed in the Rock case and therefore in our case we come, I submit, clearly within the basic rule that there was nothing more here than -- if you concede what we don't concede, than a fraud in the inducement which possibly gave the Railroad the right to fire Still, but not to deprive him of his protection as an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.929" offset="3227042">I may say to Your Honors that in December 1959, following the trial of this case, there was a hearing pursuant to the terms of the original contract in which he was fired for the misrepresentations which are the subject matter of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.336" offset="3300707">I would like to make one additional point, and that is that unless the Court finds that the defense raised in this case, this fraud defense, is inappropriate in such a situation, the result will be to thwart the very public policy which the Court relied upon in ruling as it did in the Rock case.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.508" offset="3421393">Because if any misrepresentation, easily discoverable at the time of hiring is to be allowed to the Railroad as a defense, when an injury occurs years after, an employee has undertaken his work with the Railroad, the only result can be to generate a feeling of confidence, a laxity if you will, in the hiring procedures, which the railroad will follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.737" offset="3566320">Therefore, we submit that the -- the basic policy of the FELA calls of a decision in the petitioner's favor on both these issues -- on the second issue, we think we're right also in the first.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.298" offset="4168600">This case, if the Court please, is unlike most of the FELA cases in that in this case the facts were substantially un-contradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.096" offset="4215724">It's an unusual thing, but that is a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.491" offset="4245295">Our friend, I think will agree with me except on one point, he will say that there was a conflict in the evidence in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.909" offset="4295032">He will say that when the plaintiff, the petitioner applied for employment to the respondent in 1951, and after he had filled out himself and signed a written application for employment, he was examined by the medical examiner for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.913" offset="4411016">The medical examiner testified that he inquired, asked the petitioner many questions appearing on the physical examination card, and recorded those answers as written, and that card is in evidence in the case, but here is the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.149" offset="4523969">The petitioner at that time at one place in his testimony denied that the medical examiner asked him any questions, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.205" offset="4572244">However, in other parts of his testimony, it is entirely clear that the medical examiner did interrogate him, did ask him questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.884" offset="4622921">He stated he did not remember what the conversation was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.834" offset="4650715">But it must be remembered that he was examined in July of 1951 by the medical examiner and this case was not tried and until October of 1959 more than eight years following that examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.293" offset="4752593">Then, I make this statement and I make it advisedly, I submit that when the petitioner testifies that he remembered the conversation occurring and remember that no conversation did occur at that examination which he successfully passed, that when he testified that he remembered that no questions were asked him by the medical examiner on that occasion, I submit that that testimony is incredible and unworthy of belief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.717" offset="4974216">And had he said anything else, I think I would have been embarrassed because I would have known or I certainly would have thought that he was telling an untruth, then I think that most anyone else would come to that conclusion, medical examiner get on understand and testified that he remembered the conversation that occurred when he gave a physical examination eight years ago, when nothing unusual occurred at the examination to impress it on his memory, I would have very serious doubts about the credibility of that medical examiner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.232" offset="5348289">I don't believe -- of course my opinion is immaterial, but I submit that no person regardless of his intellect or his memory, who took an examination say for life insurance eight years ago and successfully passed that examination, and nothing unusual occurred at that examination to impress that on his memory, I would say that it is incredible for him to attempt to testify what was said by the medical examiner and what was said by him during that examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.677" offset="5538043">And not only that, within this case, we're not dealing with a man with that kind of a memory because he himself admits and testified at one place where he said, “I can hardly remember 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.367" offset="5628844">I can hardly remember what happened in 1958.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.649" offset="5649951">He had been employed on two previous occasions by respondent; one time in 1943 and one time in 1948, he passed those examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.321" offset="5712645">He made the same false representations on those occasions that he made in 1951 and that isn't denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.294" offset="5752560">He simply says, “I don't remember being examined in 1943 and 1948,” but in view of those things, first, the fact that he was testifying to an occurrence that occurred more than eight years before the trial and the second, he has admitted lack of memory, his very poor memory, I submit sincerely that that type of evidence is incredible and I know the courts in many instances say that testimony is incredible and that the jury is not justified in believing incredible testimony and the court shouldn't permit a jury to believe him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.352" offset="5948792">But, with that exception, my friend will say that that is a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.710" offset="5970213">I say it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.296" offset="5976586">It's properly analyzed and considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.039" offset="5991528">There is no substantial conflict in the testimony in this case and that's unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.864" offset="6026846">Now, when the petitioner, he had this condition of his back, the spondylolisthesis, which is probably congenital, he was inducted into the army in 1945 and he was examined by an army doctor and he passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.223" offset="6120260">So apparently, the army doctor didn't discover this condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.714" offset="6134262">He was taken into the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.244" offset="6148368">He served for a few months and then he went to the hospital complaining of severe pain in his back and subsequently, he was given a medical discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.283" offset="6196537">It was found that he could not be rehabilitated to perform military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.653" offset="6217958">He was given a medical discharge in January 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.329" offset="6244707">Prior to that time, he'd also been involved in an automobile accident and injured his back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.901" offset="6275009">And in many places in his testimony, he attributed his discharge from the army, his medical discharge, to that back injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.382" offset="6316910">He had also been afflicted with seriously disabling rheumatism for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.472" offset="6357243">That was the situation when he made application to the respondent for employment as a yard breaker and I might add this, that a year or two prior to that, he had been employed by another coal company as a mine breaker and had had to quit work on account of a physical disability, worked about a month.</text>
