            <text syncTime="20.224" offset="185323">If the Court please, this case is here on writ of certiorari from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida to review the constitutional validity of that judgment which affirmed the conviction of petitioner for contempt and sends him to six months imprisonment and fine for refusing to obey a court order which required him to bring to the hearings of the respondent Committee the membership list of his organization for the purpose of validating the inquiries, his answers to inquiries concerning the associational relationship of persons alleged to be subversive with the NAACP to which he belonged.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.879" offset="403916">As we see the issue, if the Court please, the basic question in this case is whether the facts and circumstances of this particular case place it within the orbit of NAACP versus Alabama and Bates versus Little Rock and pertinent cases of whether there is an overriding state interest which is sufficient to enable the state to pierce the constitutional protection and therefore that the doctrines of Barenblatt, Uphaus, Wilkinson and Braden and Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.202" offset="545186">We contend, of course, that the -- this issue -- this situation is unlike the latter cases and that on the facts, although the facts are somewhat different but that the law -- the same application of the law which this Court applied in NAACP versus Alabama is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.803" offset="631599">The facts are somewhat of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.730" offset="659289">On November 4th and 5th of 1959, the respondent Committee held hearings in Tallahassee, Alabama and Tallahassee, Florida an issue to subpoena duces tecum to petitioner and others requiring them to bring all records in respect to the membership list of persons in the NAACP in Mi -- in Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.312" offset="765659">The petitioner and other persons appeared and at the outset of the hearing, the chairman read the statute which gave the Committee authority and that statute is set out on pages two and three of our brief, brief for petitioner, and then he made a statement that the hearing was concerned with the activities of various organizations operating in Florida in the field of race relations, coercive reform of social and educational practices in more ways by litigation and pressured administrative action.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.841" offset="1223743">The investigator of the Committee proceeded to testify that there were some 14 persons who he met, set out in detail whom on his investigation were members of the Communist Party or were active in subversive organizations and were according to the information of the Committee, members or had been active in the Miami branch of the NAACP He also named some 33 other persons who he indicated had been in Florida at the present time or were -- or is engaged in this subversive activities and on the basis of the Committee statement investigation were active in the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.997" offset="1388419">Petitioner was then called and he stated that he was the custodian of the membership list that he had -- the membership list of the branch was in his custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.247" offset="1437424">That membership in the organization was on a year-to-year basis that he had been present in the organization for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.384" offset="1465950">He pointed out that the organization had adopted a -- an affirmative anti-Communist policy in its 1950 Convention and had repeated it thereafter which barred Communists from the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.942" offset="1520180">And he indicated in answer to questions from the Committee counsel that he would be willing to testify of his own knowledge as to whether various persons who were named and alleged to be by the Committee subversives, as to whether those people were in fact members of the organization but he would not and he had not brought the membership list and he would not -- and refused to validate his testimony against the membership list itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.220" offset="1653300">After -- in the course of the testimony, he was shown pictures of some of these 14 persons I have mentioned and each instance he -- his statement was that some of the people he recognized and some he did not but that he would -- that he had no knowledge if they had been members of the organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.990" offset="1992370">He did not refuse to -- I might, in all honesty and in fairness, I might indicate that the petitioner position on this was that the 14 people who were named and some 33 apparently in terms of -- where there was no reason on his part to believe or to disbelieve the Committee statement that were in fact subversive, he proceeded to testify and to indicate as to whether they were members of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.499" offset="2122355">In each instance as I indicated, he said, “No,” but there did come a time when the Committee named a particular person, Reverend Graham who's in a companion case to this which we have appended as Appendix B in our brief, in our petition in which petitioner asked the Committee why this statement was pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.767" offset="2219426">And they did -- at the first hearing, they refused to cont -- to carry on with it and at the second hearing in July 27th, they did state that he had -- they had reason to believe that he was a member of the Communist Party or active in subversive activities but petitioner persisted in his refusal to det -- to this -- to tell them whether or not he was a member of the -- whether or not he was a member of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.162" offset="2309078">But I suppose that the more accurate statement of petitioner's position is that where he has reason to doubt, that where he had reason to doubt that what the Committee said was in fact true with respect to the subversive connections of these particular people about information they wanted that he would to refuse to answer but where he had no reason to doubt or to question their statement then he was answering the question out of his knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="892.863" offset="3675805">So that I think that by he's bringing the list there, the state has produced the very thing which would make it possible to say that it -- it may or have the -- the entire membership list without a violation of the (Inaudible) of rights or a violation of the doctrine in NAACP versus Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.037" offset="3800566">Well, Mr. Justice Black, my contention is that the state has no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.682" offset="3823135">It has no override -- it has no interest at all, but that if under the -- under the opinion of the Alabama Supreme Court in its apparent seeming innocence, if the petitioner produces the membership list at the Committee hearing in order to testi -- to authenticate his answers to whether or not various persons or members of the party or members of the -- of the party or members of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.699" offset="3939224">My contention is that a sequence of the events are put in motion which may compel the production of the list, one that the state in might disbelieve him and therefore the Committee in terms of prosecuting him for perjury would -- may have then a right to see the list to determine whether he's lied or petitioner in order to defend himself against charges of the perjury maybe required to produce the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.193" offset="4033160">And therefore, my argument is that on these basis, I see no real difference between the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida, saying that the list maybe -- may not be disclosed, but he may testify from it and the actual production of the list, which this Court forbade in NAACP versus Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.563" offset="4266695">The next day, I think the hearing closed as I recall, the hearing closed that day and the next day, the -- Mr. Arlington Sands was produced and Mr. Sands testified that he had been a member of the branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.089" offset="4348719">He said that his membership -- rather his official capacity of the branch predated 1950 that he didn't really know whether he was a member now or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.320" offset="4389679">He hasn't been to a meeting in two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.978" offset="4400337">As he began to testify about these 14 people whom the investigator had indicated were members of the Communist Party and also members of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.908" offset="4452059">In almost every instance except one, he indicated that he did not know whether these persons were members of -- were members of a subversive group and were members of the NAACP.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.634" offset="4514962">I think in one or two instances, he indicated that one person while he was an officer, he had invited him to attend the meeting or he was a lawyer, but he denied the fact that this person was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.101" offset="4572850">Now, we contend that the investigator was then brought back to impeach this testimony and it was indicated that the investigator had talked to this Mr. -- Mr. Sands at the Wednesday before the hearing alone in a room with him and that therefore it was -- what he said was his word against the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.075" offset="4672742">But we contend therefore, that the only witness produced at this hearing who had any -- who could've had any personal knowledge about the facts to which they are testifying isn't all in consent that it is clear from his testimony that any evidence or facts that he had predated 1950 and that therefore that the people about whom they were asking, the 14 people and so that they were asking him about were persons that may or might have had some connection with the organization in 1950 or before 1950 and that -- Mr. Sands had himself had not been active in the organization since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.976" offset="4840344">So that we think that this testimony is in itself insubstantial in -- to provide any connection, present connection and for that matter any past connection between the organization and subversive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.239" offset="4917352">At the close of -- when Mr. Sands was finished, there were several other witnesses connected with the organization and testified and were shown these various persons' pictures and for the most part, they did not having seen them at any meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.816" offset="4975658">They all denied that they to their knowledge that they knew whether these persons were members of the organization and in some instances they indicated that these persons might -- that they might have seen these persons at meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.433" offset="5022156">And then the petitioner was brought back and he was asked how the anti-Communist policy of the organization was implemented and he pointed out investigations that were made of officers to be sure that there are no officers who are members of the party, who are the officers of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.070" offset="5100628">And that if any -- there's any evidence of any person being engaged in any activity, any rank and file member that steps were taken to reject that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.963" offset="5140229">But he was again asked to produce the membership list for the first purpose of authenticating his testimony and he again refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.055" offset="5176592">And then the Committee as the statute authorizes, sought a rule nisi in the Circuit Court in Florida to require the person -- the petitioner to show cause why he should not produce the membership list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.293" offset="5257571">And there was a hearing at that -- on that order to show cause and at this hearing, the petitioner produced evidence, showing that the disclosure of the names of the NAACP members might result in reprisals and harm, economic and physical harm, attempted to proffer testimony into -- indicating that the persons at the Committee whom the Committee was interested had not been or were not residents of Florida any longer and that the Committee really had no knowledge, no knowledge in its -- or no evidence in its files that these persons allegedly Communist were members of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.277" offset="5453490">This, the Court refused to permit interrogation of the Committee chairman and the investigator for the Committee for that purpose but a proffer was offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.290" offset="5513571">The petitioner was ordered to appear again before the Committee and to give the evidence and the petitioner refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.736" offset="5547321">He went before the Committee but again refused and subsequent to that there was a hearing he was convicted of contempt on sentences I have indicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1899.265" offset="7701483">So that the case I put to you isn't exactly this case, but your answer will shed some light at least to me on your contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.370" offset="7737846">Suppose instead of this kind of an investigation, we had a totally different case that these 14 men, who were, according to the record in this case, authenticated or identified Communists, suppose you didn't have that situation, but these 14 men were named in some publication as Communists or charged with being Communists and they there -- because of that -- on that -- on the basis of that publication brought a libel suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.955" offset="7892177">I don't know if the law applies this but certainly the law of good many states charged a man of being a Communist is libelous if the plaintiff can disapprove that because the plaintiff says he isn't and no proof can be made that he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.609" offset="7954871">Let us assume that in Florida to charge a man with being a Communist is a libelous accusation and these 14 men bring a libel suit against the publication so charging one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.626" offset="8018923">The defense is that in order or it appears in the course of the -- of the trial that the defense claimed that in order to conceal to -- to cover up and camouflage their Communist affiliation they sought and became members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.610" offset="8122786">They were due paying members of the local branch of the NAACP as a cover for their activities as Communist on the basis that all right-minded people know that the NAACP is not a Communist or a Communist connected or affiliated or sympathetic organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.734" offset="8215364">And the plaintiff then puts on the stand the custodian of this -- of -- of the NAACP as here and asked him on direct examination whether naming them or any of them was in fact a member of the NAACP, was a registered member on the books of the NAACP and he forthrightly says quite clearly, “No, of my own knowledge, I'm able to swear that they're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.321" offset="8361650">They do not belong to the NAACP branch.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.704" offset="8375233">On cross-examination, the defendant saying all human memory is treacherous and asked him to produce the membership list and examine the list in order to verify the correctness of his memory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.648" offset="8463005">And he declines and a subpoena issues, and the subpoena is -- is disobeyed and then the question arises whether the Court has compulsory power to compel the custodian to produce that list not with the view of disclosing it, the list as such, not with the view of putting the list in the possession of counsel for the plaintiff, not with the view of even having the Court examine the list but counsel for defendant on cross-examination being a rigorous cross-examine says I -- just to ask you to turn the pages of your membership list and now tell me after you've done whether you adhere to your testimony or all your testimony unaided by any reference to the record that these 14 people are not members of your organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="3446.484" offset="13890309">I am just overcoming a severe sinus attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.461" offset="13910267">I'll try to stand in form of the facts with one opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.247" offset="13921343">If I -- opinion is too much please, indicate it out (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.881" offset="13947883">If I may at the outset begin my back -- my argument back with Your Honors, in answer to Mr. Justice Hugo Black's question as to whether or not we could've called the alleged subversives, I would like to direct, Your Honors' attention to the fact that we did call some of the alleged subversives in this case and before we called the petitioner Gibson, we called a Communist Party member Abe Sorokin to the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.272" offset="14081526">This appears, beginning at the record on page 22, you will find -- beginning actually on 19 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.943" offset="14132203">I call Mr. Sorkin to the stand and Mr. Sorokin declined to answer any question I asked him asserting his absolute privilege of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.770" offset="14175462">Among the questions I asked Mr. Sorokin and this was before we called petitioner Gibson was, “Mr. Sorokin, are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party of United States?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.508" offset="14226453">He declined to answer that on the ground of the Fifth Amendment and other constitutional privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.741" offset="14251321">I asked him if he -- “Have you now -- have you indeed in the County of Florida been a member of the Communist Party of the United States?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.644" offset="14314956">That question he declined on the same ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.566" offset="14314851">I asked him, “Are you now or have you ever been a member of the NAACP in Miami-Dade County, Florida?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.799" offset="14331570">I asked him, “Is it true that you are -- that you were in fact a member of the NAACP and that you joined it at the direction of the Communist Party of the United States?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.828" offset="14371694">That question Mr. Sorokin declined to answer on the grounds among other than his Fifth Amendment rights which gave him an absolute privilege on all of the decisions of our own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.534" offset="14418505">Now then Your Honor, my Committee investigator testified point blank that Mr. Sorikin was a member of the Communist Party and gave his Communist party card number.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.988" offset="14472317">Mr. Sorikin is one of the men about whom we asked the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.216" offset="14489245">Of course, we have received the same response to every Communist Party member that we have called used the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.129" offset="14520905">We called in this particular hearing other party members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.434" offset="14538146">I think you'll find Benny -- a witness named Benny Stellar was called in this case and asked him, we got the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.086" offset="14576703">So, actually we tried to pursue the notion of getting this information from the witnesses themselves or the subversives themselves and we ran into a blank wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.279" offset="14629470">If I may say Your Honors, the only issue before the Court in this case is on -- and clearly that del -- delineated on page 17 of the petitioner's writ for certiorari and the first two sentences of the paragraph beginning just above the middle of that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.723" offset="14719331">And this is the issue which is stated by the petitioner and which I accept as a true issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3662.772" offset="14755485">Page 17 of the petition for writ, Mr. Justice Whittaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.534" offset="14778577">The issue is not whether petitioner is compelled to disclose the entire membership list of the NAACP or even on the names of some members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.138" offset="14824970">The issue is whether petitioner can be compelled to produce his organization's membership list to testify concerning any persons, association or status and I -- in the line there, if Your Honors please, under any conceivable conditions ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.275" offset="14917548">What you're being asked to do in this case is precisely what you were asked to do in the Barenblatt case and what you failed to do in that case is to erect a constitutional sanctuary of absolute immunity around people engaged in a particular activity or belonging to a certain class or association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.382" offset="15029875">In the Barenblatt case, Your Honor, will ask a whole that a person belonging to the educational field cannot be interrogated about Communist activities on the ground, of course, of -- not only First Amendment freedom of associational rights but I think freedom, academic freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.510" offset="15118482">Now, if you will turn to the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida in the appendix of the petitioner's petition for writ of certiorari at page 28, I may say to you Your Honors that Mr. Justice Thornal of the Supreme Court of Florida is one of the brainiest constitutional lawyers I have ever encountered in my experience as a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.445" offset="15254215">Mr. Justice Thornal held in these two opinions which are attached to this appendix that we could not compel the other witness Graeme to testify about the membership of these same people in the NAACP because we had the petitioner, the custodian of the records there that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.516" offset="15346479">And Mr. Justice Thornal in the Supreme Court of Florida exonerated the appellant Graeme from a contempt conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.790" offset="15379602">He declined to answer any questions on the grounds that we had the custodian of the records here who could give us this information, Gibson in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.824" offset="15419726">Now if you will look at Mr. Justice Thornal's opinion, you will find, beginning on page 25 and he says that if the factual situation were analogous, at the bottom of the page, the NAACP versus Alabama, the Supreme Court of Florida would of course honor Your Honors' decision in that case and reversed the conviction of this man, but he finds the facts are markedly different as they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.048" offset="15552637">On page 27 of the appendix, in the middle of the page, he finds that as in the Uphaus case, this record unequivocally reports that members of the Communist Party and members of the affiliates -- of its affiliates have on various occasions attended meetings or participated in the affairs of the NAACP in Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.811" offset="15643648">That appears in this record as Judge Thornal says it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.079" offset="15660680">On the top of page 28 of the appendix on his opinion, he finds that what the appellant is really asking is that they construct a constitutional city of refuge which opens its precincts to those who seek to speak freely and assemble righteously in their advocacy of their just causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.107" offset="15744794">And in doing so however, he would have us provide ideological asylum for those who would destroy by a violence the very foundation upon which their governmental sanctuary stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.509" offset="15794427">An appeal so ideological he thinks cannot make judicial sanctuary and if Your Honors please, they have no dispute between counsel for the petitioner and myself as to the law of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.584" offset="15850747">This is purely and simply a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.657" offset="15867047">If there is any evidence in this record sufficient to show probable cause to believe that subversive persons have been associated with the NAACP in Dade County, Florida then this case falls under the rational of Your Honors' decisions in Barenblatt, Wilkinson, Braden and Uphaus and the petitioner's conviction should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.679" offset="15987106">If you find that there is no evidence in this record to show that we have any Communist in Dade County who have been or may have been participating in the NAACP's meetings and decisions down there, if you find that as purely a figment of the imagination of the Committee from the record then of course you should reverse the conviction of the appellant of the petitioner and set him free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.335" offset="16097761">In that connection, we all know and we have discussed in today that some 51 people altogether were identified in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.843" offset="16147811">I want to call Your Honors' attention to one other piece of evidence in this case which in most material to the consideration of the nexus between subversive activities in the NAACP or as counsel referred to in a moment ago in answer to your question Mr. Justice Black, the connecting link.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.622" offset="16238926">If you will look on pages 119 and 120 of the record, you will find the piece of evidence there which in my judgment is absolutely sufficient to justify the investigation which the Committee undertook and which the Courts of Florida have upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.974" offset="16328265">Here's an anti-Communism resolution brought by the petitioner himself to the Committee's hearing and of course which we've already possessed up when we started this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.584" offset="16382704">If you will look at pages 16 and 17 of my brief, I quote that resolution there and I have italicized for the Court's convenience certain portions of that resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.705" offset="16443204">I set this resolution out setting -- starting on page 16 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.531" offset="16462535">And this is a resolution which by the petitioner it is admitted was passed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People no later than its last national convention last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.661" offset="16514988">And it says starting out where certain branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People are being wrecked by internal conflicts between groups who follow the Communist line and those who do not and going on in that paragraph to say that that thing asserts that it's threatening to disrupt the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.719" offset="16615299">In the next paragraph, and whereas it is apparent from numerous attacks by Communist in their official argument, the daily workman, the political affairs that there is a well-organized nationwide conspiracy by Communists either to capture or split and wreck the NAACP and incidentally we have shown this by independent evidence in other hearings, they recognize that it is a name of the N.A.A.C. -- of the Communist Party to penetrate and capture their organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.170" offset="16757091">And they resolved in the next paragraph Your Honor that they go on the record as against the Communist and here, we have called upon and direct and instruct the National Board of the Directors to appoint a Committee to investigate and study the ideological composition in terms of the membership and leadership of the local units with the view to determining the causes of these things and then they instruct and resolve that that Board shall have a necessary authority to investigate such infiltration and if necessary suspend, reorganize and ban a local branch of the NAACP that's been infiltrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.430" offset="16954159">In other words, the National Convention and Solemn Convention assumed has found that some of their branches are so infiltrated that they themselves had set up an investigating committee to cope with the situation, and if that is true Your Honors and that evidence comes from the petitioner himself, “Why wouldn't the State of Florida show that there's at least 50 some odd communist in Dade County in close proximity to the Miami Branch down there?</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.359" offset="17109849">Why can the State of Florida not determine whether or not that situation exist in the Miami Branch so that we may determine whether or not it's necessary that we legislate in whatever area Your Honors have left to us to control, sedition directed against the State of Florida and against seditions directed against the United States Government under the Nelson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.974" offset="17232311">That is purely and simply, Your Honors, a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.849" offset="17251746">The record abounds and I say supports clearly the state's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.395" offset="17286019">The record sets the Uphaus decision in motion, the Barenblatt decision, the Wilkinson decision and the Braden decision in motion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.518" offset="17330427">Your Honors, we were not pursuing Reverend Gibson in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.928" offset="17348086">If you will look at this record, you will see I gave him at least three or four opportunities to purge himself to comply with our request in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.477" offset="17390299">We didn't want that Reverend Gibson (Inaudible) in this case, we wanted the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.163" offset="17417049">This case has been to the Supreme Court of Florida on two occasions before it ever reached Your Honors' doorsteps.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.405" offset="17445992">You will find that the fair conclusion of this entire hearing, I called him back to the stand after he had repeatedly refused to comply with the order of the Committee and asked him again if he wouldn't comply with the order of the Committee after calling his attention to the fact that there were some names that he wouldn't recognize out of the thousand names, that he didn't know all the members of his branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.213" offset="17545258">He admitted, if you will look at the record that he didn't know all the members of his branch and that he wouldn't associate a name with the face sometimes and yet, he wouldn't comply with the order -- the Committee or the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4818.326" offset="19377695">Well, if I may -- because I think that the statement that Mr. Hawes made really succinctly places the problem before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.586" offset="19446763">Mr. Hawes says that the Committee doesn't want to stop every time if they asked whether a person is a member of the party and the person decides to stand on his constitutional rights, but it seems to us, if the Court please that this is the -- this is a particular issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.341" offset="19505800">The fact that the constitutional guarantees remain make -- that the Committee cannot violate the constitutional guarantees and cannot freely violate constitutional guarantees is the very reason for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.980" offset="19564314">And that -- therefore, in this particular case, as we pointed out, we think that we had demonstrated that we think that the evidence in this case demonstrates that there is no reasonable connection between the demand for this -- for what is being demanded in any legislative purpose that the -- that this Committee is -- is investigating to determine whether or not that certain persons alleged to be members of the Communist Party or members of the -- of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.417" offset="19694090">And as a matter of fact, what do they do with this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.514" offset="19706420">Can they pass a law barring that members of the Communist Party be in the organization?</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.383" offset="19725960">If in fact the -- what they have to do in order to -- to attack the organization and to lay a foundation for making the kind of investigation which I think -- which I -- as I understand that the decisions of this Court, there would have to be some showing that the organization itself is involved in some kind of activity of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.611" offset="19810806">Now, as we attempted to point out in this brief and show to the comm -- I mean in -- for all these hearings and show to the Committee the organization, as most organizations of its kind were -- attempted to take care of the -- of the problems within it by the resolutions which -- which were adopted and by following it, implementing it and therefore, being sure that there were no subversives in the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.121" offset="19920833">The testimony in the record reveals that the persons who were in charged with this, with -- and implementing these resolutions stated that there are no Communists in the Miami Branch and that they have no evidence of any being there.</text>

            <text syncTime="5292.603" offset="21274812">Now -- now, that -- if -- if we take those facts as true, it's difficult for me to see where in it can be differentiated from Uphaus.</text>

            <text syncTime="5302.350" offset="21313787">Well, I think that -- that the facts are that an investigator, a person who investi -- who are alleged to be investigator, who was shown to have talked to the witness saying -- testified that his -- his evidence showed that these people were -- were members of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.451" offset="21382228">But Sands himself, the personal witness came on the witness stand and testified, one, that most of these people were not members of the Communist Party to his own knowledge and two, that they were not members of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.601" offset="21426845">So that our -- our contention is that the -- the evidentiary basis which they were attempting to establish has been taken away from them by their own witness.</text>
