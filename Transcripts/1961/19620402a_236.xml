            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">If Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.146" offset="252008">The facts of this case insofar as they are constitutionally pertinent, I think are uncontradicted and I think they're undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.173" offset="304044">The brother of the petitioner, one Joseph Lanza had been arrested under warrant charging him with violation of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.729" offset="342288">He had been placed in jail in Westchester County by the officials of State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.351" offset="372799">At the request of the Parole Board officials, an electronic recording device was concealed in the room in the jail, in the prison which was used by the prisoner to meet and consult with his relatives, his friends and his attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.120" offset="463809">The record shows and this is pointed out for some reason, in the people's brief, that there was another room in the prison which was set aside exclusively for attorneys and that room was free of this electronic eavesdropping device but obviously, neither the prisoner or anybody who came to visit him could select the room in which he's going to see them when the prisoner -- and when the wife of the prisoner, his attorney and the petitioner here and his brother came to visit him on separate occasions, he was brought -- they were brought into this room where the electronic device had been planted as a trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.232" offset="652309">On the basis of this electronic device, conversations which were had between the prisoner, his wife, his attorney and the petitioner here and his brother were recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.777" offset="706435">Thereafter, the pet -- the prisoner was released on parole by a member of the New York State Parole Board and the circumstances which gave rise to that release caused a State Investigating Committee to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.778" offset="774457">In the course of this investigation, the prisoner, the petitioner's brother; his wife, the attorney and the petitioner herein were on separate occasions called before the investigating committee and were interrogated regarding any efforts which they have been -- might have made to use, influence or corrupt beings to obtain the restoration of parole of the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.998" offset="899323">Each one of the four refused to answer the questions put to them by the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.889" offset="934954">No action was taken against any of the other three except that an effort was made to punish the attorney for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.244" offset="968391">But that was dismissed by the courts and no -- nothing further was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.692" offset="994095">No prosecution was brought against either the prisoner himself, the petitioner's brother or his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.748" offset="1022412">However, the petitioner was prosecuted under a New York statute which makes it a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for up to one year for refusal to ask -- to answer a pertinent question, a material of proper question put to it by a legislative committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.169" offset="1100048">The petitioner was tried and 19 questions had been put before him by the counsel for the legislative committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.753" offset="1138395">He refused to answer each one of these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.667" offset="1154069">He was -- and that had been prosecuted on 19 separate counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.381" offset="1172877">He was found guilty of all counts, in all counts but the -- and sentenced for the full time of one year on each count.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.518" offset="1189491">But tampering justice with mercy -- with mercy, the sentencing judge provided that nine of the sentences would be served concurrently with the other 10 which would be served consecutively so that he was sentenced for this refusal to answer on the base of this one short conversation with sentence to 10 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.472" offset="1305266">The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction but modified the judgement by reducing the sentence to one year stating that irrespective of whether he had been guilty of one crime or 19 crimes or any amount in between.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.617" offset="1373811">As a matter of discretion they would remove -- reduce the judgement to be served for -- to one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.885" offset="1402964">The Court of Appeals by a narrow margin of four to three, affirmed the conviction although it modified the judgement further to provide that only one crime had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.616" offset="1457821">Nevertheless, it said that the Appellate Division had indicated in his discretion that -- that matches every year and therefore, didn't change the actual sentence but simply declared that he's been guilty of only one crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.548" offset="1513514">Three of the judges were of the opinion that by reason of the circumstances whereby the information which the questioning was based, these questions could not be deemed to be proper whether the meaning of the penal law which provides the failure to answer a material and proper question constitutes a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.107" offset="1607764">And that -- that's my state -- well, that is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.847" offset="1638797">Contending as we have done in all the courts below, that the petitioner's constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment that's made applicable to states, the Fourteenth had been violated, we sought certiorari and certiorari was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.512" offset="1713403">We based our case on two interrelated contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.366" offset="1744854">We assert that by reason of the circumstances of this case, the defendant or the petitioner was deprived of his liberty without due process of law, within the -- meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment as it is operated by its own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.511" offset="1813400">Second, we urged that this conduct on the part of the State of New York would if it had been committed by federal officials been the violation of the Fourth Amendment and that accordingly it is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and that in either case whether it's Fourteenth Amendment by reason of its own operation or by reason of its relationship to the Fourth, renders unusable by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.826" offset="1934712">The information gained through this electronic eavesdropping device and that any questions placed thereon could not be or shouldn't answer any questions based thereon could not be the subject for criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.508" offset="1993435">Now, the people of the State -- the people of the State of New York in their brief, the first point, urged that only 17 of the 19 questions were corrupted and that the first and the 19th which were general questions, which simply stated, state what -- what efforts were made by you on behalf of your brother is the first question and the second question was -- the first question was, on February 5th 1957, your brother Joseph Lanza was arrested and returned to prison, charged with the violation of parole, told the commission -- committee please, any and all efforts extended by you to assist in obtaining the release of your brother Joseph Lanza on parole or the restoration of his parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.071" offset="2191653">That was the first question.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.397" offset="2196982">Last question was another catch-all general question, Mr. Lanza, please tell the committee the name of anyone with whom you spoke to in the month of February of 1957 about the restoration of the parole of your brother Joseph Lanza.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.655" offset="2245987">It's our contention that these questions are as corrupt as the other 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.608" offset="2277752">That but for the fact of the electronic device, there would have been never any occasion, no occasion whatsoever to call the petitioner herein before the legislative committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.021" offset="2331460">The record shows that the petitioner was a person, a responsible businessman, who had never been before a lower court, perhaps maybe a traffic violation but never been before a lower court much less having a criminal record of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.476" offset="2389243">He had no bouts with the law, a reputable businessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.295" offset="2404603">His only relationship to the petitioner herein and to the controversy was in, was a fact that he was a brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.845" offset="2430725">Now, it is true --</text>

            <text syncTime="595.269" offset="2484433">It was done by the Parole Board but as we urged, it's a same respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.589" offset="2501778">There's only one respondent here, the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.788" offset="2510555">And that the -- the -- and we quote on opinion by -- in the Silverthorne case as well as another, is the fact that the -- the State of New York through its legislative committee took advantage of the electronic eavesdropping which had been committed by the Parole Board, in effect ratified it, made it part of this as itself.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="647.468" offset="2693204">I would say this Your Honor, Justice Harlan that if the legislative committee had no other reason to call him, except for that coerced confession, there had been no other evidence to -- in anyway to justify as being called, as is the case here, I would say that he could -- that he would be immune from prosecution for refusing to answer those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.763" offset="2782438">Now, the -- the State of New York in its brief asserts at the Costello case authorizes a -- in that case, it was a deportation, an acquisition based upon evidence of -- although some of them evidenced was obtained through illegal wiretapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.804" offset="2874598">But the Costello case very carefully, the court very carefully says there that none of the District Attorney's questions, none not one, even applies that he had ever gained this information from the 1943 wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.215" offset="2932276">Costello was a known racketeer.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.289" offset="2944502">He had been indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.641" offset="2949935">The public records showed ample justification for his being questioned or being subject to the -- to the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.865" offset="2990791">Nothing there was -- nothing which was gained through wiretap was used against Costello nor was the proceeding against him based upon the wiretap.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.916" offset="3027048">Here, I repeat to -- but for the fact that the wire -- the electronic device has been planted.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.040" offset="3059545">There would have been no reason to call the petitioner to the legislative committee with this one exception from this -- the people bases its case that the -- he was a visitor in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.590" offset="3109700">He did go visit his brother and all visitors must sign a register; so that even if has there been no electronic eavesdropping, presumably, the records of the visiting would be available to the Parole Board and to the legislative committee and on the basis of that, they would have called him.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.935" offset="3191097">I submit Your Honors that that would not have constituted an adequate ground on the light of the -- of the tenor of cases of this Court to subpoena the defend -- the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.343" offset="3244701">All that happened was that a brother visits his brother in jail one time, a fraternal act which is explainable as a natural act of brotherly affection, brotherly friendliness.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.145" offset="3295901">No inference can arise from that effect which would justify, which justify subpoenaing this defendant -- this petitioner, before the legislative committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.644" offset="3345951">So that is -- we believe, we believe that the records establishes clearly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.592" offset="4817690">He said why, number one does not specifically refer to the -- to the eavesdropping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.138" offset="4835976">It doesn't make specific reference as the others do to the eavesdropping.</text>

            <text syncTime="1194.020" offset="4879444">He picked with number 19 first, showing that he was simply glancing through it and he basing upon a fact that on the face of it, it showed -- it was a broad general question and the question, the issue is whether the State of New York can immunize itself by sandwiching in a first and last question which on the face appeared to be general and unrelated make no specific reference to the -- to the particular eavesdropping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.322" offset="4980694">But nevertheless, nevertheless quite clearly grew out of that wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.755" offset="5002428">Again, I think the important thing to note is that but for the eavesdropping, but for the eavesdropping, it is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.649" offset="5033984">I think it's inescapable that the petitioner would never have been before that legislative committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.594" offset="5057703">I think that's the crux of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.822" offset="5070660">Now, the -- people makes the argument that at the time this was done, there was no law against the electronic eavesdropping in New York, true enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.266" offset="5136488">But this, I don't think, it's certainly not conclusive under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.048" offset="5151535">The purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment is to allow judicial review of conduct which is immoral even if it is not illegal under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.449" offset="5193122">If illegality was a sole test and obviously the state could immunize -- immunize itself, some of our passing the law, committing that which otherwise would be a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.241" offset="5236381">But I think it is extremely significant that no sooner did this event become public and become known that almost immediately, almost immediately a statute was enacted by the State of New York, making this conduct criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.011" offset="5299388">Criminal even if performed by a state official in the language which I haven't been able to find a precedent for, the finding -- persons to -- to include state officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1392.859" offset="5674820">In one of the cases, in one case it was an attorney-client relationship which was involved and that this is what was immoral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.188" offset="5700106">This is what was protested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.619" offset="5705853">But it's important to note, it's important to note that the penal law which made this criminal did not limit it to attorney-client relationships, did not say as it did in another case, one statute -- one provision says that anybody who bugs, this is the language which is used in the -- back in the -- in the trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.610" offset="5785788">Anybody who use it -- plants an electronic device in a jury room is guilty of a separate effects, but the other broad statute makes no reference to attorney and client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.107" offset="5835839">Any electronic eavesdropping is made a felony whether or not the persons are in a relationship of attorney and client, husband to wife, brother and brother or complete strangers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.191" offset="5880142">The offense is not based upon the relationship between the persons whose conversations was overheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.726" offset="5906265">The offense is based upon the immoral conduct on the part of the State and this is what shocked the people and this is what resulted in the statute being enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.452" offset="5949210">Now, there is a double offense here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.091" offset="5959764">This was offensive because in here there was in effect fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.131" offset="5979930">There was in effect a breach of a fiduciary relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.951" offset="5995186">The petitioner here was a -- in the true sense, a literal sense, he was a ward of the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="1483.021" offset="6035414">He could -- he could only go where the State of New York allowed him to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.910" offset="6050983">And the State of New York said, “Here, you can talk to your brother, to your wife and to your attorney over here, in this room here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.938" offset="6075120">I think that implicit but real was a representation there that you can talk in confidence there, that you can talk there in safety, we that supplied this place for you and we represent to you that it is safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.937" offset="6135097">Now, the court -- the State of New York said, “We're not going to let you talk to your brother or your attorney and your wife in private.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Jacob D. Fuchsberg</label>
            <text syncTime="1553.695" offset="6318164">May it please The Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.034" offset="6327463">I would like for a brief moment to go back to a question asked by Judge Brennan and Judge Harlan with respect to the divisibility of the various questions, and just point out the following to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.808" offset="6390575">I think aside from the argument that Mr. Pfeffer made to the effect that there was -- there seemed to be no justification except through a dragnet procedure for any inquiry of Harry Lanza and therefore the two questions that are sought to be separated from the other -- from the other 17 would not themselves be properly asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.088" offset="6479705">I think we also cannot take them and separate them unofficially because by the familiar principles of the doctrine of ejusdem generis, we must judge the intent of the first and 19th question, the two general questions in the light of the specific things asked in the other 17 which indicate that the first and 19th so-called omnibus questions of necessity must have had reference to and be motivated by the specific matter that's inquired into by the other 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.216" offset="6620244">Now you see, if Your Honors please, the order in which the questions were put to the witness are really of little significance for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.873" offset="6654830">They were put to Mr. Lanza on three different occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.054" offset="6667577">The 19 questions were put to him and the occasion of the first inquiry by the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.781" offset="6690461">And at that time, he was not offered immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.967" offset="6703208">Now, when he was recalled to the Committee, at that time, he was offered immunity and asked to answer all 19 questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.232" offset="6740302">So as a result, he knew by reason of the 17 questions to follow the first one, what the first one and the 19th one were leading to and therefore, to attempt to separate the first and 19th from all the other 17, when there isn't the slightest information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.403" offset="6804982">And I will go back to the testimony given by the counsel for the Committee in just a moment that these things can be broken asunder unless we would've take a patently artificial approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.140" offset="6847927">Now Mr. Bauman, the attorney for the Committee when he was called to testify and its very interesting to see while he does make the PAT statement that rather boldly, that the first and 19th questions were not necessarily based upon the eavesdropping through the electronic device.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.237" offset="6924309">It's interesting to note the language he uses which is quoted by us -- which is quoted at page 9 of the people of the State of New York's brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2183.128" offset="8835845">In order to constitute an invasion of -- of the privacy of the man's domain or here I -- I would say, it's -- it's more than his castle because here he -- he's a guest and -- and perhaps even a higher moral code of obligation attaches to a temporary abode which is provided for him specifically by someone else with all the protective moral safeguards that -- that's suppose to entail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.152" offset="8940022">But even if we require some kind of a thought, even it be not a technical trespass, in order to -- by -- in order to give rise to the application of the Fourth Amendment, I want to point out that there is inherent in the -- admitted facts in this case, the commission of at least one of several thoughts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.229" offset="9036257">For instance, there is -- in this particular case, the element of fraud, there is certainly at least an implied representation that this man could engage in this conference safely and with privately in the precinct of this particular conference room and a -- a violation of that promise is certainly tortuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.300" offset="9132596">At least, it certainly would come under the general character of an action on the case on -- on the common law -- in our common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.344" offset="9172720">In addition, I would say that -- since the people here have argued that Mr. Lanza was there in effect by sufferance, that's what they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.416" offset="9213053">There are all kinds of regulations in the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.307" offset="9220577">There's no indication that he knew about them and that therefore his right to privacy in this conversation was not inviolable and it almost shocks me to have read that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.280" offset="9268537">Nevertheless, I think even in common law where a person is a bare licensee, even there, there is a safeguard against entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.300" offset="9320573">In other words, you cannot set a trap for a person even if he is not a business visitor or partakes of some of the highest standards of care that are old -- in the law of tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.829" offset="9366653">And in this particular case by -- ever since we have the setting of a snare and a trap specifically, obviously, no matter what his relationship was in this particular room, there was to him a standard of care that was obviously violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.861" offset="9434781">So that if we need in our case, in order to give rise very forcefully to their protective guard of the Fourth Amendment, we have here plenty of the atmosphere and the fact with regard to the -- to the performance of a tortuous act and the use of that in order to extort from him through the use of perhaps an invisible but not imaginary means of invading or seizing from him the private contents of his conversations with his brother in this particular prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.443" offset="9597158">Now, the people have argued in their brief that the universal condemnation and they're willing to rest with that kind of slap on the wrist which would be of a little help to Mr. Lanza that the universal condemnation of the conduct of that branch of the State of New York that engaged in this eavesdropping, they say that that condemnation really attached only to the invasion of the attorney-client privilege, to the extent that one of the conversations tapped was one not only with Mr. Harry Lanza who is the brother of the -- of the prisoner but also with his attorney as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.232" offset="9768312">And I would like to point out to this Court that in this very case involving the brother and not the attorney, the Appellate Division of the State of New York specifically referred to the conduct here and I quote this from their opinion, “That the conduct here was reprehensible and defensive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.306" offset="9844590">The Court at that time though when it handed down its opinion in the Appellate Division, felt that it was restrained by the law as if then conceived it to be prior to the decision in the Mapp case to permit the evidence which was the fruit of this illegal inquiry into evidence no matter how rep -- reprehensive and offensive they considered it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.011" offset="11279444">But I should like to concentrate first on the nature of the proceeding which this petitioner faced before the Joint Legislative Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.924" offset="11311104">I think it is clear from the decisions of this Court that there is a vast difference between the panoply of constitutional rights enjoined by man accused of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.860" offset="11350810">And those enjoined by a witness who appears before a duly constituted and authorized committee of a legislative body which is seeking to find facts and exercising that vital and inherent function of investigation which this Court has recognized to be an important adjunct to the legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.720" offset="11434297">Under those circumstances, and I submit that it is because of the fact that no personal or property rights are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.374" offset="11464913">The witness before the Committee has very limited rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.125" offset="11479855">Now, in -- the recent case of Hannah against Larche handed down by this Court, I believe that the principal was -- was well stated and exactly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.796" offset="11522591">Furthermore, the Court has expressed considerable reluctance to interfere with the legislative process in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.034" offset="11559476">The only cases which I've been able to discover, have been cases from the Circuit Court of Appeals which are cited in our brief, in which it is clearly stated that if there be an abuse by a legislative investigation and if there be a threatened denial of a constitutional right by this investigated methods, the remedy is with the people and with the legislature itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.036" offset="11643486">I submit that this is wise so there's no reason to assume that a legislature is any less concerned with the rights of -- of its individual citizens, then as a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.293" offset="11680580">And in this very instance as has been pointed out by my adversary, the legislature of New York has acted and has passed an eavesdropping statute which clearly covers any -- any constitutional denial by any person in the course of the conducting of an investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3630.097" offset="14623744">Well, it came about in this way sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.542" offset="14633566">The first was a conversation between the prisoner and his wife Ellen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.260" offset="14652374">During the course of that conversation which was very general in nature, he -- she indicated to him that his attorney, Sylvester Cosentino was there and they had driven up together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.675" offset="14698036">During the course of the conversation toward the end of it, the attorney, Mr. Cosentino apparently walked into the visitor's room because there is a hello, by Joseph Lanza and then from thereon, his voice participating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.178" offset="14748087">However, there is indication in the conversation of all that he expected to converse in private with the prisoner shortly in another place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.390" offset="14792913">This is the only indication we have had in the records so far the existence of this lawyer's room but apparently not contested that there was such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.805" offset="14822588">So that there was for a while a three-way conversation on the tape between the prisoner, Joseph Lanza, not the petitioner, his wife, Ellen and Cosentino.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.499" offset="14861354">At the end of that conversation, the wife walks out and the attorney is in the business room with the prisoner for approximately six exchanges that take place between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.917" offset="14903045">Let's say about six things when suddenly interrupted the door is open, there's another voice and they both leave apparently to continue their conference in the lawyer's room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.175" offset="14940035">Now, that conversation, that entire conversation is in no way involved in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.867" offset="14962813">Now, I wish to emphasize that, if there was in that brief exchange and interference with an attorney's privilege, it is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.618" offset="15001893">But it is perfectly clear, from the testimony of the committee counsel below, that insofar as any of the questions put to Harry Lanza were based upon the intercepted conversations, they were only based upon interceptive conversations between Harry and Joseph, and they were not based upon intercepted conversations between the prisoner and his wife, which perhaps enjoys greater legal protection than the relationship between brothers and certainly not between the attorney and the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.323" offset="15128639">As a matter of fact, there was an independent case in New York that arose out of attempt to hold the attorney in contempt for refusing to answer questions before another state investigative body predicated upon that brief exchange that he had with his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.882" offset="15190915">And the courts of New York declined to do so primarily on the ground that even though the questions did not themselves constitute a breach of the attorney-client relationship nor would the answers have constituted such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.260" offset="15244413">They did flow from this interception and the -- and therefore, the attorney could not be compelled to answer them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.447" offset="15273148">But in any event, that was a completely independent matter as far as the present case is concerned but as the tapes here involved and the only tape involved here was the conversation between the brothers, Harry and Joseph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.662" offset="15322049">And it's perfectly clear from the questions themselves which paraphrase matters which appeared upon the tapes that they were referring only to that portion of the interception which were occurred between the two brothers and that the interference if any, with the attorney-client relationship was in no way involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="4350.003" offset="17503378">And certainly, the if -- their investigation were undertaken into the manner in which Joseph Lanza had obtained his release on parole is quite normal that those in his family and those who visited him and those who were connected with his interest should be called in as witnesses to supply what information they may have to the investigating body.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.792" offset="17586552">This apparently is what was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.124" offset="17595852">And I think that it's quite clear from the testimony of the trial from Mr. Bauman, brief as it is that he was making every effort, every possible conscientious effort at that time to be perfectly fair in his responses as to the derivation of the matters which went to the formula -- into the questions he formulated as committee counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.034" offset="17675473">Now, I think that it would be seen for example from his request -- the question as to the third account in the indictment that he said, “Well, I want to be perfectly fair with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.884" offset="17710895">I think that it might have been based in part upon the transcript as well as upon other information which we had.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.838" offset="17734719">Now, there was no such equivocal answer with respect to either the first or last count of this information.</text>

            <text syncTime="4469.460" offset="17981210">Now this is certainly the type of question which one would expect completely independent of any transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.504" offset="18001377">There's nothing in the transcripts themselves that -- that was utilized in the formulation of the question as there was in the other 17 questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4505.407" offset="18124988">In response to this, counsel apparently urges that they were so intertwined that -- of necessity one contributed to the other and in fact he would have never been called as a witness at all if not had been for the transcripts.</text>

            <text syncTime="5028.790" offset="20218546">Consequently, it's not surprising that independent agencies of -- of the Government, of the State should institute their own investigatory procedures, one of which was apparently to overhear these conversations, both the one here in issue and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.086" offset="20287718">Now, I alluded earlier to the fact that New York has passed a law which has made this a felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="5211.697" offset="20950183">Nothing could be further from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.821" offset="20958647">It was conducted for information only.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.725" offset="20970245">It was used not to convict Lanza of a misdemeanor or to convict anybody else of any crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.110" offset="20991770">It was used merely in order to facilitate the information gathering functions of a valid legislative committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.993" offset="21023326">There has been no contest here as to the subsequent trial at which the petitioner here was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5237.578" offset="21053733">There's been no allegation that that trial in any way failed to comport with constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.298" offset="21076616">Consequently to assert that this was an act which was committed by the State in order to convict the petitioner of a misdemeanor is a gross distortion of the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.086" offset="21255711">In conclusion, I think that our -- the points made in our -- in our brief are tracing this issue point-by-point from the severabililty of the questions to the constitutional right or a jeopardy in -- inherent in the proceedings before the legislature ultimately back to what occurred in that prison visitors' room will demonstrate that there was at no time during the course of this investigation any action by the State which in anyway trampled the constitutional rights of the petitioner in this case and on that we rest.</text>

            <text syncTime="5336.834" offset="21450689">The question was asked whether the trap -- the bugging was specifically for Lanza, was simply the whole room was bugged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.477" offset="21489246">The New York State Legislature, New York Joint Legislative Committee on Privacy of Communications in report on this case, stated as follows, "As the request of Parole Board Officers” “bugging trap" was set for Lanza and his family" New York State has admitted that this was a trap set exclusively for Lanza at a hearing -- at a report by the New York State Legislature itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="5383.925" offset="21639084">Second on the question, I think it was Mr. Justice Clark raised the point about publicity, was an act of publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.729" offset="21678268">And Uviller says, yes there was publicity and they may have gotten the information from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.853" offset="21694777">Well, there was publicity but none of the publicity ever mentioned the petitioner until he was called before the legislative committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.449" offset="21721213">Now, the first time his name appeared in the press not until he was called before the legislative committee on the basis of this tap -- this tap.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.886" offset="21750888">Question was asked on the Costello case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.810" offset="21766562">Mr. Uviller doesn't remember that -- what the -- the evidence in the Costello case other than the wiretap.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.442" offset="21789132">The opinion state specifically that Costello had been invited and the -- and the -- the testimony in the indictment was one of the factors in the case completely independent of the wiretapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.873" offset="21838869">Besides other things, public records -- the -- the court first of public records which was told and testified to but a prior indictments so that -- and says completely that none of Mr. Hogan's questions even apply to the -- even gained that he ever gained his information from the 1943 wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.466" offset="21905220">Now, on the independence of the -- of the legislature and the coordinate facts of legislature, that has belittled that there might considerably be a greater reluctance on the part of court with the fear with the legislative conduct because of the coordinative branch.</text>

            <text syncTime="5491.455" offset="22069164">If that never called -- occurred that they were still calling then they might have called him but not asking anything which came out of the bugging.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.660" offset="22094033">Here, there's a double rule, calling out the questioning exclusively which came out of the bugging.</text>

            <text syncTime="5501.861" offset="22110856">Well now the Chief Justice asked Mr. Uviller whether he'd make -- whether there was -- a distinction could be drawn if this had been a grand jury inquiry, would you draw that distinction?</text>

            <text syncTime="5510.728" offset="22146278">I want to go into that because I think the -- the -- the people must reveal, have kind of conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.557" offset="22165608">They conceded the point I'm just making that the constitution does not protect only against judicial interventions with privacy or with rights that the legislature too is subject to the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.445" offset="22221197">Certainly in the case of a state legislature, the argument the coordinative branch made very well have some validity where this Court is called upon to pass judgement of what a committee of the Congress of coordinate branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.889" offset="22266964">But we're asking you to pass judgment upon the State and the Fourteenth Amendment used the word state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.965" offset="22287235">I don't need to -- to spell out the many decisions which indicate that -- that means every branch of the state is equally subject to the Fourteenth Amendment and to its obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.347" offset="22324746">Now Mr. Uviller has admitted, he said and asked the question that, if this had been an aggravated violation of decency and morality, that important, like the result -- as to Mr. Justice Black's question, if there had been torture or it has been -- the one that the other Justice asked it, had been broken in without -- without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.994" offset="22411368">That even there that there -- even the legislature could not use.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.975" offset="22427251">The question then is, in what category are to we view this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.701" offset="22450134">I think the answer to that is that people of the State of New York can answer to themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5591.366" offset="22468838">They have passed immediately, spontaneously a law saying, “This is a horrible conduct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.478" offset="22493288">There is no felony in New York, making it a felony, maybe a misdemeanor -- maybe something, a civil wrong, making the felony for a police officer to break in without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.091" offset="22531741">But it is a felony for that same police officer to bug -- to bug a -- a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="5612.887" offset="22554937">The people of the State of New York have indicated how serious they consider this breach of decency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.666" offset="22578030">They have passed judgement on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.312" offset="22584613">All we're asking is at this point give sanction to this judgement.</text>
