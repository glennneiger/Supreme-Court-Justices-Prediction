            <text syncTime="27.635" offset="213870">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.698" offset="234141">This case presents a question that is here for the first time that is whether a longshoreman who was injured on a conceitedly unseaworthy vessel whether he may have his rights against the ship owner and his security against the vessel vitiated by the facts that the owner of the vessel demised it to his stevedore employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.584" offset="345736">May I say that this question although raised by the respondent in the District Court does not really arise in this case until the Circuit Court's opinion because the District Court found as a matter of fact that there was no demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.206" offset="432149">And we contend that the Circuit Court of Appeals has violated the injunction of this Court in the McAllister case by reversing the District Court on evidence that was not clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.369" offset="496828">I think perhaps it'd be best to state the respondent's argument in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.135" offset="523891">The respondent's argument it was, the owner has no personal liability because he has demised his vessel to someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.123" offset="579897">And despite the injunctions of Sieracki and all the cases of this Court that followed Sieracki that an owner has a non-delegable duty to provide and maintain at all times a seaworthy vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.749" offset="638412">A demise makes the demisee pro hac vice the owner and therefore the owner's interest is cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.449" offset="669132">Therefore he has no in personam liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.234" offset="684283">And the demisee who happens to be covered by a system of working with compensation cannot be liable because he's been exonerated by workmen's compensation and therefore this longshoreman who was injured exactly the same way that Sieracki was on an unseaworthy vessel in navigation is just tough luck.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.813" offset="778637">He doesn't have any right.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.423" offset="2601044">And in that case, a demise was constituted by parole but an in rem liability was placed against the vessel anyhow for a breach of a contract of freight.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.893" offset="4266924">And therefore this man has his remedy and has leaned under the Grillea -- under the Sieracki case and as between the rights of the United States and Moore-McCormack, there was in that case an indemnity agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.983" offset="4331290">But there need not be because in the Barnstable which this Court decided many year ago was also a written demised charter where the demisee was operating the vessel and was in collision with another vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.267" offset="4400462">There was never any question that the injured victim, the vessel that was -- was sunk or damaged as a result of this collision could collect in rem against the Barnstable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.807" offset="4634624">There are, I might point out, many situations where a shipowner may have someone else operate a vessel for on behalf or with him for various purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.540" offset="4713514">A Circuit Court recently decided the Mission San Francisco cases which involved the United States MSTS contracts with masters and tankers where they would jointly held liable to anyone involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.843" offset="4770774">Then there've been cases where the identity of the employer was so confused on the part of the employer as -- so that you could not differentiate whether A, B or C was the actual employer of a particular seaman.</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.378" offset="4848933">So that, we feel that on this basis of that -- there was a demise even assuming that the testimony of a stevedore employer was credible that the Circuit Court erred and the case must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.545" offset="4945586">The next question that arises is whether assuming a demise, there was in personam liability on the part of the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.738" offset="4998353">Now, here this is a conflict between the First and the Second Circuits too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.187" offset="5020087">The First Circuit had the Vitozi case prior to the Southern District of New York had it in the rem action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.884" offset="5050911">That was Vitozi against Balboa Steamship Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.075" offset="5067630">And the First Circuit decided that since the owner had demised the vessel, he was the -- the demisee was pro hac vice the owner and there was no in personam liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.869" offset="5130846">Two years later, the same fact situation came up in New York in Cannella against Lykes Brothers Steamship Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.716" offset="5166268">And again, Mr. -- Judge Hand, for the Second Circuit said, "No, the shipowner is liable because there is a non-delegable duty upon the shipowner at all time."</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.777" offset="5226454">And in this case, in its opinion, in the case here before this Court, the First Circuit admits it may have been wrong, but only as to an unseaworthy conditions that preceded the demise not one that supervened the demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.206" offset="5320182">Mr. -- in the Cannella case, Judge Hand says that he saw no difference even though in that case was unquestionably preceding the demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.440" offset="5361142">But again, there's this conflict where -- which where the First Circuit stand and in some boats again on the Vitozi case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.940" offset="5403146">I would say that there is no reason if this Court is going to continue the humanitarian policy of Sieracki to say that there is no in personam liability on the part of the shipowner because he has demised the vessel.</text>
