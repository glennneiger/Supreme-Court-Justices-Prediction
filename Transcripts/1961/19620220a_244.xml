            <text syncTime="106.931" offset="531101">That still does not take it outside the purview of a cause of acton for the chancellor alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.433" offset="561089">Similarly, in a suit by one in possession of real property to acquire a title or to remove a cloud on the title, the court of equity may determine the legal title.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.816" offset="2518601">Now, it seems self-evident in this case that Mr. Ooms, with an awareness of the fact that his demand in the complaint for the balance due under the written contract creates a legal course of action is attempting to obscure that.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.972" offset="2607208">But, I think, Your Honors will find that the complaint in itself says that rather specifically and Judge Wood below understood it quite clearly because in his opinion, which is at page 36 of the record, he said in clear language, “Incidental to this relief, the complaint also demands the $60,000, now allegedly do and owing plaintiffs under the aforesaid contract”.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.869" offset="2738866">And we took his phrase of “incidental to this relief” to mean that he was giving it a subordinate position that the dominate phase of the case in his opinion was equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.871" offset="2806888">And we submit that this is where Judge Wood erred in not accepting the teachings of Beacon that regardless of what evaluation, the two courses of action should be given, if there was present illegal course of action which he recognized, this defendant was entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.845" offset="2898735">Now, I'd like to conclude with just two short paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.202" offset="2916185">It seems to me that in Beacon, where you had two separate courses of action, one equitable, one legal, and this Court denied the right of the -- of the court below to postpone the trial of the legal course of action as a deprivation of the rights under the Seventh Amendment and in Thermo-Stitch, which followed that in the Fifth Circuit where you had two independent courses of action, one legal and one equitable, in which the same result was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.144" offset="3087966">We come to our case which seems to be even more compelling because in this case, it seems to me we have a legal course of action and an equitable which are dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.140" offset="3139897">It seems to me that there can be no equitable relief in this case until this plaintiff has established the legal course of action because this case being heard by a jury would first determine whether there was a breach of the contract, whether any sums were due under the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.341" offset="3264763">Because, if -- if the question is raised on the pleadings, then the plaintiff in the suit doesn't have to establish existence of a contract.</text>
