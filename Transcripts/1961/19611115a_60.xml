            <label>Mr. Francis N. Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="12.956" offset="155146">-- and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.349" offset="164760">This case involves the interpretation of Section 112 (c) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the so-called “boot” provision limiting recognition of taxable gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.363" offset="224841">And also, by a parallel interpretation, it involves the interpretation of Section 112 (e) of that same Code which precludes recognition of tax losses in boot situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.223" offset="288266">These are the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.761" offset="298402">The taxpayer, Turnbow owned all the stock comprising 5,000 shares of non-voting common stock of International Dairy Supply Company, a Nevada Corporation engaged in the business of dehydrating milk, shipping it abroad, reconstituting it as fluid milk, chocolate milk, and the like and supplying it in foreign countries to the United States Armed Forces in those countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.809" offset="414595">Foremost Dairy Company, a New York Corporation was engaged in distributing milk and dairy products in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.818" offset="454614">These parties entered in the negotiations culminating in a so-called a mandatory agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.646" offset="485961">Under these terms, Turnbow exchanged or transferred all of the voting stock of supply to Foremost in exchange for 82,375 shares of the voting stocks of Foremost plus $3 million cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.917" offset="575091">Supply was then to continue in business as an operating subsidiary of Foremost.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.713" offset="606229">It was not to make any distribution to shareholders either under the plan or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.947" offset="635173">There were other provisions that made extensive changes in the management of the two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.079" offset="659728">The number of directors of supply was to be changed to six, so that Turnbow could maintain three directors, and Foremost could elect three directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.824" offset="702673">An executive committee of three was created, two of them to be nominated by Foremost.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.261" offset="728377">Turnbow was to be President and General Manager of Supply, while the President of Foremost was to be Vice-President of Supply and Chairman of its executive committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.830" offset="774666">Turnbow was the -- a Director of Foremost and to have the right to nominate to other directors of Foremost.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.402" offset="800998">Turnbow was to be Chairman of Foremost's Executive Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.797" offset="818552">Foremost's business was to be divided into two divisions, an Eastern Division and a Western and International Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.482" offset="857318">The President of Foremost was to be General Manager of the Eastern Division and Turnbow was to be General Manager of the Western and International Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.521" offset="901413">The terms of this mandatory agreement were carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.585" offset="917713">Now, the mere recital of these facts demonstrates several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.397" offset="936939">First, there was a very real business purpose in the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.270" offset="956479">There was a real reorganization of both companies in the corporate sense although not in the Revenue Code definitional sense as I shall come to in a moment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="223.117" stopTime="229.509">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="223.117" offset="995871">Do you concede that that is so, that there is no reorganization in the Internal Revenue sense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="francis_n_marshall" startTime="229.509" stopTime="699.150">
            <label>Mr. Francis N. Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="229.509" offset="1021367">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.951" offset="1023143">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.707" offset="1026173">It does not meet the definition of the reorganization in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.022" offset="1047489">No party has ever so contended and no court in the case has ever so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.775" offset="1074448">Secondly, these facts demonstrate that there was full continuity of the business enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.640" offset="1105899">And third, Turnbow continued to have a very substantial equity interest or state in that enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.850" offset="1138813">Turnbow, for the taxable year in question, reported the amount of cash received, $3 million plus the expenses of the transaction as capital gain and he paid his tax thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.015" offset="1195447">The Commissioner determined that the capital gain to be recognized for tax purposes was the sum of the cash plus the expenses, plus the difference between the value of the Foremost stock at the time of the exchange and Turnbow's cost of the supply stock which he transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.216" offset="1272247">Turnbow petitioned at the Tax Court for redetermination.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.615" offset="1285831">The Tax Court held that the recognized gain was limited to the cash boot under Section 112 (c) (1) declaring that no reason appeared for departing from its long established interpretation of that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.271" offset="1348420">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed holding for the Commissioner and this Court granted certiorari in view of the conflict of decisions with that of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Howard versus the Commissioner of Internal Revenue decided in 1956 which accorded with the decision of the Tax Court in the case Bonham.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.733" offset="1434311">Section 112 (c) (1), fits into an easily-understood tax patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.603" offset="1461791">Generally, gains and losses from sales or exchanges are recognized, that is made subject to appropriate tax treatment, at the time of the transaction under Section 112 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and its predecessors and successors, but the Congress made exceptions in the subsection immediately following, certain exchanges solely in kind to use the statutory phrase wherein inappropriate for immediate tax effect, that is the gains and losses therefore were not recognized as provided in Section 112 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="382.766" offset="1634408">But this did not mean of course that the exchanges were tax free or that the participants escaped taxation, the tax effects were merely postponed until the taxpayer made a more radical change of his property ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.843" offset="1690728">Until then, he merely held a paper profit or a paper loss, the same as though he continued to hold his former property either appreciated in value or depreciated in value as the case might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.231" offset="1748302">The next three subsections of Section 112 dealt with exchanges not solely in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.957" offset="1779231">That is those which would be “solely” in kind types of exchanges, if it were not for the fact that money or other property that is other than the kinds described in Section 112 (b) and commonly called boot were also received.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.353" offset="1860733">Section 112 (c) (1) provided that gain in such a transaction should be recognized but not in excess of the amount of the boot.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.475" offset="1901275">At the same time, Section 112 (e) provided that loss in such a transaction should not be recognized for the obvious and expressed reason that otherwise, it would be too easy simply by adding a dollar to an exchange or superficial exchange that is one which left the taxpayer for all practical purposes still holding the same investment in the enterprise, to transform paper loss into a tax loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.725" offset="2014229">Parenthetically, I might say here that this couldn't work in the opposite direction under Section 112 (c) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="484.726" offset="2042232">Since -- if money or other boot has added, any gain would always be immediately taxed to the full extent of the added boot.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.073" offset="2075669">The controversy here is between what appears to be the natural and literal reading of Section 112 (c) (1), one which the Tax Court has applied and declared for many years, and which is in the fullest harmony with the legislative policies in the pattern of the tax law on one end, and a strained and unnatural reading implicated by the Commissioner which is out of step for these things, and in particular opens up a large “loophole” for the taking of paper losses as tax losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.048" offset="2207535">In short, in this case, the Commissioner seems to be beating of the little fire or reflection of a fire in front of him, or he's starting a large fire in his rear.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.784" offset="2246510">The words of the statute, Section 112 (c) (1) are simple enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.265" offset="2268453">As applicable to this case, it says, if an exchange would be within the provisions of subsection (b) (3) as it relates to this exchange, now these subsections are mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.321" offset="2320697">If it were not for the fact that, the property received in exchange consist not only of property permitted by such paragraph to be received without recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then the gains of the recipient shall be recognized within an amount not in excess of such money.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.458" offset="2401155">And subsection (e), uses parallel, identical language, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.082" offset="2431666">It says, “If an exchange would be within the provisions of subsections (b) (1) through (5), and here (b) (3), or with -- of this Section, if it were not for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by such paragraph to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also other property or money, then no loss from the exchange shall be recognized.”</text>
            <text syncTime="607.076" offset="2531662">Now this language directs us to Section 112 (b) (3) which says, “No gain or loss shall be recognized if stock or securities in a corporation, a party to a reorganization are, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization exchanged solely for a stock or securities in such corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="634.220" offset="2640227">And reorganization is applicable here on this “would-be-within” basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.826" offset="2666663">It's defined in Section 112 (g) (1) (B) and again using “solely”.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.527" offset="2689442">And Section 112 (g) (1) (B) starts as follows, the term “reorganization” means (a) a statutory merger or consolidation, (b) the acquisition by one corporation in exchange solely for all or a part of its voting stock of at least 80% of the voting stock and at least 80% among the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation, or (c) the acquisition by one corporation in exchange solely for all of its voting stock and essentially all the properties of another corporation, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.554" offset="2833638">And by the way, this lettering scheme (a), (b) and (c) has given rise to the practice of referring to various transactions as, (A) type of reorganizations, (B) type of reorganizations, (C) type reorganizations, and so forth, which will be a convenience in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="717.314" offset="2972609">If Turnbow had not received any cash, the exchange would have been solely for stock or securities as specified in Section 112 (b) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="729.123" offset="3019839">At least 80%, in fact, 100% of the stock of supply would have or was transferred and solely voting stock of Foremost would have been received.</text>

            <text syncTime="906.290" offset="3728488">The Commissioner himself readily agrees that the “if not” language of Section 112 (c) (1) removes the effect “solely” or perhaps it's more accurate to say, hypothetically restores the “solely” as the word is expressed in (b) (3), but then he says, he can not retain this effect and hypothetically restore the “solely” imported into (b) (3) in the reference to reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.844" offset="3842800">In other words, where (b) (3) has three requirements, solely for stock or securities, in a party or reorganization which in this case means -- in this context would mean solely for voting stock and a plan of reorganization which in this context again would mean solely for voting stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.798" offset="3922526">The Commissioner freely admits that the “if not” hypothesis operates to restore the “solely” in the first one, but then he says, it denies that it restores the “solely” which is repeated in the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.149" offset="3975920">But still, I say, we were faced with the fact that if it were not for the cash, if no cash were received, then all the “solely's” are satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.695" offset="4018134">The Commissioner arrives at this position by a curiously inverted reasoning and it's all more strange because in trying to cage this mouse, he's letting all the animals escape under Section (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="993.653" offset="4078007">The point he is trying to reach is the transactions which “would-be” (B) type or (C) type reorganizations but for cash added can never come under Section 112 (c) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.910" offset="4127013">And this is the way he goes about it, he said -- he says, let's first lay to one side all these -- if it “would-be” if not hypothetical business and see what we have in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.076" offset="4187721">There was cash boot received hence, there was no reorganization, hence, there was no property permitted to be received without recognition of gain, hence, (c) (1) can apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.046" offset="4243519">But this reasoning doesn't stand the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.396" offset="4256998">For example, consider a statutory merger, an (A) type reorganization which often includes cash as part of the consideration along with stock, the Commissioner concedes that such a transaction comes within -- comes in for a limited recognition of gain under Section 112 (c) (1), that is if the stockholder taxpayer would be a subject to recognition of gain but only to the extent of the cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.102" offset="4363786">But suppose we now apply his reasoning to that situation as he applies it in this case, and by the way, this is a course of reasoning that appears to have been developed for the first time in the brief filed in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.890" offset="4414882">He compartmentalizes the two categories of property mentioned in (c) (1) without regard for each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.706" offset="4450200">That is first, property to be permitted to be received -- a property permitted by Section (b) (3) to be received without recognition of gain, and second, cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.297" offset="4500564">Then he says, without excluding the cash, see if there is property permitted by (b) (3) to be received without recognition of gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.850" offset="4538807">Now in our merger situation -- in a merger situation I'm just postulating, there is stock plus cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.302" offset="4572557">So to find out if there is property permitted by (b) (3) to be received without recognition of gain, we turn to (b) (3) and that says, “If stock or securities are exchanged solely for stock or securities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.330" offset="4632743">So looking squarely at the cash, we cannot find that stock or securities are exchanged solely for the stock or securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.785" offset="4662523">So the first compartment or category in Section (c) (1) will never be filled and (c) (1) can never be fulfilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.057" offset="4695646">Logically, the Commissioner's step-by-step reasoning was compartmentalization and it operates equally at all as always.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.996" offset="4731382">This shows to me that this compartmentation method is all wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.904" offset="4754996">The two categories do have regard for each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.260" offset="4768371">The cash doesn't jump out of the exchange to get rid of part to the effect of “solely” and then jump right in -- and jump right back in again so as to bring “solely” back to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.273" offset="4816436">This illustrates to our way of thinking artificial and self-contradictory nature of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.053" offset="4847574">Of course, in fact, “solely” doesn't appear in (c) (1) and neither does “reorganization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.617" offset="4869831">The actual status inherent in those words is not part of (c) (1) which hypothesizes a contrary status by the “if not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.183" offset="4916120">All along, Congress has made it clear that as to a stock for stock exchange, or a merger, or substantially all the corporate assets for stock, or recapitalization, when the business enterprise is continued and when to the extent that the investors' interest in the enterprise is continued, in other words, Foremost property loss is rather a paper profit or loss in the continuing business enterprise than a real property loss in the terminal transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.841" offset="5046732">Then, in order not to hamper legitimate business adjustments, Congress is satisfied to defer present tax effects and require a tax accounting later when the taxpayer has made some sort of a terminal transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.695" offset="5098141">But, when cash or other property outside the continuing enterprises added to the consideration, Congress will immediately tax any gain to the extent of the boot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.659" offset="5142026">But not to any greater extent lest it (Inaudible) the policy stated just before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.929" offset="5167104">The laws of the legislative policies and the congressional pattern, a longstanding and clearly understood by the Congress, and they are fully satisfied in this case by taxing Turnbow on his gain to the full extent of the cash received as has been done in deferring the tax as to a stock interest in the enterprise until he has made some final disposition of it as the Tax Court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.411" offset="5273057">When Congress has made it clear that when a shareholder exchanges his voting stock in one corporation or voting stock in another and there are in fact an honest business purpose, a continuation of the business enterprise and a continuing substantial interest of the shareholder in that enterprise, the time is not then appropriate for a tax accounting, the tax reckoning on the stock received in the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.626" offset="5389876">And when as I say Congress has made that clear, then it is difficult to see how that time is anymore appropriate as to the stock simply because the shareholder has received a dollar in addition and pays his tax on the dollar immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.153" offset="5451943">That is what Section 112 (c) (1) takes care of and that is the case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.622" offset="5513906">I believe so Mr. Justice Harlan, because in the Howard case for example, the Commissioner was apparently urging that Section 112 (c) (1) apply, so as to tax -- to lay a tax on the amount of cash and a promise to pay preferred stock in that case, and the Commissioner was on the other side of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.904" offset="5591019">Now that case turned also upon the question of whether the transactions preferred by stockholders exchange their stock, should all be taken together or whether they were separable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.889" offset="5638980">Nevertheless, the Commissioner was apparently advocating the application of (c) (1) in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.100" offset="5663744">More than that, however, the fact is so important that the Tax Court ever since 1934, the Tax Court of 16 expert tax judges has been applying this interpretation as natural interpretation of Section 112 (c) (1) and is applied originally in the Bruce case, and the Bonham case, and the Love case, that's all going on without change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.402" offset="5752978">The taxpayer -- the Tax Court would never have any division of opinion and never deviated from that method of interpretation which is simply as the taxpayer says in this case, eliminate the cash and then see what you have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.257" offset="6284413">It is the very idea -- it would be -- if not -- if it were not for the fact that implies a contrary to facts, so we don't look at the actual effect, we look at the situation as it would be if you've eliminated the cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.899" offset="6342928">And that has been the whole pattern ever since these provisions were put in the law back in 1924 and 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.490" offset="6377305">Now, may I -- may I just add to that this very fact, if it weren't for the fact that cash was received, then again, we get to the situation where all the requirements including reorganization, including solely for voting stock are met.</text>

            <text syncTime="1588.127" offset="6455881">So, you have your basic pattern and then when you have your cash added, the Congress simply says, well, “We aren't going to -- we aren't going to let the taxpayers escape taxation on any gain to the extent of the boot, but we're still going to defer his tax to the extent of the stock in this bona fide business readjustments until he makes some more terminal disposition of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.952" offset="6567163">It still gets back to the undoubted fact that without the cash, all of the requirements of these three are met.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.035" offset="6615542">It would then be a reorganization, it would be within the terms of Section 112 (b) (3), and it is not simply because there is cash added but as to the cash, the taxpayer has been taxed, he's paid his tax and that part of it is closed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.780" offset="6838523">Just through, in the Bonham case decided in 1936, under the Revenue Act of 1928, there is a reference and statement of the question, assuming the absence of the cash before going to the reorganization definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.736" offset="6906337">But the reorganization definition under the 1928 Act did not contain the solely for voting stock requirement and I hope to show that's the very reason that requirement is added was to prevent qualification of this very kind of transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.639" offset="7169964">It doesn't prescribe the consequences, the consequences that qualify as reorganization are specified elsewhere and they are two in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.318" offset="7208626">The primary one is that described by Section 112 (b) (3) and (c) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.591" offset="7233703">That is, if there is reorganization, then exchanges in pursuant of the -- pursuance of the plan of reorganization are tax-free except to the extent of boot, i.e. the gains or losses not recognized except for any boot received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.653" offset="7313951">I might note that the result that the petitioners contend for here is precisely the result that would obtain if it were reorganizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.842" offset="7350732">So this argument means that not being a reorganization has no effect upon the recognition for gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.475" offset="7381243">The other consequences of being a reorganization is that prescribed in the basis provisions, the provisions governing the basis of property for purposes of depreciation and determining gain or loss on subsequent sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.626" offset="7441847">Section 113 (a) (7) provides that if a corporation acquires property, here that would be the Foremost Corporation, the acquiring corporation, acquires property in a reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.463" offset="7497226">It does not get a new cost basis for the property unless it rather takeover the basis that the property had in the hands of the transferor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.471" offset="7541217">Now, those are the only two consequences for reorganizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.574" offset="7553651">They are specified in the 1939 Code, that is nonrecognition of gain to the transferor and carryover the basis to the transferee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.262" offset="7596387">Now, from those consequences, I think the basic notion of what a reorganization is becomes clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.913" offset="7623032">The definition simply describe transactions on which Congress has deemed there is not a sufficient change in the nature of the underlying property and the interest in it to justify a reckoning up of gain or loss to the transferor or the creation of the new basis to the transferee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.553" offset="7697533">The enterprise ought to continue on and the tax status quo should be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.531" offset="7725537">But what that means is that the definition of a reorganization has as its very purpose the specification of the kinds of transactions in which the exchanges would be subject to the nonrecognition provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.451" offset="7793142">That's its only purpose in as much as the basis carryover is really a corollary to the nonrecognition of gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.333" offset="7832743">Now, in this case, as I say, the word “reorganization,” the gain would be taxable only to the extent of the cash which is the result to which the petitioner contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.920" offset="7875062">But it's admitted that there is not a reorganization in this case because he failed to satisfy the solely for voting stock requirement in the definition of a reorganization, the “would-be” definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.298" offset="7924590">But he says, it makes no difference, the result is the same as though that requirement were not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.991" offset="7951339">Now I think a complete answer is that his argument destroys any purpose to solely for voting stock requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.024" offset="7987493">It has no consonance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.565" offset="7993657">Now, I shouldn't say that it destroys it because his argument, under his argument, while the failure to satisfy the solely for voting stock requirement doesn't have any effect upon his recognition of gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.416" offset="8057083">It does control the basis consequence to the transferee in this case, because there was in fact, no reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.655" offset="8098043">The basis carryover provisions does not apply and Foremost gets instead of the petitioner's low basis for the supply stock that it had, a stepped-up fair market value basis of the stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.720" offset="8222281">The most -- a large number of the reorganization cases, Helvering v. Southwest Consolidated as a matter of fact is a basis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.981" offset="8259271">And it goes on the question whether or not it is a reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.879" offset="8274840">A lot of the litigation has been over the basis consequence rather than the nonrecognition of gain consequence and that's always implicit in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.699" offset="8310157">Now, I would like to emphasize what that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.688" offset="8330115">Consider a corporation that has assets, business assets with the high value but a low basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.762" offset="8358431">It transfers those assets to a new corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.112" offset="8371806">If it does so, solely for voting stock, it is a (C) reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.347" offset="8392808">The transferor corporation recognizes no gain but also, the transferee corporation has to takeover the low basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.181" offset="8424051">Now, on the petitioner's view, all the parties need to do is add a little cash to the consideration for the assets and the results would be that the transferor corporation still doesn't recognize the gain except for the nominal amount of cash itself, but the transferee corporation, it's a brand new stepped-up fair market value basis for appreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.912" offset="8519032">And it's that consequence of petitioner's argument that makes the case so important.</text>

            <text syncTime="2164.023" offset="8759463">Now, I would like briefly to say that the history of the solely for voting stock requirement of the (B) definition, it was added in the Revenue Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.360" offset="8804812">Before the Revenue Act of 1934, the definition of assets for stock acquisition reorganization is open-ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.477" offset="8841279">Literally, it only requires that the acquiring corporation acquire substantially all the properties of the other corporation or the majority of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.682" offset="8874088">It did not say anything about what was given in exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.709" offset="8890180">But the Treasury argues that the underlying presuppositions to reorganization definitions require that the transaction partake of the nature of a merger in consolidation, and where a large part of the consideration was in form of cash or short-term notes.</text>
