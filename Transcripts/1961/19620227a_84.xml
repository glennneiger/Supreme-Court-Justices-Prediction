It's been the policy of Tennessee in numerous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.659" offset="8326040">Judge Neill in the Old United Artist case and the famous Curley case, which came to this Court by a certiorari, certiorari was denied but Judge Neill in that case specifically point out that color was not a factor and would not be considered by the Supreme Court of the State of Tennessee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.021" offset="9671450">The Dobbs House restaurants operate the airport restaurant in Memphis under a lease from the City of Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.687" offset="9702170">One of the provisions of that lease provides that it shall be used -- both portion of it shall be used for an unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.603" offset="9741772">In the third offense set up by the City of Memphis in answer to the complaint filed in this cause, they state the regulation issued pursuant to statute by the Department of State Government which requires the segregation of restaurants in Tennessee, which regulation may not be constitutional but which has not then passed on at this point by any court with regard to its constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.134" offset="9883878">The city sets up that regulation as existing state law and says as a part of their defense that if Dobbs Houses desegregates their restaurants, they will consider it a violation of Clause 20 of the lease which is the Unlawful Use Clause and that the lease will be subject to forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.648" offset="9981994">Now, we have sought on behalf of Dobbs Houses and we thought the doctrine announced by the three-judge court was appropriate in that the constitutionality of that regulation should be decided by a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.070" offset="10047613">We are still at that opinion, but we have been brought in -- in the position and are in the position that if we desegregate the restaurant without having that regulation passed upon, the city has announced in the formal pleadings filed below that it will seek a forfeiture of the lease which Dobbs Houses holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.823" offset="10150640">Now, we have said that we think it is appropriate for the state courts to pass on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.725" offset="10170284">The ju -- declaratory judgment procedures are available to these plaintiffs that we -- we don't want to be in the position of litigating with the city or being prosecuted in the state courts if that procedure is followed then it has been declared that they consider it violative of the law of the State of Tennessee if we permit the restaurant to be operated in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.272" offset="10280417">And we say that we are very definitely of the opinion that this is a matter for the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.359" offset="10308838">The State Courts of Tennessee have shown no reluctance to follow the mandates of constitutional law laid down by this Court and other cases and we think that is the simple and expeditious way to dispose it.</text>

            <label>Ms. Constance Baker Motley</label>
            <text syncTime="3047.489" offset="12293308">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.968" offset="12299264">I would just like to summarize the appellant's position and that is that we feel that this case is governed by Bailey in that here also is involved a transportation facility and that as this Court pointed out in Bailey, its prior decisions which were in existence when this answer was filed made clear that any state enforced segregation in a transportation facility was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.818" offset="12426637">So that we think that the law was settled at the time this answer was filed in this case as result of the prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.889" offset="12466970">So that we are asking the Court to dispose of this case in the same manner in which it disposed of the Bailey case by sending it to the District Court and saying your own -- your only authority in this case, in light of our prior decisions and certainly now, in the light of Bailey and Burton is to grant the criminal injunction requested because the facts are conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.838" offset="12562683">And we've set forth in our brief all of the facts which we think make this case almost identical with Burton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.734" offset="12594343">These are the facts which the Court sees from the lease in this case which the city attached to its answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.085" offset="12623705">And when the city attached that to its answer we moved for summary judgment that there was no dispute that this was a public restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.293" offset="12656515">Now, the plaintiff got a three-judge court in this case over his objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.025" offset="12679502">The record makes it clear that we argued that this was not a three-judge court case and the argument and summaries that's in the record and we pointed out that we -- we thought the law was settled that no three-judge court was required here so that they -- when we got these three-judge court, we got to delay in the enforcement of the constitutional right involved here which was not the full to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.468" offset="12781275">And we think that they require us to now pursue the appeal in the Court of Appeals when the question here is well settled and will only penalize this plaintiff or appellant further with more delay which was not caused by the plaintiff in his original pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.044" offset="12859538">We argued against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.302" offset="12864554">We did not ask for a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.882" offset="12874898">We got it as a consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.242" offset="12880332">We got this long delay in the enforcement of a simple constitutional right which I think was clear from the day we filed this complaint that this appellant was entitled to.</text>
