            <text syncTime="569.357" offset="2380779">Our Supreme Court of Appeals has held in State against Blankenship, a 1952 case reported in 137 West Virginia, page 1, that in as much as a procedures set forth in the statute does not constitute a trial of prior offenses, no notice is required before presenting the bill of information to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.470" offset="2469282">As I understand due process, the primary purpose of affording a defendant notice is to inform him of the charge against him, and to give him a reasonable time in which to prepare his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.739" offset="2526333">And it is our contention that such a reason for notice does not exist in this type of cases wherein we are concerned with the application of the habitual criminal act because this is not an information of an offense for which a trial has to be had, but is an information to ascertain the fact that is namely that the prisoner has already been previously convicted of offenses and this fact must appear either by his own confession or by a verdict of a jury before he can be sentenced to the additional punishment prescribed in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.148" offset="2684008">He's not sentenced for an offense distinct from the one from which he has been tried, but the only question is whether he is such a person as ought to be sentenced to the additional punishment and in that relation, we compare with the finding in the Graham case wherein we say that the proceedings under the statutes are for identification only.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.226" offset="6132276">Under the Tennessee statute that was in effect then, he was tried at the same time for being a habitual criminal and for the felony that he had committed and the jury, the same jury that tried him for the offense determined whether or not he was a habitual criminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3701.479" offset="14909315">Reference was made to the case of Collins and Claudy, this was Judge Hastie's opinion of the Third Circuit and it was that opinion which led to the State of Pennsylvania to reverse itself on this issue of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.870" offset="14958843">It is quite true as the -- my Brother Mitchell indicates in Collins and Claudy, there was no notice of any kind to the prisoner that he was being dealt with as a habitual offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.448" offset="15017148">Judge Hastie's reply there was as follows, “We cannot see how any subsequent showing that the accused did not have a good defense can excuse the failure to found one part of the sentence, it's more than the other from the normally prerequisite procedure of notice and hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.817" offset="15102621">We are satisfied,” he says, “that fundamental fairness and judicial procedure required the court impose an enhanced penalty only upon the basis of a supporting judicial determination of the essential facts made after the defendant has been informed of and heard upon the issue of recidivism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.391" offset="15192900">That decision led to the State of Pennsylvania to reverse itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.769" offset="15210454">The state had had decision in effect similar to the one in the Blankenship case here in West Virginia which says that no notice is required, so also Pennsylvania had concluded that no notice was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.668" offset="15257997">Following Collins and Claudy, however, Benzing and Myers that's referred to in the brief, there was a petition for habeas corpus seeking release from the Pennsylvania state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.962" offset="15295195">Benzing had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter and there had been an enhanced punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.332" offset="15316720">He was told at the time of sentence just as ordering peremptory were told here that the habitual criminal act was being invoked but he was not told that he had a right to a hearing and time to prepare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.704" offset="15378160">It was held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that although the act doesn't in terms provide for notice or hearing to avoid constitutional problems, the act would be reinterpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.343" offset="15424763">And it's shown there as here that neither the petitioner nor the counsel objected when sentence in that case was doubled and the judge did not inform Benzing that he had a right to hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.277" offset="15472515">It was held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that there was no waiver when the petitioner did not know that he had any right.</text>
