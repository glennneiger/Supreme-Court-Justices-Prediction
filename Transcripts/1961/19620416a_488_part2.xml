            <label>Mr. John T. Chadwell</label>
            <text syncTime="6.646" offset="129964">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.839" offset="150758">I should like to continue a brief response to Your Honor's question if I may at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.356" offset="176776">The Government's argument as to what Congress knew and didn't knew -- didn't know in 1955 when the fine in -- maximum fine with respect to Section 1 was increased to $50,000 and there was no increase in the fine in Section 14 is simply not borne out their contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.137" offset="259950">Their simply not borne out by the record, by the reports or by the debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.844" offset="286699">In our brief, we have summarized them and so as the Government, each as might be expected pointing out some different things but this underlying fact, I submit to the Court, is quite obvious from those debates and reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.081" offset="351692">That is, that what Congress was concerned about was the inadequacy of the maximum fine of $5000 under the Sherman Act in view of the existence of large corporations and with large assets today.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.874" offset="410833">That was the burden of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.691" offset="422118">That was the point that was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.533" offset="433507">And I submit to the Court that you can look at those debates from beginning to end in vain for a single statement anywhere that corporate officers were under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and therefore, it was unnecessary to raise the fines to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.271" offset="516472">There was a reference by Attorney General Berkson in 1950, five years before the -- before the fines were raised in 1955, there was a reference by him as to the importance of Section 1 and expressing indifference as to whether the fines were raised under Section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.867" offset="598810">But he did not say why.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.041" offset="607587">The reason behind the statement was not stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.314" offset="624619">Individuals are mentioned from time to time in the debates, but obviously, individuals are mentioned in connection with -- with acts done by them in their individual capacity, not acts done by them in a representative capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.681" offset="698075">Now, in Hartford-Empire this Court has recognized that where an individual performs acts strictly in a representative capacity on behalf of their corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.430" offset="749066">Court recognized that they could be indicted under Section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.750" offset="766412">Also, the Court held in Hartford-Empire that where that was the case, an injunction should not run against the individuals personally, but only against the corporations and their officers, directors, and employees in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.759" offset="830360">That was expressly held in Hartford-Empire, that recognition of the very real difference that exist between charging individual defendants with engaging in conspiracies on their own behalf, as the words were in Hartford-Empire, and where they perform acts strictly in a representative capacity on behalf of their corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.675" offset="934118">And I say to the Court, in connection with Mr. Justice Brennan's question of -- of Mr. Wright, that it's obvious and it always has been obvious in -- in -- in the history of the Sherman Act, that where any individual is indicted in a representative capacity, strictly for performing an act on behalf of this corporation which results in a corporate violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.160" offset="1028054">That obviously, he is not guilty unless the corporation is guilty, he couldn't be, he never has been, and the same thing is true under Section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.827" offset="1070686">Now did I -- I perhaps have misunderstood Mr. Wright's statement, but I understood him to say at one time, that under Section 14, the corporation must be found guilty before an individual can be indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.216" offset="1120214">I may be wrong about that, but the fact is that that is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.406" offset="1137037">It's merely necessary that the act done by the individual should result in the corporation being in violation of the act, not that there is an -- that is -- it's necessary to be any finding of a violation by the corporation or a finding of guilt in the early stages of the Section 14 history.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.871" offset="1214882">There was a provision requiring of finding of guilt on behalf of the corporation, but that is out in the -- and has been out ever since Section 14 has been in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.433" offset="1337135">I -- my point is though Your Honor, that if a man is indicted strictly in his representative capacity -- strictly in his representative capacity under the Sherman Act, he could not be guilty of violating the Sherman Act in his individual capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.267" offset="1376423">He could only be guilty of violating it in his corporate capacity or his representative capacity and he -- the fact that he violated the act in his representative capacity would mean that the corporation violated the act that does -- the -- the result is precisely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.078" offset="1451656">I state to the Court that I've argued this very point in three different District Courts, this is the fourth time I've argued here in the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.377" offset="1492929">I have yet -- I have yet to hear a counsel for the Government to give any reason, any sensible reason why Congress adopted Section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.326" offset="1540681">They say there was some provision in Section -- in the Sherman Act already, there were some individual liability in the Sherman Act already, and this perhaps was to reach people who were may be just a little bit guilty, and wouldn't have been guilty under the Sherman Act, but now they're guilty under the Section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.878" offset="1618840">I say that Congress under Section 14 could not have used more inclusive and complete language to -- to reach every violator in his representative capacity whether he was big or little, whether he violated it just a little bit or agree to you when they use the words that they did use which I reviewed in the outset of my remark in which I will not repeat.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.618" offset="1761886">During that period, did anybody -- did any officer indicted for acts done in a representative capacity ever raised this question?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_t_chadwell" startTime="424.471" stopTime="1133.785">
            <label>Mr. John T. Chadwell</label>
            <text syncTime="424.471" offset="1801279">Not as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.169" offset="1804100">Now, I -- I want to explain that exactly as -- as I understand the fact's worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.440" offset="1825102">In the first place, of great many of the cases upon which the Government relies, Winslow, Patterson, to which reference was made in Mr. Wright's argument, Swift and -- and others, it is clear that the individuals were indicted in their individual capacity for individual conspiracies on their own account.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.545" offset="1933563">Indeed, in the Winslow case in the Supreme Court of the United States, the Solicitor General argued that Section 1 of the Sherman Act reaches individuals where they act in their own capacity and use the corporation as a mere guise or façade for their individual activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.638" offset="2005974">Now, that was the argument made, and that explanation can be made of the great majority of the cases that the Government cites, the pre-1914 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.651" offset="2045994">Now, there -- there was an argument in a number of cases since 1914 to the effect that an indictment was duplicitous -- was duplicitous because the corporations were indicted and the individuals were indicted under Section 1 who were indicted in the same count.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.527" offset="2133452">And the argument was, not that they couldn't be indicted under Section 1, but that they couldn't be indicted in the same count of Section -- as the corporation because they would have had -- had been indicted under Section 14 in the -- and of -- and the corporations under Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.308" offset="2192593">The court never did pass on that question directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.181" offset="2208057">There has not a single case, I submit to the Court, in which a lower court has held or the Supreme Court has held, directly what's involved here that the individuals can only be indicted and -- and prosecuted and -- and -- and convicted under Section 14 where they act in the representative capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.159" offset="2296038">Not a single one.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.415" offset="2301053">We have reviewed each one of these cases which the Government has cited in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.270" offset="2316413">It would take too long to review them here but I think I can dispose of them in -- in one of two general categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.899" offset="2351000">One is, they were indicted in their individual capacities and as in Patterson and others, operated under individual capacities, and the other was where the court held as they did in General Motors, and as they did in -- in one or two other cases, Atlantic Commission, that you couldn't tell from the phase of the indictment whether the individuals were indicted in their corporate capacity or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.555" offset="2449638">And therefore, the question could not be raised on the phase of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.620" offset="2469804">Now, I want to make a reference, if Your Honors please, to the Barrett case.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.713" offset="2494255">I believe that the statement made by His Honor, Mr. Justice Black, in the dissenting opinion written in the Barrett case is precisely opposite here and the majority did not find it necessary to reach the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.260" offset="2552456">And if that in that case which our Court will recall was an income tax evasion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.691" offset="2578160">The Government took the position that the individual, though there was a difference in the penalties, could be indicted either under a general act against defrauding the Government out of income taxes or specific act against filing false returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.955" offset="2639182">And, though the majority held that the point was not before them on the procedural aspect of the matter in the descending opinion there, the statement is made to which the majority did not disagree that the basic principle that a -- a defendant is entitled to a fair notice as to the conduct charged to be illegal and the punishment to be administered, would be administered, is flouted if either statute can be chosen by the Attorney General at his unregulated whim as to which one should form the basis for the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.136" offset="2811904">And the further statement was made that no such intent should be attributed to Congress in the absence of clear command.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.734" offset="2842311">And I submit to the Court that there's no such clear command here as I shall demonstrate, and as I wish to mention in connection with the corporate history of -- of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.316" offset="2892675">I have mentioned the fact, if your -- if the Court please, that under the Sherman Act, the -- there were, after the adoption of the Sherman Act, have great many bills introduced in Congress to take care of this subject of corporate representation which it was thought and was not covered by the act as it then -- as it then existed and still exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.102" offset="2987760">And as a matter of fact, all of those bills, 51 of them were introduced through the years, pointed that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.728" offset="3018271">The committee report in 1900 to the House of Representatives, contained the expressed provision that the reason for the bill, which would have amended Section 8, defining person.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.310" offset="3064560">The reason for it is that the action of a corporate official as an agent, also an attorney, does not subject them to the penalties under the law today.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.337" offset="3104684">That's expressly stated in the House Report at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.603" offset="3121821">Now, it -- it appears that the Government is arguing here that the aider and abettor doctrine ought to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.729" offset="3158288">That argument is laid to rest, I submit to the Court, but on -- on two bases and the first one I want to refer very briefly is the Dotterweich case.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.406" offset="3201024">In the Dotterweich case, there was an indictment under the Food and Drug Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.659" offset="3218056">The Food and Drug Act contained a definition of person as being an individual partnership association or corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.743" offset="3258389">Now, it was held both in the majority opinion and in the minority opinion, in that case, that that language did not reach corporate representatives acting in their corporate capacity and their representative capacity, both the majority and the minority agreed on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.844" offset="3330800">There was a disagreement as to whether the aid -- the general aider and abettor statute as -- as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.386" offset="3356923">The majority holding that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.923" offset="3367058">The minority holding that it should not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.987" offset="3383359">Now then, the question is, does the aider and abettor statute apply here to bring it under the Sherman Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="827.979" offset="3415333">Is there any basis upon which it can be contended here that the aider and abettor statute should apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="835.006" offset="3443440">I say to the Court that the legislative history of Section 14 shows beyond any question that Congress not only preempted every single aspect of this subject of corporate representation in the very words of Section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.590" offset="3513762">But that the legislative history shows that they meant to do so and they specifically rejected the aider and abettor doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.160" offset="3544064">As a matter of fact, the opposition to Section 14, in Congress in -- in 1914, took two general theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.130" offset="3587845">The first was that the general aider and abettor statute applied now anyway so you don't need that -- don't need the Act.</text>
