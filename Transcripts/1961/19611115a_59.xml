            <text syncTime="49.287" offset="300492">It's really a very narrow point, a very narrow issue and it is simply where the negligent act of the Government occurs, in this instance, in the State of Oklahoma the accident and injury or in this instance the death occurred in the State of Missouri which law applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.752" offset="1114363">I wonder if you don't have to (Inaudible) involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.276" offset="1128469">Suppose that there was a joint liability, the American Airlines and the Government, the Government would be liable only under the circumstances and the same law as the private party, isn't that true?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="truman_b_rucker" startTime="270.345" stopTime="555.708">
            <label>Mr. Truman B. Rucker</label>
            <text syncTime="270.345" offset="1184789">With this very notable exception which was decided in the Union Trust case and which really gets to the crux of the argument because it reads, the Section reads where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law or the place where the act or omission occurred and our problem here, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said, is basically to determine what those words, if anything, mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.617" offset="1333791">And we are adopting the argument of the Government in the Union Trust case, we're adopting the dissent of Chief Judge Murrah in our Circuit case, in which substantially he takes the position that if they intended to bring into meaning the conflict of rules law and they meant to restrict it to the liability of a private person.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.219" offset="1480286">They could have very well put a period after that, and therefore, all of the conflicts of rule-law would have come in to effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.304" offset="1532635">The district judge sustained the decision of the, I will call them the defendants, first that Oklahoma Wrongful Death Act did not have an extraterritorial provision and second assuming that we did have any rights that they had received or had been tendered the $15,000 and for that prior practical reason had been extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.867" offset="1658859">We appealed it to the Circuit Court of Appeals and the majority of the Circuit Court did not adopt one phase of the Government's argument which appears in the second -- in the concluding paragraph, in which they take the position that since under the Oklahoma Wrongful Death Act, there is no extra -- extraterritorial provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.416" offset="1777037">Then in effect, the people that we represent have no remedy against the Government because under those circumstances, a private person would not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.523" offset="1841507">The majority rejected that and in substance more or less amended our complaint and said, “We will then look to the Missouri law because if a private person under Oklahoma law had been involved in an accident in Missouri, in which they've caused the death of a person and proper service could have been obtained on them in Oklahoma then the law of Missouri would have applied.”</text>
            <text syncTime="470.063" offset="1983613">Now, Chief Judge Murrah, in his dissent took the position which gets, as I say Mr. Justice Whittaker, it gets to the crux of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.517" offset="2073475">It says they are liable, that's true, as a private person, but in accordance with the law of the place where the negligent act or omission occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.915" offset="2135019">Now, what does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="512.240" offset="2152364">Does that mean we're going to take into consideration the ordinary conflicts of law rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="522.433" offset="2193115">The majority of our Tenth Circuit said this, “And this court is committed to the rule that where wrongful death occurs in one state and an action for damages is instituted in another, the law of the state in which the wrongful death occurred, not that in which the action was instituted, controls in respect the maximum amount of damages that can be recovered,” with that we would agree.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="555.708" stopTime="557.396">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="555.708" offset="2326235">That's not your question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="truman_b_rucker" startTime="557.396" stopTime="708.585">
            <label>Mr. Truman B. Rucker</label>
            <text syncTime="557.396" offset="2332923">If that -- that's just exactly the point Judge and we -- for some reason, for which I assume our inability that you must confess our lack of success up to this point and that's the reason I'm following -- ultimately, we'll follow the Government's argument in the Union Trust case, for some reason, we have been unable to get pass the mental block of -- when the act is read, where the United States, if a private person would be liable to the claimant and for some reason, we can't get by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.585" offset="2489762">In other words, we can't keep the district judge, learned though he may be and the majority, though, we were able or at least Judge Murrah felt differently to place an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.266" offset="2572413">In other words, basically we're down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.137" offset="2603969">I may not be quite logical, but I'm at least trying to follow this idea down.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.299" offset="2632600">The Federal Tort Claim Act was for many, many years under consideration by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.846" offset="2670738">If I get my months wrong, it's not too important but I think that basically it seems to me it was passed in the 79th Congress and in the 77th which held the last hearings on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.249" offset="2736358">And there was after these years of study, placed along towards the very last, this phrase in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.200" offset="2812217">Now, that gets down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.413" offset="2825070">What if anything does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="683.914" offset="2839071">We can only believe that Congress, at all the times I assume, I know at least in this instance, had the benefit of the largest and probably the finest law firm in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.383" offset="2908871">We must assume that they, as well as Congress, was aware of the general conflicts rule.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="708.585" stopTime="720.262">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="708.585" offset="2937710">Is there any indication in the legislative history that the phrase that you rely on so heavily here, the Congress was advertent to this what you call the conflicts of laws probably?</text>

          <turn speaker="truman_b_rucker" startTime="720.262" stopTime="812.577">

            <text syncTime="727.250" offset="3012420">One which is testimony of Mr. Shea in which he referred to the locale where the damage occurred, however, it's interesting that in the written memorandum and we operate on the third, it won't be right to write it more carefully than one who speaks, more particularly, he spoke right after this particular phrase was placed on and after to the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.148" offset="3187963">So as to that, I think that our argument could be a bit more sounder, but be that as it may the -- we must assume that the Congress and the Attorney General's office were aware of the general conflicts of law rule first and they were likewise aware as Chief Justice Murrah pointed out that there are few if any states that have an extraterritorial clause in the Wrongful Death Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.361" offset="4412792">The Government in the Union Trust case and their memorandum filed in this Court in opposition to the writ has probably stated better than I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.606" offset="4453752">More -- moreover adherence to the liberal mandate and natural meaning of the clause has the sensible advantage of adopting the law of the State, (a) in which the federal employee is located and it's controlled by his superiors; (b) which determines the applicable standard of care governing the federal employee; (c) which fixes the rights and privileges of the actor and (d) which results in greater simplicity and certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.022" offset="4615502">Now, whether they are now of course take the position and if it will be well argued that it would be more simple to do it the other way and follow the law of where the accident occurred, we can only assume this is more logical and more accurate as this was the position of the department which was advisory to Congress at the time that this phrase was placed on this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.583" offset="4993755">I'm really putting it off, but as to the interpretation of this particular clause which was added on to after the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.234" offset="5064286">In the Dalehite case, though it'd be an extent a -- and dissent, it was said the law which by statute determines the Government's liability is that of the place where the negligent act or omission occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.512" offset="5133458">This fertilizer was manufactured in our way in Missouri then shipped to Texas and speculation is to where the negligence occurred is unnecessary since each of these jurisdictions recognize the general proposition that a manufacturer is liable for defects in his products which could have been avoided by ordinary care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.882" offset="5222902">So then at least we could say that some members of this Court started off with the premise that the law by which the statute determines the Government's liability is that where the place of the negligent act or omission occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1386.903" offset="5650996">So basically, we're down to what might be called a conflict as between the Tenth Circuit with Chief Judge Murrah dissenting and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia with Justice Miller dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.552" offset="5745560">I -- now, let me just outline the facts as to so-called Eastern Air Lines and Union Trust case, which I think will probably bring me up to the noon hour and then I will try to at that time answer the question that has been propounded -- the best I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.614" offset="5869798">The Eastern Air Lines or the Union Trust case was simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.520" offset="5901458">The Union Trust case was an executor of the man who was killed on an Eastern Air Lines plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.370" offset="5932805">The plane crashed in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.999" offset="5951404">There was a suit instituted against Eastern Airlines and against the United States Government, alleging negligence on the part of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.221" offset="6008247">It developed that the negligence of the Government was in the State of Virginia, which by Oklahoma had no extraterritorial clause in their Death Act, but which like Missouri and this is the only difference between the cases as we have seen them, Virginia had the limitation which helped the Government and Missouri in this instance has the limitation which helped the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.098" offset="6147741">In the District of Columbia, there was no limit as to Death action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.975" offset="6167280">A judgment was rendered in the amount of $50,000 against both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.216" offset="6196224">Without going up or down with Eastern Air Lines, except -- let me say this, that the Eastern Air Lines, it seems to me that it was reversed with the ultimate analysis, they finally paid the $50,000 and the judgment was rendered against them in that amount because there was no death limitation in the District of Columbia and there is where their negligence and where the damage and the injury occurred in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.892" offset="6322970">As far as the Government is concerned, although it was conceded that the accident, injury, the death occurred in the District of Columbia, the act or -- the negligent act or commission occurred in the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.042" offset="6403532">So then there was raised squarely at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.314" offset="6424639">In other words, what if anything, do these words mean that were placed on 1346 (b) which were used in other places, in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.068" offset="6527666">In other words, it's difficult for me I assumed maybe those more learned than I can answer them to get away from the argument or opinion of Judge Murrah when he says “Why?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.295" offset="6608541">In other words, by nearly stopping there and putting a period where the United States, if a private person would be liable to the claimant, then you don't have the conditions, you don't have the limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.593" offset="6677713">You are, as far as this particular part of the law is concerned, placing the Government in the position of a private person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.910" offset="6723062">But although it was -- as Justice -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter said the basic intent of the Act took place in the position of a private person, yet that is not what they did because they put on it limitations and they put on it conditions and this is one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.816" offset="6810624">Now, as I say, we are willing to accept the “why” as advanced for the Government in the Eastern Air Lines or rather the Union Trust case operating on the theory as I do, that they -- as advisory to Congress probably knew more about it than anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.746" offset="6898395">Whether that is more logical or more sensible approach for somebody to determine other than myself, but at least that was placed there and can't we assume it was placed there for a reason?</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.546" offset="7077595">And in the brief which we have largely copied, they say that the trial judge having found that the collision occurred in the District of Columbia applied the district law in measuring the Government's liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.793" offset="7134542">In doing so, he purported to follow the general conflicts rule which in most instances disregards the place of the negligent act or omission and instead uses the place for the harmful force takes effect upon the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.801" offset="7198595">This appeal, nevertheless, permits no occasion for examining into the difficult problem, and I want to get into this business which I really don't understand too well except it is a serious problem of the application of the general rule nor does the case have to be remanded for additional factual findings because Congress has foreclosed the matter by prescribing a different rule in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.730" offset="7314265">The Act requires application of the place “where the act or omission occurred, this provision is clear and without ambiguity.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.217" offset="7468283">The Court of Appeals with one judge dissenting, held, they, the majority, hold that Congress does provide an explicit terms for the Government's liability to be measured under the law of the place where its negligent employees after omission occurred and therefore the Act requires the law to be applied in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.400" offset="7636929">Our Eastern -- the fact as I say briefly, the Government's negligent act occurred in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.307" offset="7684577">The act -- negligent act and the collision occurred in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.273" offset="7720417">So the liability of the Eastern Air Lines was fixed under the laws of the District of Columbia and the Government, were able to persuade this Court that their liability was placed upon the -- it was fixed by the laws of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.867" offset="7798888">Now, the precise question was raised by the Attorneys representing the deceased in the petition for rehearing where he says, “Even if the majority adhered to the liberal interpretation of the Tort Claims Act requiring that Virginia must govern the extent of the Government's liability,” it is the entire law, entire Virginia law, including its conflicts rule which must be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.374" offset="7920828">The Virginia conflicts rule requires Virginia to recognize the law of the place where the collision occurred, hence, the District of Columbia law must be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.850" offset="7978820">Now, the Government, in response to that petition for rehearing says, “In construing the statute, we must start with the presumption that the ordinary meaning of the word used in the act expresses the intent of Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.077" offset="8047679">This is from the Government's brief again which I say we've largely copied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.605" offset="8065755">Here, the ordinary meaning dictates a rule which differs from the general conflicts rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.609" offset="8109850">Then, again on page 15, they say, which gets to the crux of the matter in which we adopt and which we have in our brief, appellees argued that if Virginia law is applicable then its conflicts rule must be accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.694" offset="8178186">And that they say would refer us to the place of injury which appellees assume as the District of Columbia, the argument if accepted would in effect increase the renvoi doctrine which has little support in this country side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.611" offset="8237850">In any event, here again the explicit language of the Tort Claims Act given its ordinary meaning precludes abandoning the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.949" offset="8299186">The act's point of reference is the internal law of that State, not its conflicts rule, which may carry us to the law of another state, which in turn may invoke the law still another state, coming to rest family in a situs other than the place where the act or omission occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.429" offset="8401063">The losing party, the Attorneys for the deceased in their attempt to get into this Court, raised the precise question, we have that it would alter the long established conflict of rules law, applying the law of the District of Columbia and the Government in their successful response, not only cite the reasons which -- and actually adopt because they're favorable but I think there's a logical person that we can adopt when they say that they want these things determined, where they know the law of that state and where the actor is and where they have control of them, we must operate on the assumption that the Attorney General's office had some purpose in saying that was included.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard J. Medalie</label>
            <text syncTime="3054.567" offset="12321625">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.498" offset="12341373">The issue in the present case is a constantly recurring issue which in any case under the Federal Tort Claims Act in which the act or omission takes place in one state and the injury leading to death in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.387" offset="12404903">(Inaudible) at the present time, there are close to 100 cases now pending out of recent air crashes in which this issue has been presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.309" offset="12444609">It's for this reason that the Government's interest today is more than a pecuniary one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.333" offset="12472717">We are interested in arriving at a satisfactory solution and propounding a reasonable and workable rule by which our liability may be determined under that Act in cases of multistate tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.268" offset="12536456">Now, as the petitioners have stated -- the Government and petitioners are in agreement that Section 1346 (b) states in clear and unequivocal terms that the liability of the United States shall be determined in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.786" offset="12626526">We defer, however, as to what the content of that law shall be unless the Government says that we should refer to the whole law of the place where the act or omission occurred including the conflict of laws principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.381" offset="12680861">In this case, it would be the court law of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.596" offset="12693713">Petitioners on the other hand would have this Court interpret 1346 (b) as referring to the internal law of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.235" offset="12724328">And American Airlines, our fellow respondents, although agreeing with the Government make -- makes an alternative argument that 1346 (b) should be interpreted to refer to the law of the place of the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.292" offset="12792560">I'd like to turn to each one of these positions in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.912" offset="12811055">The Government believes that its interpretation of 1346 (b) as referring to the whole law, not only complies with the spontaneous and literal meaning of the language employed in that Act, but it also complies with the purposes of the Act as embodied in Section 2674 which states that the United States shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.770" offset="12938428">Thus, since a private individual being sued in a District Court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction, since his liability would be determined according the whole law of the State in which that Court is sitting including the conflict of laws principles, according to the rule laid down by this Court in Klaxon v. Stentor so too the Government would have the Tort Claims Act, Sections 1346 (b) and 2674 requiring the Court to look to the whole law of that place where the Act occurred including the conflicts of laws principles when the liability of the Government is to be determined under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.619" offset="13129853">It is our contention that these Sections, Section 2674 and 1346 (b) far from being exceptions to one another, not as far for having 1346 (b) as an exception to 2674, it is our contention that these two Sections should be read together in pair material that they should be given equal effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.524" offset="13225462">In fact, just on an ordinary statutory interpretation, ordinary rule of construction when two sections of a statute refer to the same subject matter, they should be given equal effect unless they are completely contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.599" offset="13289723">And indeed, the Government's position shows quite clearly that these two can be read together so that one may evolve a reasonable rule to govern the liability of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.475" offset="13337266">Further, when this -- when the 1946 Act was passed, these two sections, these two provisions, now embodied in 1346 (b) and 2674 were included within the same section of the Federal Tort Claims Act which was then Title IV of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.439" offset="13433083">And each was preceded by the proviso that it was to be subject to provisions of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.360" offset="13460773">In fact, the two provisions had been included in the same section with the same proviso in many of the bills which preceded the passage of the Federal Tort Claims Act and in fact, even when these two provisions were put into separate sections after the revision of the judicial code in 40 (a), nevertheless, they were still preceded by language saying that they were to be subject to provisions of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.533" offset="13565471">And therefore, for this reason, we believe that two should be read together in harmony so that the liability of the United States would be determined in accordance with the law of the place where the act occurred in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.095" offset="13655751">In contrast, petitioner would have this Court interpret 1346 (b) as referring to the internal law of the State where the act occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.537" offset="13701517">The fact, under our interpretation, of course, it would violate the clear requirements of 2674.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.859" offset="13734849">Indeed, petitioners themselves at page 25 of their brief, admit that under their interpretation, the liability of the United States would not be the same as a private individual in like circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.416" offset="13797021">It would not be in the same manner and to the same extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.966" offset="13811231">And in fact, in the court below, Chief Judge Murrah, when he stated that the -- he would have had the United States be held liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act, under the law of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.579" offset="13877687">He stated at page 45 of the record that the Government would be held liable even though a private person would not be liable according to Oklahoma law under the same circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.388" offset="13948949">Petitioners, however, say that when this Act was passed in 1946, we must assume that Congress was cognizant of the normal conflicts of laws rules which referred to the law of the place of the injury as well as being cognizant of the minority rule which -- which referred to the law of the place of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.955" offset="14051244">And that when it embodied in Section 1346 (b), this clear and unambiguous language law of the place of the act or omission, it in effect selected the minority rule, the minority conflicts rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.293" offset="14116551">Well of course, the problem with this interpretation is, first of all, that the section does not say in accordance with the internal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.518" offset="14153435">It only says in accordance with the law of the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.722" offset="14170258">Moreover, there is no indication in the entire 28 years of legislative history of the Federal Tort Claims Act that Congress even gave a second thought to the problems of conflict of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.130" offset="14235878">It may well be that they were cognizant of conflict of laws rules, but with respect to the Federal Tort Claims Act, they never consider -- they concerned themselves.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard J. Medalie</label>
            <text syncTime="3572.742" offset="14394389">Well, Government interprets it to mean the whole law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.986" offset="14407346">It -- it's quite true that it might -- it may very well encompass a particular choice of conflict of laws just as it might encompass an embracing of the whole law and then looking to the States for its own conflicts of law, but we must interpret, that would seem, this Section not in vacuum but in context of the whole Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.286" offset="14508492">I think, for example, that petitioners might have had a better case had Section 1346 (b) been the only provision in this Federal Tort Claims Act dealing with liability of the Unites States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.573" offset="14569618">When, however, we concern -- we look to Section 2674 which says that the United States must be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, I can only draw the conclusion that Congress then meant what it said and that when one analyzes how a private individual is held liable whenever he's brought into court and when one realizes that a court in effect looks to the whole law and to determine where the ultimate substantive law reference will be, I can only conclude that Congress also intended that the liability of the United States should be determined in the same manner and to that same extent as a private individual and this is our essential position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.898" offset="14802944">Indeed, one of the problems in this case is that -- is this -- the use of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.021" offset="14835440">In fact, this Court in the Dalehite case which we cite at page 16 of our brief, pointed out that uppermost in the collective mind of Congress was the ordinary common law tort and that the -- and that the example which was constantly reiterated was that of negligence from the driving of a motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.712" offset="14942229">And when one considers what happens when a motor vehicle has a collision, one realizes that the act -- the accident, the injury, the death all occur in a single jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.560" offset="14993638">Therefore, there is no conflict of laws provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.430" offset="15009102">It is for this reason that we believe that Congress did not really intend or rather it didn't even consider that 1346 (b) would, in effect, be an indication of a choice of conflicts of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.383" offset="15080887">The -- what Congress was interested in and it is, I think, clear from what it did in the 76th Congress, which we discuss at page 14 of our brief, Congress was interested in establishing principles of tort liability which would not be based on a uniform federal system of tort liability, but rather that it would have courts look to the laws of the State, look to the local law, look to the state law in order to determine liability in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="3831.687" offset="15430092">The very early, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.247" offset="15436361">In the 76th Congress, first session, for the first time in Senate 2619, H.R. 7236, which we discuss at page 14, Congress decided that the -- that the Government could be brought before the District Courts or the Court of Claims in order to have its liability determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.509" offset="15525386">Once it did that, it began to change its approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.690" offset="15542105">It then began to look to what local law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.845" offset="15558719">For example, in -- in those first bills, they still had certain elements of the negligence, specifically provided for in the particular section, but later on, namely in the 77th Congress, first session and certainly in the second section, Congress established a means by which the District Courts will have exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.264" offset="15672404">And it said and we quote -- and I quote from page 16 of our brief that in vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the District Courts, Congress did it because the District Courts sits in only one State and is familiar with the local laws and decisions that are made pertinent to the determination of tort claims against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.319" offset="15764668">From this, again, I can only draw the conclusion that Congress' interest was to look to local and state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.648" offset="15793925">And when one looks to local and state law, one has to take into effect or take into consideration the problem -- the actual conflict of law provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.997" offset="15843349">Therefore, when a multistate court occurs as it did in this case, little comfort can really be gotten from the -- any hypothesis or speculation as to what Congress must have thought or what Congress must have considered when it passed the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.649" offset="15933942">The only thing one can do is ask what Congress actually did in the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.844" offset="15954735">It's clear that Congress did not consider conflicts of law but how does the Act operate when we have a -- an accident which involves a multistate tort?</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.562" offset="16001651">Well, in the first place, as we mentioned before, you look to the law of the place of the Act and you look into the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.251" offset="16044387">And when those two provisions are read together, the only conclusion can be that the whole law of the State where the act or omission occurred is the only law which can govern the liability of United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4122.044" offset="16591600">They were distantly removed from the deceased and therefore did not have to rely on the deceased for any pecuniary loss whereas the Government would have had to pay up to the $15,000 limit of Virginia since Virginia's law covered so many other factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="4163.667" offset="16758053">And then sitting down and going over the legislative history again, and tying to make sense out of the Federal Tort Claims Act, we arrived at a conclusion that it really should be according to the whole law of the place where the act or omission occurred in order to at least have a standardized rule so that time and time again when these situations occur in which there would be -- there was multistate torts, we wouldn't get into these very difficult questions of how we measure liability according to different acts -- according to different states.</text>

            <text syncTime="6171.505" offset="24789347">It is substantially that as Judge Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.456" offset="24801155">It is exactly said by Judge Miller who wrote the opinion in the Eastern case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6182.754" offset="24834382">The counsel has talked about certain limitations and conditions on the part of the Government, imposed by the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.177" offset="24872103">Well, certainly, there are these limitations or conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6196.838" offset="24890702">But how in the world that the words ‘act or omission' constitute a limitation or a restriction or how could it take anything from the Government or give it to a private indivi -- I just -- I cannot myself follow the logic in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6213.123" offset="24955904">In a particular case, if you interpret it the way they want to do it, it might be to the benefit of the plaintiff in one case and the Government in another.</text>

            <text syncTime="6225.752" offset="25006373">So, I cannot see that those words place law of the place where the act or omission occurred, constitute any restriction or limitation on the Government's liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="6237.517" offset="25053393">They simply say that regarding -- as the Government liable just like a private individual and we're going to do that by applying the law of the State where the act or omission occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="6255.244" offset="25124342">-- Chief Justice Warren, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.523" offset="25145448">The effect of the reasoning which they are trying to argue and enforce here is that the end result is that the law of the State where the accident occurred is going to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6280.039" offset="25223502">Now, whether you did or as it has been suggested by a rewording of the statute or otherwise, they are getting the same result when they bring into play the conflicts of law rule of the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="6299.986" offset="25303333">In other words, it is making meaningless these words “where the act or omission occurred”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6309.759" offset="25342412">Now, then we get to involved in this situation as has been suggested that if these suits were commenced in Missouri, the Missouri law under their reasoning would look to the law of Oklahoma where the negligent act occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="6328.962" offset="25419212">And Oklahoma conflicts rule would apply the law of Missouri as to the place where the accident and death occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="6336.863" offset="25450872">Then we're in to the renvoi theory and doctrine and that it was obviously the intent of Congress to avoid this statute of conflicts on conflicts which you do not have in the case of a normal private individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="6359.706" offset="25542196">Basically, we're down to the feeling in the statement as it was expressed in this Steal-in case that we should make Congress to respect of not assuming likely that it indulges in inconsistencies of speech which makes the English language meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="6380.638" offset="25625893">In all respects, the Government didn't expose themselves to the liability of a private individual and in the most basic or the fact, they did not give them the right of a trial to jury and eliminated many of the other rights that you have as individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6400.502" offset="25705409">So, basically, if you follow their reason by applying the Oklahoma conflicts of law rule, then you're for practical purposes, eliminating the words “the act or omission occurred” because you're right back there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6417.609" offset="25773850">We respectfully submit that the words were put in there for some reason and that it was a good reason and for that reason, they should be given full force and attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="6434.010" offset="25839365">Thank you.</text>
