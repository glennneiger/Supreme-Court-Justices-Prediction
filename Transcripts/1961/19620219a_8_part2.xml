            <text syncTime="11.848" offset="150758">I have -- had portion of the time remaining to me now, so I can take another additional 12 minutes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="17.106" stopTime="18.585">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="17.106" offset="171760">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="18.585" stopTime="263.370">
            <label>Mr. George N. Leighton</label>
            <text syncTime="18.585" offset="177716">To conclude the argument for the petitioner if Your Honor please, I wish to emphasize that the position of the petitioner is that before the District Court, the attorneys for the respondents had upon remandment of this course, filed a motion to dismiss the petition again and the case never got beyond argument on that motion, and that motion was sustained by the district judge by his memorandum order from which the appeal was taken so that at no time was the petitioner allowed the opportunity which is ordinary available at a trial of an issue to make a formal offer of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.091" offset="395786">Now we take the position that the district judge heard in dismissing the petition and not performing the functions which Your Honors have said is the inherent duty of a district judge on Federal Habeas Corpus, to have made his own independent determination of the question whether the federal constitutional questions which the petitioner had urged in the District Court had been fairly considered and determined by the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.462" offset="517204">Now, I wish you to also go back to question which has been asked of me about the position of the petitioner with regard to the effect of this drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.857" offset="566836">It is the petitioner's position that the vice of what occurred to him was that while he was given a drug by a police doctor, he was also at the same time, while still under the influence of this drug, subjected to the interrogation that resulted in the confession used in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.934" offset="667146">The courts below have failed to distinguish between the propriety of the medication and the propriety of the interrogation, while the medication may well be in the mind to some people, some doctors had been proper that the interrogation accompanied at the same time while he was under the influence of this police injected drug, is what creates the vice.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.591" offset="769755">Now, the petitioner can only point to the fair inferences in the record that this was the intended result by the state officers involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.787" offset="814477">It is true, we have no one who could testify that Officer Cagney, when he saw the doctor, talked to the doctor and said “Give him a drug that will produce confession” is true, but it is considered judgment of pharmacologist, the people who have dealt with the therapeutic and the physiological results of hyoscine, criminologists have spoken on the subject, medical men have spoken on the subject that this drug has properties which injected in therapeutic doses produced the state of mind of ejecting in incriminatory confessions and in fact that is one of the uses of the drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.837" offset="986676">Now, it occurred to me to say, if Your Honors please that fair minds would agree that if man were being wheeled into operating room with proper therapeutic doses of chloroform and other means of easing his pains, that is not the time to discuss with him the disposition of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.113" offset="1071835">Most people would argue I'm sure that a will signed by man who was about to be taken into an operating room is not a valid exercise of testamentary power.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.909" offset="1114990">So that while the medication might have been proper under the circumstances, it is the accompanying interrogation with the resulting confession, that raises the question here.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.974" offset="1219271">Now, may I just answer Your Honor's question that are very important that I'm sorry I won't be able to dwell upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.507" offset="1241422">I urged that question before the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.413" offset="1253021">I asked for an opportunity to introduce in evidence the fact that on January 4, when they had a coroner's hearing which I have sometimes describe that Charlie Townsend day because that's what they had that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.694" offset="1306102">It was hearings on Charlie Townsend cases, they had inquest into four deaths, one with the death of Johnny Stinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.046" offset="1343509">In and around, Charlie Townsend were later found items of property of this deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.979" offset="1367333">They took a confession from Townsend, at the same time, they took this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.863" offset="1386872">The case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.387" offset="1392933">Townsend was acquitted because Townsend adequately explained evidently the presence of these articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.464" offset="1421249">There was another inquest in which the -- another confession was taken at the same time, this one was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.346" offset="1448730">The inquest reports are now before Your Honors as part of the additional answer of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.445" offset="1473181">In that inquest concerning death to this man, he was testified by the sister of the deceased that when the deceased was found and his sister asked him, “What happen to you Willis?”</text>
            <text syncTime="353.318" offset="1516648">Willis Thompson said it was just one of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.316" offset="1528665">It was an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.889" offset="1534934">When the doctor questioned him and when the police questioned Thompson, Thompson said I had an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.300" offset="1556564">And as I have argued in the reply to the additional, to try best to judicial answer, I don't' know how in this earth can an accident be made into murder, just because the petitioner while he was under the influence of a drug admitted something about the murder and you can look at the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.529" offset="1621452">The confession is not even admission to be having to do with it.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="382.161" offset="1632005">Am I wrong in thinking that when those documents were coroner's documents, inquest documents were offered by the state at the trial, they were objected to by the petitioner?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="393.985" stopTime="469.430">

            <text syncTime="393.985" offset="1679339">Those are -- those documents themselves never were offered Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.705" offset="1694177">What was done was to bring by inference in the trial that at the inquest, they were other crimes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.480" offset="1725315">As Your Honor can well understand, a defense lawyer who's defending a man for one murder where the issue is question of guilt, he would by every instinct in the lawyer object to such.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.864" offset="1770872">It is a different question, if Your Honor please, in a habeas corpus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.544" offset="1789576">In the habeas corpus, the guilt of the defendant is not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.253" offset="1800338">The petitioner is not on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.142" offset="1807966">It is the constitutional question in the habeas corpus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.903" offset="1823013">I thought it relevant to show that when he gave this serious of six confessions, one he was found not guilty, one man who was killed said that he had an accident, the third one if may I call Your Honor's attention to the fact that the officer was asked by the deputy coroner to sit down because he said you're trying to make his man admit something he didn't do and he said to the coroner, “What are we going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="456.894" offset="1930951">We have to clean up these records somehow.”</text>
            <text syncTime="459.203" offset="1940146">And I say to Your Honors that what they were trying to do was to start off the New Year with a clean slate and they were using this petitioner as a mop to clean up unsolved murders and felonies in their particular police district.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.728" offset="2822248">I think that's fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.064" offset="2827577">Now, may I just conclude now with this final thought if I may Your Honor?</text>
            <text syncTime="685.567" offset="2845654">One of the most persuasive facets of this record is the fact that when Rudolph Janega, the Assistant State's Attorney began questioning this petitioner, he had to stop because the petitioner could not answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.468" offset="2905213">The record is without impeachment from the testimony of the prosecution witnesses that as the doctor was being led out one door, the petitioner was being led into the other room where Janega was waiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.629" offset="2949935">We now know from the pet -- respondents themselves that at ten minutes after ten, they took the first confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.982" offset="2975326">I invite Your Honor's attention to the confession in question, particularly the question that was asked by this interrogator after Townsend was asked, “What did you take from the pocket of this man?”</text>
            <text syncTime="728.919" offset="3019003">He said, “Money.”</text>
            <text syncTime="730.737" offset="3026317">“What else,” indicating to anyone who fairly reads that confession, that the interrogator knew enough facts either prior interrogation of this petitioner or from some of the source that was something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.241" offset="3076368">There is another crucial point involved in this confession that this wallet of this deceased was allegedly found at the street called 37th Place.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.372" offset="3108864">When Mr. Janega asked this petitioner, “Where were you on the night in question,” and he said, “36th Street.”</text>
            <text syncTime="756.894" offset="3130911">Another question was put to him plainly indicating that Mr. Janega knew that the wallet was found on 37th Place by correcting him.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.720" offset="3166229">He offered the suggestion of 37th Place.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.432" offset="3177096">You can read the confession and see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.329" offset="3184724">Now, strangely enough, this wretch, this man who couldn't answer questions, no sooner had he been giving this drug when he exaggerated six incriminatory confessions which are now part of the record which Your Honor thought sufficient to ask the respondents to file with you as answers to the -- to the habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.243" offset="3276361">And the only thing that could have brought this miraculous result was this drug, this powerful mydriatic that paralyzes the eye muscles as described by this petitioner, that separates the connection between the central nervous system and the organs of the human body and thus subdues the will to an interrogator who wants answers incriminatory as shown by the experience of police systems, the world over.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.156" offset="3367999">And on these grounds, we say that this confession was involuntary and as Your Honor said recently whether it was the result of professional incompetence or official malice, the right impinged upon is just as sensitive whether it's intent or would be the consequence which follows when a confession is taken to take human life.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.288" offset="3740505">Gentlemen as the respondents view this controversy as is been presented by the petitioner's petition for writ of certiorari as well as his brief, it is our view that it is -- it is resolved into two issues, the immediate issue whether Judge Igoe, the United States District Court Judge in Chicago, abused his discretion, when in accordance of the mandate of Brown versus Allen, he determined that the issue was raised by the petition where the habeas corpus had been fully and fairly raised in the state court proceedings, having explored there, and that the petitioner was accorded fair treatment and due process and accordingly it was unnecessary to continue any further with the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.207" offset="3996191">That lead us to the more fundamental issue, and that is whether on the basis of that state record there, which we frankly admit is the only thing that we can advance in the State of Illinois in support of our claim that this petitioner in this particular controversy was treated fairly by the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.940" offset="4107160">I think that the last question which was propounded by Justice Frankfurter, a question which relates to the use of the coroner's minutes at this time when during the trial of the proceeding in the trial court, when they were sought to be used by the state for purposes of an impeachment, able defense counsel objected vigorously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.605" offset="4241742">I think that question focuses the attention of everybody upon a difficulty which is present in the proceeding here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1059.744" offset="4342366">The explosion came at the time on the – on the motion to suppress during the preliminary hearing which is outside the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.452" offset="4389177">As the case has been posed here, and with all due respect for a very good friend and opposing counsel, the only breach which the petitioner advances here in this Court between the federal judicial system and the Illinois system is the judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.559" offset="4485622">As we read his petition, as we read his brief, he would just as soon present this case on a sort of a priori basis with little or no regard for the record as it was made down below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.005" offset="4563362">Coming to what we consider is the first and the immediate issue, the question as to whether Judge Igoe acted properly when he proceeded no further with any hearing, but relied after an extensive investigation analysis of the state court record upon the findings of the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.502" offset="4653432">We call the Court's attention of course to the landmark case of Brown versus Allen which is explored thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.607" offset="4677778">The function of a trial district judge and which has laid down the limitations and a formula so to speak of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.871" offset="4730859">We also call attention to a case which came out of our own state, Jennings v. Ragan, which correct and justifiably so, which corrected a procedure which had grown up there of the trial courts relying strictly upon the opinion rather than upon the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.674" offset="4806092">So that now, the district judge is bound before he makes any determination, without further hearing of a federal petition for habeas corpus, is bound to make his own independent analysis and investigation of the state court record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.561" offset="4889579">And if he should find upon that investigation that there is no vital flaw, that all issues raised in the federal petition for habeas corpus were fully raised, were fully explored and fairly explored by the trial -- by the Illinois or state court trial system as well as the courts of review then he is entitled as a matter of law to dismiss the federal petition for writ of habeas corpus without further hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1247.223" offset="5092289">If the allegations of the federal petition for writ of habeas corpus should advance matters which were either present in the trial court record and were not exploited or which could have been made available thereby changing -- a change in trial technique or trial strategy, then I respectfully submit that in view the very sensitive relationship between our federal and state governments and particularly in the field of criminal law and the administration thereof, that a man should not be allowed to change or to adopt a new trial strategy on the federal level, because after all, as I see it Your Honor, the federal statute empowers a federal court to review a state court judgment from the standpoint as to whether or not he has been denied due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.928" offset="5775130">That comes to -- come -- bring us the fundamental question in this entire controversy and the question as it revolves about the admission of state's Exhibit 2 which is the written confession in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.139" offset="5851930">At the very offset during the course of Mr. Leighton's argument, a series of questions were directed toward him on the possibility of Mr. Leighton's claim that there was some collusion between the State's Attorney, the court reporter, the police officers and the doctors to bring about a condition in this particular petitioner which will unable him to confess to a series of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.081" offset="6015666">I think it's only fair to the court particularly since the question was asked several times, although I am familiar with the practice, as a policy I can explain why the State's Attorney as well as the court reporter were present, that is now the matter of record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.829" offset="6274696">And for as you gentleman may know or may not know, the dividing line in Chicago is Madison Street for north and south, and State Street for east and west, so they take Madison Street and cut it right down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.007" offset="6323388">And it so happens that the police districts which are about 40, 42 in number, just about divide about equally and the crime rate just about divide equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.569" offset="6365602">Well, as a matter of policy which has existed in the Chicago -- in the Cook County State's Attorney's office for years regardless of which type of administration was in office, in cases of all homicide and aggravated assaults, police are not, police are not to take confessions, written confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.233" offset="6460270">Now, how does that come about?</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.016" offset="6471450">A man is arrested and he is interrogated by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.163" offset="6492035">As soon as an admission is made, it is then the police officer's function to call the States Attorney's office in the west side of criminal division where there's a man in attendance all the time and he says, “We have John Doe here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.429" offset="6553057">He has confessed to the homicide happening and so and so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.820" offset="6578657">The next step is for the Sergeant at the desk at the office to call whichever of two men are on duty and that call can come in at anytime and he says, “Call the 29th District, call the 36th District and talk to Lieutenant” so and so they have so and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.549" offset="6645530">And the assistant is under certain responsibilities too because he immediately calls and of course his first question is, whether the man is able to talk, is he sober, has he given a statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.200" offset="6696208">In other words, care has always been taken so that the State's Attorney would not become involved in any manner or whatsoever in police investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.797" offset="6734555">In other words, the man is ready to give a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.487" offset="6757334">When the assistant ascertains that that happens then it is his duty to call his office back and get one of the court reporters, now they have four, they are employed regularly, so that means court reporters are out every fourth night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.537" offset="6817520">Now, that is the reason that Mr. Janega and Mr. Matsuoka, the court reporter worked at the 29th District because as Officer Corcoran testified before the gentleman became ill in this case, he had made an oral admission to the Boone murder and it so happened then that the State's Attorney was notified and Mr. -- it was Mr. Janega's turn and he went out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2160.346" offset="8744730">According to the State's testimony, he was talked to or spoken with for about half hour, statistical information was secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.374" offset="8780884">There were general questions about crimes in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.996" offset="8799378">His testimony is, otherwise, he claims that there was interrogation there for period about an hour and a half to two hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.063" offset="8831666">It is undisputed that as of 5:00 in the morning, he was taken from the second district to a district few miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.530" offset="8885478">I might add at this point that that happens quite often in City of Chicago because some police districts have better facilities than the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.401" offset="8916929">You'll note it from this record that while he was held at the second district, he was held in the woman's cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.545" offset="8937514">It was vacant of course at that time, but the areas -- in some of the police district, the areas were quite limited and they don't have much working space.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.732" offset="8974294">Nobody talked to him except by his own testimony, he was asked one question by the keeper at the second police station that was if he wanted food and he refused it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.247" offset="9020374">And then in the evening of January 1, 1954 when a squad of a four men namely Cagney, Fitzgerald, Corcoran, and Martin -- Martin returned to work and would have been assigned to the series of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.205" offset="9076172">He was returned to the second district and thereabout 8:30, the interrogation began.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.638" offset="9113893">As I stated before, Office Corcoran testified the fact he made his oral admission and Mr. Janega was called.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.357" offset="9148792">He arrived about 9:05.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.572" offset="9169690">Before Mr. Janega arrived, this gentleman, Mr. Townsend, already began -- began to suffer his withdrawal problems and he made a request for help and then help was secured and there was no doubt that Dr. Mansfield is a police surgeon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.772" offset="9246490">He attached to headquarters 1121 South State Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.655" offset="9270000">A suggestion is made here that -- that Mr. Cagney selected the police surgeon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.707" offset="9290167">Well, Mr. Cagney had no other choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.158" offset="9299989">He has no authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.092" offset="9303751">He has no budget available to call any doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.982" offset="9315349">He must rely upon the medical help that is offered by the police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.422" offset="9341053">And according to Mr. -- Dr. Mansfield's own testimony, he'd been active since 1940 and apparently been doing quite a bit of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.074" offset="9383685">Dr. Mansfield came and a gentleman had been told, he diagnosed the case as withdrawal symptoms which arise under the fact that narcotics have left, in the case of an addict, have left the system, the human body and the person needs to more narcotics and he goes into these intense pains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.195" offset="9484204">He gave him a treatment, 1/230 of hyoscine and a 1/8 grain of phenobarbital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.857" offset="9522761">Now, a suggestion or more than a suggestion has been made here by opposing counsel that Dr. Mansfield contradicted himself, but he spoke of grains on emotion the preliminary hearing then he spoke of grams when they were before the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2410.069" offset="9743653">But I dare say that it might be radical, dare say that it would be radical at 16 times because by -- according to the petitioner's own medical authorities, the therapeutic dose is six tenths of a milligram up to a little bit over one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.509" offset="9841455">Now, that's a therapeutic dose, and not a toxic dose and I would say that 16 times 1/230th would exceed by far the therapeutic dose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.945" offset="9895163">And of course, hyoscine perhaps is just like any other drug if it's given in excess just like commercial aspirin can bring on the toxic effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.887" offset="9942915">Now, coming back to counsel's observation of the claimed discrepancy between Dr. Mansfield's testimony in their preliminary hearing as against the jury the jury -- their hearing before the jury, I have examined rather thoroughly and as carefully as I can and I respectfully suggest that that's a typographical error and the reason that I say it is, if you examine Dr. Proctor's testimony on rebuttal before the jury and the questions as they were propounded by counsel for the defendant in that trial never once that he speak of grams, he spoke of grains all the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2714.832" offset="10962735">There's no doubt about it that it could be raised, but I think the approach and the argument would be the same that it's been made to this Court if I remember correctly, since the first petition writ of certiorari was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.424" offset="11017070">If you go back to the October term in 1957 when the first petition was filed, you will find that the argument, the materials advanced, the medical authorities are practically identical with those which are quoted in today's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.828" offset="11090735">And if you examine the record and particularly Doctor Proctor's testimony, the toxicologist, you'll find that he'd made reference to the identical authorities which are being advanced in today's controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.604" offset="11137755">So that the benefit of that knowledge at least, the benefit of that knowledge was presented in all that it's asked, makes to the trial court, not only when the question of competency came up before Judge Walker Butler outside the presence -- presence of the jury but when the question of credibility came up in the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.302" offset="11304626">I'd like to make just one more remark about the question of dosage and the argument as we see it has been leveled primarily at the use of the hyoscine scopolamine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.112" offset="11375783">Judging from the counsel or the petitioner's own medical authorities which he advances in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.516" offset="11397413">As I said before, the normal adult therapeutic dose was somewhere five-tenths to sixth tenths of a milligram up to an over one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.749" offset="11438373">Here, we have less, less than 2900 of a milligram which is almost half or I say half of the normal dose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.730" offset="11522278">Now, the -- there have been several questions raised as the possibility of what would happen if this case got back or if it should go back whether there could be a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.113" offset="11611826">Since the conviction was affirmed on writ of error in the State of Illinois and the petition writ of certiorari was denied here with one Justice dissenting, there's been only one claim that has kept this petitioner alive and has kept his litigation continuing and that is the claim that the trial court was not appraised of the fact that hyoscine was the same as scopolamine and that in fact was used by foreign authorities for truth serum purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.506" offset="11785383">Mr. Justice Frankfurter alluded to the order on the writ of error after the post-conviction proceeding wherein that order refers specifically to the point in the state court record and Dr. Hoffman was testifying at that time wherein he said that scopolamine and hyoscine are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.441" offset="11865109">However, you examine the cross-examination of Dr. Mansfield from the very beginning, you will know that Mr. Branion knew what he was talking about and Mr. Branion was defense counsel, a man who is today, even today in the pleadings in this Court characterized as able defense attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.552" offset="11949537">He knew when he was talking about and he examined Dr. Mansfield thoroughly on questions of truth serum.</text>

            <text syncTime="4323.321" offset="17396694">No statement was taken on the Thompson death at all and the reason that it wasn't taken was that the Assistant State's Attorney experienced the same problem with Thompson on Friday night that the coroner did the following Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.108" offset="17455835">All he could say is, “I could have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.898" offset="17467016">I could have done it but I don't remember.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.005" offset="17479346">And the Thompson inquest, if I remember correctly, is the one wherein he admitted that he had slugged, if you will, at least 10 people with a brick as he came up usually from behind and then attack them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.934" offset="17535143">The Johnson -- Johnson as the gentleman, who was struck, got up -- he was found outside, got up stairs to his flat and was taken to (Inaudible) and then eventually to Cook County where he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.843" offset="17586761">He is the gentleman that had stopped off for drink and all he would say, “It was just one of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.085" offset="17615705">It was an accident.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4384.246" offset="17640364">We don't know because Mr. Johnson is not here whether he saw his assailant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.783" offset="17662516">I have tied to analyze the coroner's pathological report and as I get it, the -- the blow must have come in this area here, happened in the evening or in the dark and to use a vernacular, it might be just one of those cases where a person did not know what hit him that brought his attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.097" offset="17743809">A statement was given on that as to how valuable the statement would be if it were admitted, how valuable -- valuable it would be for the purposes of trial, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.138" offset="17803891">There were two additional statements were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.969" offset="17815280">Those are here, also, in support of the additional answer, those are the statements of Mr. Martin, the laundryman, and Mr. Anagnost, the insurance man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.095" offset="17863764">Mr. Anagnost is the man who remember who was at the police station on Friday night and they had to show-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.861" offset="17894797">And there's no doubt, he identified the wrong person.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.740" offset="17906291">And there's been a quarrel in this record as to whether some of the cops began drumming the insurance man and telling him, “Well, you talked -- you identified the wrong man” and that's been denied. However, the Anagnost statement was the first statement that was taken at which time Mr. Townsend admitted that he had assaulted him and robbed him of some $110, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.838" offset="17998764">Mr. Anagnost was an insurance man of the Metropolitan Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.822" offset="18014647">The important thing about it is that Mr. Anagnost was brought in to the room there and Townsend identified him and Mr. Anagnost never denied when that statement was being taken that you've got the wrong man.</text>

            <text syncTime="4802.244" offset="19312306">And the article which is most informative on this subject is an article that appears in the 18th Texas State Law of General Medicine, page 231, published in 1922 which gives the experience of a doctor in Texas whose name escapes me right at this moment but who was the origin -- who really originated the idea of the use of hyoscine and scopolamine in criminal investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.238" offset="19408332">It was he who discovered that upon the injection of a sufficient dose of hyoscine to a woman in the birth stage, she lost contact with the actual functions of the ovary muscles and other portions of the female body that gave birth to children and it put her in what was then colloquially described as “twilight sleep” so as to aid the birth process without pain.</text>
