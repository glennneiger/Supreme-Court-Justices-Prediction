            <text syncTime="18.970" offset="180308">Mr. Ehrmann.</text>

            <text syncTime="23.211" offset="197235">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.018" offset="208520">So far as I know, this is the first case before this Court involving the issue as to whether a woman may be tried by an all-male jury and convicted under a statute which virtually excludes women and an administration of the statute which almost makes certain that there will be no women.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.056" offset="340595">We meet that issue frontally in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.494" offset="370375">Gwendolyn Hoyt was tried on information in the Superior Court or in the court of criminal record of Hillsborough County, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.871" offset="427844">She was charged with killing her husband and the information stated that she was to be tried for second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.054" offset="496598">A second degree murder in the State of Florida is defined as follows: “When perpetrated by an act imminently dangerous to another and evincing a depraved mind, regardless of human life, although without any premeditated design to effect the death of any particular individual, it shall be murder in a second degree and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state of prison for life or for any number of years not less than 20 years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="133.311" offset="637659">In other words, the distinction of a second degree murder from manslaughter was a state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.477" offset="690322">Mrs. Hoyt pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.559" offset="714668">The jury could have found her not guilty, could have found her guilty of manslaughter or could have found that she was guilty of second degree murder having a depraved mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.598" offset="774750">Florida counsel who tried the case, and by the way he is the courtroom today, challenged the jury panel of approximately 60 male jurors with a motion to quash.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.776" offset="847475">He challenged it on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.236" offset="853326">First, that the statute under which the jury was selected was a denial of equal protection and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.395" offset="897944">And that the method of administering the statute by the jury commissioners was also a denial of equal protection and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.290" offset="941516">Florida is one three states which has a jury chosen under a statute which says that women are qualified to be jurors and then goes on to say that only those women who register with the clerk courts may be called.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.944" offset="1096161">Now what happened in Florida is apparently what happens -- what has happened in states -- other states where they had this type of statute, we have cited in -- on the brief the reference to various authorities, mainly that where women have to volunteer for jury service there’s practically no pool out of which women can be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.014" offset="1200441">It happened in New York and it's happened in other jurisdictions because apparently the -- to take the initiative and volunteer for jury service is an obstacle.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.679" offset="2123086">In this case, the jury commissioners through their clerk or through their clerk -- or through the clerk of court testified that they put in 10 names each year and approximately 10,000 masculine names, so that whereas on the operation of the statute only one-third of 1% would be available for jury service, when the jury commissioners got through only one-tenth of 1 % were available for jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.509" offset="2254430">They gave no explanation of this other than to say that they had always done it and this was the testimony on page 17 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.677" offset="2311064">The lady who made up this list of 10,000 names said, “Mr. Lockhart told me at one time to go back approximately two or three years and get the names because there were recent women.”</text>
            <text syncTime="563.625" offset="2358920">And she said, “Well, the reason I placed him is, I went back two, three, or four years and noticed how many women they had put on before and I'd put on approximately the same number.”</text>

            <text syncTime="675.270" offset="2805509">We just used the ones we had” and then a question by Mr. Hobbs, “In putting this in March 8, you didn't pay a bit of attention to this list at all,” meaning women's list, “You didn't use this list at all?”</text>
            <text syncTime="689.132" offset="2860889">Answer: “No, we just used the women that were left in the box.”</text>
            <text syncTime="695.587" offset="2886698">There was no explanation for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.338" offset="2897774">I think it was just -- it must have been that (Inaudible) the rest of the testimony, they just weren't taking it seriously, that's all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="706.251" offset="2929434">Service of women on jury, hardly any of them volunteered.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.209" offset="2941241">They paid no attention to the duty to see that a representative jury was chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.231" offset="2973320">Now, this absence and exclusion and limitation of women is highlighted by the fact that of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.705" offset="3031207">The issue in this case as told by the Judge Rothman's majority opinion was the effect on the defendant's mind, state of mind, of the events which she described in which the court found to be with -- without dispute to be the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.133" offset="3124935">You see, the jury in this case was not called upon to reconcile conflicting facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.255" offset="3153460">There is no doubt that Mrs. Hoyt struck her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.525" offset="3186479">That he was sent to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.090" offset="3196719">Immediate medical attendants couldn't help him.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.420" offset="3206123">He died during the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.529" offset="3218557">So that there was no issue of fact as to her committing the act was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.611" offset="3238828">The only issue before the jury was what effect did the marital discord at her attempts to get her husband to come back to live with her at his flat as you will see from the judges -- statement her flat -- that his flat refusal have anything more to do with her in his declaration that he was through and he is going to leave her and her little boy the next morning for good, never wanted to see her again.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.536" offset="3330570">And it was at that moment which the court describes she happen to have a damaged bat in her hand which her boy had found in an alley during the day, that had left on the floor and just as she picked that thing up, he then signed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.954" offset="3392219">He said he was through with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.879" offset="3395877">He never wanted to see her again and that's when she struck him and struck him several times, apparently in a frenzy.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.407" offset="3430045">She was an epileptic.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.234" offset="3441330">You will see here there was no dispute as to her medical history.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.603" offset="3454809">She was an epileptic with damage to her brain and she went out of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.551" offset="3478632">Now, I'm suggesting to Your Honor that I don't believe a professor at a law school could think up facts of a case which tested this issue of the exclusion of women from a jury more than this.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.022" offset="3536520">This was a domestic affair.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.112" offset="3548850">This was a husband and wife matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.532" offset="3554492">This was -- involved all the complex emotions that exists in a relationship of that type, a woman's efforts to reclaim her husband, his scorn, her outburst.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.335" offset="3609767">Now apparently, the men thought that what she did was evidence of a depraved state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.902" offset="3632024">We don't know what women would have done on that jury, but shouldn't she have had the chance of having a woman on that jury who would have said that -- now, wait a minute, this woman saw her home, her husband, and a father of her child go away.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.244" offset="3725333">In one final statement she made and that came at the climax of the day of considerable emotion in which she had struggle to reclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.209" offset="3769219">Maybe she wouldn't have said it, maybe it wouldn't have any (Inaudible) -- wasn't she entitled to have people who think like that on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.067" offset="3796699">We have put in on the brief here references to sociological studies showing the difference in approach frequently between men and women.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.698" offset="3839227">I think they tend to backup Mr. Justice Douglas's statement that they're not fungible, men and women are not fungible.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.514" offset="3870469">That women emphasize more the home, children, husband, their approach is far emotional.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.733" offset="3911325">They are mediators rather than aggressors in discussion and after all, I don't think that these studies tell us anything we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.593" offset="3962734">They tend to corroborate the obvious because all of us know whether it is from literature, what every women knows by berry or (Inaudible), men and supermen or -- that celebrated song that in My Fair Lady, why aren't women like men, that there is a difference and they think of as different.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.488" offset="4066388">And that while individual women will be different from men about -- perhaps be not so very different from men -- as a class they are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.599" offset="4106825">I am reminded of – (Inaudible) was once introduced at a suffragist meeting as a woman with a brain of a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.720" offset="4155308">And in responding to the introduction she said before I regard that as a compliment, I'd like to see the man whose brain I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.605" offset="4194806">Now, Mrs. Hoyt was denied in a case in which it is thrown into high relief, the mediating, the understanding of a woman who sees her home, the father, the child and the husband going away after as I said it, terrifically tensed emotional day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.582" offset="4294698">I will not go into all of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.991" offset="4304311">You -- Your Honors will read them, but that was the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.388" offset="4337957">It is a question of evaluating how far these pressures broke her down which would have made all difference in the world between a decision as to whether she was suffering from temporary insanity, whether it was manslaughter, or whether she had a depraved mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.170" offset="4401068">And this jury of 12 men decided that she had a depraved mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.272" offset="4421444">And so she was sentenced to 30 years at hard labor and so we are here before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.609" offset="4454881">Now I don't think it requires very much argument just to show that women are a different class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.806" offset="4491661">We live with these things so much, if Your Honor please, that we forget that they exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.504" offset="4514440">It's like a person who is working in a factory and the hum is constantly going on, he doesn't even notice the hum anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.648" offset="4538995">My associate, Mrs. Dreben here who wrote most of the brief experimented by asking men what they thought of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.731" offset="4575357">Well, some were indifferent, some thought -- the moment she would say to them, supposing that a man was being tried for killing his wife or his mistress in a rage and supposing the jury consisted of 12 women, what would you think then and that apparently woke them right up, they said of course, that wouldn't be fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.168" offset="4689042">The thing is that we just get accustomed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.501" offset="4702417">There's been no class I might say in all history that has been so universally and persistently discriminate against in women.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.587" offset="4742750">It's only on the last half century that they've been emerging from a position of inferiority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.285" offset="4777545">They are also excluded from eating spices, but I don't notice that they are having sit outs as a result of it, but there is this short division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.682" offset="4819132">And -- while -- during the certain periods of time as Your Honors know that -- they were -- they had no legal personality at all particularly if they were married.</text>

            <text syncTime="1209.731" offset="4943370">Now, I'm not going to argue the law at length because to speak frankly, nearly everything I have learned of constitutional law in this area I've learned from you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.896" offset="5007945">I mean the last 10 or 15 years has been remarkable for a development of the law relating to this whole question of the selection of jurors, both in the majority opinions, in the dissents and the concurring opinions for different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.774" offset="5071475">One by one, the early distinctions have been removed by this Court such as that it relates only to color and race because the Congress have passed the statute on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.657" offset="5131034">Or, that you have to show prejudice to show denial of equal protection, or the fact that -- our concepts of equal protection have been changing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.353" offset="5205849">I remember in one of the cases Mr. Justice Frankfurter has said, it's about time that we recognize the fact that we now have a different perception what constitutes equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.963" offset="5244197">This Court has been bringing in many of the judges that are sitting here, have been bringing the constitutional question on the selection of jury abreast of the times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.483" offset="5282335">There's no longer any distinction as to it -- that if a class is an economic class or if a class is not one of race or color but of a nationality or of any other group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.386" offset="5333953">In the Hernandez case which firmly states that if a defendant is a member of a class which is excluded and there is no justification for it, it is a denial of equal protection, and that's the situation that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.570" offset="5418695">I suggest to Your Honors that the only issue that we have is whether or not there is a sufficient justification for this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.280" offset="5469477">If there is, then the statute is constitutional, but it's no excuse for the behavior of the jury commissioners who arbitrarily limited what little chance there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.979" offset="5516288">But what justification is there for the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.741" offset="5527364">The trial judge himself who apparently belongs to the old school, if you read his ruling on this subject that women were descended to the level of men when they got equal rights, even he said it's a silly statute, but it's not for me, it's for higher court to say whether it's constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.283" offset="5605522">It's true, the majority opinion goes back to the women's places on the home and urges that, but the majority opinion doesn't -- I mean the minority opinion also regards to law as a completely unjustifiable law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.824" offset="5695697">Women are fully participating in all aspects of life today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.136" offset="5720984">I -- my attention has just been called to another item here that I forgot to mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.905" offset="5752017">I had stated that there were 218 to 220 women who had registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.307" offset="5781588">The trial judge in justifying his ruling on the administration of the law stated that 27% of the available women were on the 10,000 list and the 10,000 was 15% of the men, 60 odd thousand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.922" offset="5880121">How we happened to make the error, we don't know because it was only 3%, 4% and 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.700" offset="5915230">And apparently the Supreme Court of Florida accepted that error and it was discovered when we were preparing the appeal papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.170" offset="5957026">So that we have a situation whether a very few women -- the women were cut out on the jury commissions and then the judge who tried the case in his ruling through a gross error misrepresents the number that were available.</text>

            <text syncTime="2048.375" offset="8297911">Now, I think that the first question to be determined or discussed in any case is whether the statute is constitutional because if it is, then and only then do we have to get to the proposition of whether this jury commission functioned properly or it didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="2074.056" offset="8400624">You may after today, I don't know that, but in any case, all of the glowing statistics that we have to support the proposition that women are no longer the backward crew that we have made them since time immemorial, or I take it brought forth to demonstrate one thing, that is to say that they are eminently qualified to serve as jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.418" offset="8482022">I do not say they're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.725" offset="8491321">They probably were many years ago, but I do say that when this Court considered the proposition in making its dictum statement in Strauder versus West Virginia, I do not believe that it made that pronouncement because women do not comprise 38% of the working force, nor that they have made inroads on politics, business, economic, and social levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.317" offset="8593617">I think they did it because of classic differences that no attainment can change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.468" offset="8618277">They are women because they are women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.240" offset="8629352">They have functions to perform that no ascension of the scale can make any difference here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2149.713" offset="8703227">What move this Court to say what it did in Strauder versus West Virginia was not the reverse of it -- of the statistical approach, but rather that there were things that women were confined to in that their very nature required them to perform to the exclusion of men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.191" offset="8773130">They have to take care of these things not the men and it was likely the opinion of this Court that to require them to serve in this capacity would make it difficult for somebody to raise these children, to prepare the food, to keep the home, and to do other things that woman customarily do and to this day do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2248.151" offset="9097049">First, our statute does not exclude any women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.766" offset="9107498">In 1946 when this was considered, we had a statute 40.01 which is precisely the one we have here which made no reference to women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.916" offset="9144069">They could not serve on a jury on Florida until 40.01 was amended to read as it presently does and as it's cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.292" offset="9177610">Now, that does not exclude women in any degree whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.319" offset="9197672">They are required to be qualified electors just as men are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.420" offset="9214077">The only further requirement is that they go to somebody and say, “Look, I'm not possessed of any of these infirmities that you've recognized over the years, therefore, consider me when you pick up this jury list and include me in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.219" offset="9261307">I have time and the inclination to do this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.453" offset="9278234">If we had said or if we were here on the proposition that women cannot serve on a jury, it might well be a different story.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.906" offset="9308014">I suppose I'd be a little more hard put to answer the position that you've taken Mr. Chief Justice, but now, this simply says, “You are the ones that must go to the judge if we don't have this”, and say, “Well look Your Honor, I have seven children at home and who is going to take care of them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.021" offset="9364438">And he says, “Alright ma'am, you don't have to serve on this jury, go on home and take care of your family.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.354" offset="9381784">So what is the difference if she now decides that because she does have the same seven children, she won't go to the clerk unless and until such time she has the time, inclination, and the ability to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.909" offset="9432043">They have throughout their brief taken the position that why do we have something like this when the judge enjoys a broad discretion and he can release somebody of the requirement of jury duty, especially if they have these pressing problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.704" offset="9479168">I concede that he does and if he does, what difference does it make that she exercises it affirmatively by going to court in response to the summons, or does it beforehand according to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.890" offset="9531935">If she is the one who is able to determine whether she can and will, then surely she should be able to do it now and this was substantially the same thing that you had in Fay, Fay versus New York case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.260" offset="9581464">Now, there the court concluded that it did not violate due process to have a jury that was enlivened by a woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.979" offset="9608317">Now it's true that a woman wasn't the defendant in that case, but even in the dissent it the Fay case, nobody made any mention of the fact that women had been effectively excluded, such as they say here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.222" offset="9657323">The point is, I made the distinction which I think is a valid one, and of course the court may not agree, but I said the difference is in availability and eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.947" offset="9696193">The law does not say that women aren't eligible to serve as jurors in Florida, It simply says, “If you want to become available go to the clerk.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.617" offset="9730884">Now they are the ones who guard the availability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.283" offset="9745512">If they don't go, they're not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.033" offset="9756484">If they do, let's presume that the 46,000 in Hillsborough County had all of the sudden decided that they wanted to serve or be considered for service as jurors, and they all went into the clerk, their argument must be just as sound if every one of them were down there.</text>
