            <label>Mr. Frank J. Donner</label>
            <text syncTime="12.113" offset="151803">May I proceed?</text>
            <text syncTime="20.382" offset="184926">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.148" offset="191927">This case is like the (Inaudible) -- the five that have preceded it, a contempt case arising under Section 192 of the contempt statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.252" offset="240410">Petitioner here was found guilty in a six-count indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.460" offset="265174">He was sentenced to nine months in prison and fine $250.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.706" offset="286177">The petition here raises some seven issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.960" offset="307179">Four of them have been discussed in one form or another during the train of arguments that the Court has heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.306" offset="336645">And I want to confine myself here to one argument -- well, really two arguments, first that the purpose of calling petitioner was to expose him, to do him injury, and second that an important item of evidence which was offered below was erroneously excluded by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.442" offset="445106">This item of evidence, too, dealt with the question of exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.628" offset="465899">Now, let it be said at the very beginning, Justice Harlan, that I accept the premises of the Barenblatt case on the issue of exposure, that is, I -- assuming I know what the Barenblatt case holds, namely that investigation with respect to communism is a legislative subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.204" offset="556178">And that it does not -- the fact that a committee is investigating communism, however, does not raise an irrebuttable presumption that it's engaged in a legitimate legislative endeavor that it has an appropriate legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.029" offset="631515">For example, in the Barenblatt case itself, that the Court's opinion notes that -- notes at least three ways in which this presumed legislative purpose might be overcome by a showing, for example, of an exertion of a power belonged into another branch of government, by showing of a lack of probable cause and by a -- or by showing that there was an attempt to pillory a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.676" offset="762128">So that -- I think that the issue that I must face in my argument is what did the committee do and say which is a -- can be fairly attributable to the purposes of the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.218" offset="840286">What can we say about the totality of the evidence with respect to the purposes of the committee in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="192.076" offset="871633">Now, it goes without saying that the question of legislative purpose is really the milk and the coconut.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.850" offset="902771">It's the exigent thing about this whole investigative process, whether you view it as the justification for the exercise of power under Article 1 or the justification for the invasion of First Amendment rights under the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.935" offset="971107">There must be a legis -- a legislative purpose and it -- it seems to me that the Court has a special responsibility to find such a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.797" offset="1018546">I would like -- since there was some discussion in one of the arguments about the 1857 statute, I think Justice Frankfurter raised the question about it as well as Justice Douglas, I'd like to read a brief passage from the debate on the 1857 contempt statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.971" offset="1083225">Senator Seward objected to the broad language of the 1857 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.652" offset="1101928">He said, “It maybe a subject on which Congress has no jurisdiction, it may be foreign from all the provisions of the constitution, it may be a local question, it may be a state question, it may be a personal question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="264.148" offset="1159920">In response, Senator Bayard, who was one of the sponsors of the law countered, “I am aware that legislative bodies have transcended their powers -- that under the influence of passion and political excitement they have very often invaded the rights of individuals, and may have invaded the rights of coordinate branches of the Government; but if our institutions are to last, there can be no greater safeguard than will result from transferring that which now stands on an indefinite power, the punishment as well as the offense resting in the breast of either House from Congress to the courts of justice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="304.636" offset="1321880">And it seems to me that -- we -- that the Court here has a great responsibility to determine whether or not the asserted justification for the exercise of legislative power really exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.655" offset="1386036">Now, I don't contend -- I must make it clear that merely the result of this investigation was punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.424" offset="1425115">I don't contend that my client was innocently -- innocently hit while waiting for a legislative street car.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.741" offset="1458343">I contend that the committee intended to do him injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.523" offset="1481435">I -- I make that point because I -- I've been -- the court below said, “Well, of course, if a result is injury, you can't -- the witness can't complain.”</text>
            <text syncTime="355.485" offset="1525321">I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.456" offset="1533158">I think everybody recognizes that the price you pay for making a contribution to the clarification of issue as a fact maybe injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.460" offset="1577253">My point is that there was a purpose here, to injure my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.976" offset="1599300">I also would like to point out to the Court something which may seem trivial, if not fearless, but it's highly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.473" offset="1629288">A clue to this case is that it was -- it was a hearing which was held in the carefree days before Watkins when the committee was not nearly as cautious about concealing its improprieties as it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.818" offset="1706611">Here, I think the evidence of what the committee was up to was glaringly revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.229" offset="1732315">Now, the second general point that I want to make before sharing the facts with the Court is that we have to look at the (Inaudible) here of what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.045" offset="1779545">It isn't just one fact, it's the whole pattern.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.309" offset="2664573">The petitioner in this case was the District Director of a labor union, the UE, and he was stationed in Fort Wayne, Indiana where a collective bargaining election was scheduled for February 24th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.031" offset="2715460">On February 9th, the local press in Fort Wayne printed a statement from the Chairman, obviously based on an interview that had been given by the chairman to the local press that the union would be investigated, and the story added that a committee source stated that Mr. Gojack and another witness would be called.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.741" offset="2818382">Now, mind you, this was before a subpoena was even issued to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.960" offset="2839176">The subpoena was issued on February 10th.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.182" offset="2856103">On the same day that is February 10th, he said wire, and it was an irate and harsh wire.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.766" offset="2886405">You'll here more about it I'm sure from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.776" offset="2898526">But he had a reason to be irate and harsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.039" offset="2911483">He attacked the committee and pointed out that no election was pending at the plant, but more than this that the personal -- personnel director at the plant, a man named McLaren had announced to the employees three days before even the public announcement had been made that he would be subpoenaed.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.588" offset="2993716">And there was a third reason why he was angry.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.531" offset="3005524">The previous year, the -- the personnel director had circulated in the plant petitioner's dossier that is that the material in the files, in the committees' files about the petitioner, and of course used it for labor-relations purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.952" offset="3071143">And I cross-examined the -- Mr. McLaren, he said “Why?”</text>
            <text syncTime="745.098" offset="3083786">He just asked this congressman to get this dossier, then he reproduced it on House Committee -- the House Committee dossier and circulated it in the plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.192" offset="5272116">And, I would like, if Your Honors please, to read the interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.196" offset="5292178">This appears in the record at page 214.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.521" offset="5305448">And of course this was a kind of interview that a chairman to be gives the press right before he becomes chairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.192" offset="5336168">And the chairman was interviewed, Congressman Walter, in November of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.196" offset="5360201">And he was asked, “Well, what are your plans when you become chairman?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.658" offset="5373994">And here is what he said, and I'm reading this press account, “Francis E. Walter, who will take charge in the new Congress of House activities against Communists and their sympathizers, has a new plan for driving Reds out of important industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.480" offset="5441285">He said today, he plans to hold large public hearings in industrial communities where subversives are known to be operating and to give known suspected Communist a chance in a full glamour of publicity to deny or affirm their connections with the revolutionary conspiracy or take shelter behind constitutional amendments."</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.005" offset="5535431">By this means he said, active Communists will be exposed before their neighbors and fellow workers and now I'm quoting, “And I have every confidence that the loyal Americans will work with them will do the rest of the job.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.324" offset="5596662">Hearings of a similar nature continuing the -- the account, have been held in local areas, but Representative Walter wants to make them bigger where the public being erred as well as invited to attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.301" offset="5648593">“We will force these people we know to be Communists to appear by the power of subpoena,” Representative Walter said, “And we'll demonstrate to their fellow workers that they are part of a foreign conspiracy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.824" offset="5698644">Now, here too, there is no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.720" offset="5710242">It's been conceded that Congressman Walter said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.199" offset="5724139">That it's an accurate account of what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.989" offset="5735320">The only issue is -- the only issue that Government raised is whether this is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.500" offset="5757367">And I submit, Your Honor, that it's highly relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.739" offset="5770324">First, it was made by the future chairman who certainly ought to know what the program of the committee was to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.094" offset="5803760">Second, and this is extremely important, this -- this statement was the statement that was made immediately prior to this hearing or to turn it around, this hearing was the first hearing that was held after the statement was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.990" offset="5871365">In other words, the first investigative act that was taken under this new plan was the Fort Wayne hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.066" offset="5899682">And, Your Honor, you can find that from the -- in the index which is published by the -- by both -- McClellan Committee has an index as well as the House Committee of the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.547" offset="5941582">And you will find that -- that this hearing occurred directly after -- that is the first hearing after the statement was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.241" offset="5972302">So it seems to me that this should have been admitted into the record by the District Court because it was the statement which most closely reflected the purpose of the -- of the committee in this overall plan and finally --</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.160" offset="6627976">It seems to me that it would be hard to find a clearer example of an improper motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.771" offset="6654412">Now, I don't say that this is the only case in which the committee is improperly motivated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.850" offset="6674787">But I say, it's one of the cases in which they've shown how improperly motivated they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.014" offset="6699447">Now, the Government has suggested that there's something in Barenblatt which says that a Court is bound by the statements of a subcommittee chairman and that since Congressman Moulder said when the witness came before him, “This is a hearing about communism and labor”, he was a subcommittee chairman who conducted the hearing, “That therefore we can't go behind that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.979" offset="6811251">Now, this is odd to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.384" offset="6816893">I presented the Emspak case to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.336" offset="6828701">And I showed the Emspak case that many of the committee members said, “Exposure, we're going to expose you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.594" offset="6857749">And the Government said, “Aha!</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.519" offset="6865481">But that's not the chairman.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.260" offset="6872377">Well, this is the chairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.072" offset="6879692">The chairman of the committee said, “This is our purpose.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.500" offset="6893380">And what's more, this wasn't the chairman who was alienated from the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.233" offset="6912293">He knew all about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.080" offset="6919711">He -- his whole -- his whole course of conduct was intimately related to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.233" offset="6944266">Then, I want to point out that a chairman in an investigating committee has a peculiarly important role under Rule III of the House Rules, “He is the only man who can issue subpoenas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.909" offset="7002990">Under Rule III of the House Rules in Jefferson's Manual, “He is the only member of the committee who was elected by the whole House.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.396" offset="7036949">He was the member of the committee -- he was the chairman who created this subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.273" offset="7056488">And so it seems to me that you can't say that you're going to simply brush aside all of these things, incidentally, the Government does brushed it aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="1959.930" offset="7943084">232, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.700" offset="7950190">The court, after making the statement which I have just adverted to said that he accused the committee of using paid liars with which to frame witnesses, then, “I did not know what paid liars and forgers that you may have.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.714" offset="8022183">“I do not know what paid liar you have here to do a (Inaudible) job on me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.818" offset="8050604">“I haven't had the opportunity to vote myself at $10,000 raise,” and a few others, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.140" offset="8075891">They're all in the record of the transcript of the hearings which is in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.527" offset="8109432">Now, in view of the assertions which is the principal contention of the petitioner that the dominant purpose of this inquiry and of calling this petitioner before the committee was exposure for the sake of exposure, I think that it's important to go back and advert to a number of other facts which occurred prior to the petitioner's appearance before the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.652" offset="8269928">The committee -- the testimony in the case shows that this committee had been engaged intermittently from August 1949 to February 1955 when petitioner appeared in investigating Communist Party activities within the United Electrical Workers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.208" offset="8344221">The committee received testimony in 1951 from an individual by a name of Dekovich (ph) who had been a long time president of the UE and a former Communist that the Communist party infiltrated the UE.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.495" offset="8421334">Mr. Dekovich (ph) had testified before the committee that it's important officials, that is the UE where 99.9% pure Communist Party members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.282" offset="8472534">In July 1953, one Jack Davis had testified before the committee that all organizers for the UE were members of the Communist party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.142" offset="8527914">Mr. Davis had been a member of the Communist Party and had been a UE organizer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.525" offset="8553514">Before this petitioner was subpoenaed before the committee, the committee had information that he was a vice president of the International and was a president of District 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.204" offset="8612237">Now, on February 9, the committee announced -- February 9, 1955, this the period which is involved, the committee announced that hearings would begin in Fort Wayne on February 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.727" offset="8678275">There was a news account which appeared on that same day or the next day which mentioned the petitioner as a prospective witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.001" offset="8723414">On February 10, the next day, following the announcement of the Fort Wayne hearings, Congressman Walters received an abusive telegram from the petitioner, protesting the hearings in view of the NLRB Elections which were scheduled at the Magnavox plant for February 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.453" offset="8829158">Now, four days later, on February 14, a Mr. Goldstein, who was a Washington representative for the UE requested an interview with Congressman Walters for the purpose of discussing a continuance of the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.145" offset="8907943">A transcript of the interview between Mr. Goldstein and Congressman Walters is in the record and is set forth at pages 76 to 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.036" offset="9003551">Now, on the occasion of this interview, Mr. Goldstein said that he had asked for this interview to request the postponement and to find out, this is on page 77, whether you and the committee were aware of the fact that this election was scheduled for the 24th and Chairman Walter said “Not until we received an insulting telegram.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.749" offset="9118386">After I received that telegram, then I became aware of the fact that there was an election being held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.904" offset="9147016">We had previously absolutely no knowledge of it, and the only reason we decided on this hearing there was because these people are there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.127" offset="9187871">So that the evidence in the case conclusively shows that the committee when it decided and announced the Fort Wayne hearings had no knowledge of the Magnavox elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.850" offset="9254745">Now they also relying on a -- on a newspaper, petitioner relies on a newspaper account in which there was a reference made to union-busting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.128" offset="9299884">The writer of that account testified at the trial and was present at this conference which was recorded and is part of the record between Congressman Walter and Mr. Goldstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.510" offset="9369370">At that -- to go back that conference for a minute, Mr. Goldstein and this is also on page 77 said, “Let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.130" offset="9411897">As far as I am concerned, this visit of mine was simply for the purpose of asking the question that I mentioned a moment ago, whether or not you were aware of that election, and if not, to tell you about it, and to say this: that it looked to us and it would look to a lot of people as though the coincidence of the two was more than a coincidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.813" offset="9478666">Now, I am saying that without accusing you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.711" offset="9490265">Chairman Walter, “I do not care if you accuse me or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.109" offset="9507819">I do not care what you have to say about me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.702" offset="9518164">But this telegram said very definitely that this was a case of union-busting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.667" offset="9538017">Now, there is no one on this committee interested in busting unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.964" offset="9555257">All of us have very established records, but all of us are interested in seeing your union go out of business, because we do not believe it is good for the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.000" offset="9595382">And the Court of Appeals with respect to that statement, that Congressman Walters made in retort to the suggestion -- suggested accusation made by Mr. Goldstein had this to say, and this at page 25 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.124" offset="9675839">The Court of Appeals said, “It can be gleaned that Mr. Walter showed some displeasure which, under the circumstances, and having in mind the abusive and insulting telegram, can be understood and as readily be excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.336" offset="9732681">Congressmen are more fortunate than judges in at least this respect, that when attacked unjustly, they are at liberty to defend themselves, and to express themselves forcefully and vigorously.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.986" offset="9795271">Now, later on -- it is also interesting to note that Mr. Goldstein at this interview, which was recorded and really took the form of a committee hearing, refused to -- to be sworn to -- to state under oath that he knew as a matter of fact that there was going to be an election held on the date indicated and that it was that reason that he requested in the -- the continuance of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.219" offset="9920240">Since he refused to make a part of assertion on that score, this particular meeting adjourned without any action being taken on the request for a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.530" offset="9989517">A few days later, there was a telegram sent from petitioner's counsel to these -- the committee requesting a continuance, that was at first denied, but later on, Mr. Tavenner's testimony shows that when he checked into the question of the hearing at Magnavox and found out the hearing was coming up, he got in touched with Mr. Walter and there was a continuance granted.</text>
