            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 400, Central Railroad Company of Pennsylvania, Appellant, versus, Pennsylvania.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roy J. Keefer</label>
            <text syncTime="15.489" offset="165282">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.939" offset="183150">The state statute at issue in this case imposes a tax on the capital stock of corporations organized under the laws of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.084" offset="231737">It provides that tangible personal property permanently located outside the State should be excluded also exempt assets such as United States securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.571" offset="285654">The tax has been construed by the Pennsylvania courts and by this Court as a property tax on the assets of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.547" offset="325569">This case presents the validity of the property tax assessment made by Pennsylvania upon the entire fleet of appellant's freight cars numbering 3074.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.539" offset="389517">The assessment included tax also on all of appellant's locomotives numbering 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.347" offset="424730">The tax was challenged under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses on the ground that an average number of the locomotives and freight cars had acquired a situs outside the State or were habitually and substantially employed outside the State and therefore, Pennsylvania lack power and jurisdiction to tax them.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.788" offset="526503">The tax was challenged also under the Equal Protection Clause on the ground that the claim made by appellant for exclusion of certain freight cars denied to it, was allowed to other railroads under similar circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.792" offset="606542">The Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County Pennsylvania sustained the tax as assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.750" offset="630366">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania modified the judgment of the trial court by excluding from the tax an average of 13 locomotives claimed by appellant to have acquired a situs outside the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.098" offset="691806">But the court sustained the tax on all of appellant's locomotives or all of appellant's freight cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.392" offset="728900">The tax on the freight cars is here on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.866" offset="750843">Appellant, Central Railroad Company of Pennsylvania is a Pennsylvania corporation, having its nominal domiciliary office at Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania, but having its principal business operating office at Jersey City, New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.338" offset="824717">The state court reached the conclusion that all of appellant's freight cars had their taxable situs in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.100" offset="863796">Now, since the principal issue before this Court under the process of Commerce Clauses turns on the determination of the question of situs or of the power and jurisdiction of Pennsylvania to tax is within the province of this Court to analyze the facts in order to apply the law and thus ascertain whether the conclusion reached by the state court can be supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.251" offset="980407">The facts have been stipulated by the parties and are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.219" offset="1000260">However, they are important and I shall summarize them as briefly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.261" offset="1032443">All of the capital stock of appellant is owned by the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, which for brevity will be referred to hereafter as CNJ.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.362" offset="1080822">Appellant's railroad trackage of 207 miles lies wholly within Pennsylvania and extends from Scranton and Wilkes-Barre to the Pennsylvania, New Jersey border at Easton where it connects with railroad lines operated by CNJ of New Jersey to Jersey City and to points on the North -- North Jersey shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.641" offset="1197955">Appellant and CNJ share offices, officers, administrative and clerical personnel at offices in Jersey City, New Jersey and New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.400" offset="1260962">Appellant conducts its railroad operations at and from the Jersey City office.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.649" offset="1285935">These operations consist of maintenance and repair of railroad equipment, assignment of locomotives to train movements, assignment of freight cars to meet the demands of shippers, accounting and settlement with all carriers and with all users of its equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.251" offset="1384364">There are two separate and distinct types of use of appellant's railroad equipment, the one under the operating agreement between appellant and CNJ and the other, under the car service and Per Diem Agreement of the Association of American Railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.213" offset="1488227">First, the operating agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.493" offset="1505364">On August 5, 1946, Central Railroad -- I'm sorry, prior to August 5, 1946, CNJ operated its railroad lines in New Jersey and it operated also the railroad lines in Pennsylvania from Easton to Wilkes-Barre and Scranton.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.687" offset="1610167">On August 5, 1946, appellant with a consent of the Interstate Commerce Commission took over the operation of the railroad lines in Pennsylvania and entered into an operating agreement with CNJ in order to continue the existing through freight and passenger service over the respective lines of the two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.467" offset="1721240">The agreement provided that each should furnish its fair share of locomotives and equipment necessary to operate the through service.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.413" offset="1768991">And also, that whenever any unit of locomotive or other equipment of the one party entered onto the lines of the other party, it should thereupon be temporarily leased to the other party until returned -- and operated by the other party until returned to the owner's lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.765" offset="1882467">Pursuant to disagreement and to the stipulation of the parties in this case, appellant's locomotives and freight cars in the course of through freight shipments originating either on its own lines in Pennsylvania or on the lines of CNJ in New Jersey run on fixed routes and regular schedules over the railroad lines of both companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.241" offset="2008377">And for that use, appellant received a share of the freight revenue and while its equipment was on the lines of CNJ in New Jersey, it received a mileage rate for its locomotives and a per diem rental for its freight cars.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.846" offset="11546728">Now, Your Honors, I'd like to leave that phase of the case because I think we've touched the bottom of principal points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.257" offset="11580374">They remain to additional points that I will cover them quite briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.376" offset="11604825">The second point is that appellant's freight cars are exposed to multiple taxation in violation of the Commerce Clause, but that point, it must have necessity be based upon the assumption that other States, nondomiciliary States, had the power to levy a property tax on some of appellant's parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.225" offset="11724257">And if it -- if -- if one or more other States did have such a power, we submit that they did, then the existence of that power, even though it was an exercise like in New Jersey, Your Honor, exposes appellant's property to multiple taxation and that's in violation of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.267" offset="11816417">Now, the appellee will argue that multiple taxation isn't involved because appellant hasn't paid any property tax on its freight cars to any other States, but we submit that that isn't the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.854" offset="11870751">The test is not what other States did or did not do but what Pennsylvania could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.893" offset="11894993">The last issue involves discrimination against appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.451" offset="11917145">The parties have stipulated that in -- that in assessing capital stock tax against railroads having trackage outside the State an apportionment was allowed to them for their freight cars which they owned while those freight cars were on the lines of other railroads outside of Pennsylvania under interchange just the same as appellant's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.555" offset="12033546">Now, appellant contends that they didn't -- the denial of a similar apportionment to it constitutes discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.618" offset="12077850">The state court denied discrimination on the ground that valid classification could be made and was made in the statute between appellant having no trackage outside the State and other railroads having trackage outside the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.027" offset="12159457">Now, we submit that any such classification is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.894" offset="12182967">For example, if freight cars while on the lines of other railroads under per diem rental and interchange do not acquire a situs, as the State Court held, apart from the owner's domicile, the domiciliary State and therefore, the domiciliary State has constitutional power to levy an apportioned property tax upon all of the freight cars then I submit that the exercise of that power against the appellant and a failure to exercise it against railroads even though they have trackage outside the State constitutes the very essence of discrimination because even in the case of railroads with trackage outside the State, while their freight cars are on the lines of other railroads, the state -- the state court's decision said, “Well, those didn't acquire a situs apart from the domicile of the owner in Pennsylvania.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.217" offset="12444191">Well, now, if they didn't and Pennsylvania had the power to tax and didn't tax them then I submit that the appellant is being discriminated begins because it's not treated the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.142" offset="13011989">I believe we could summarize the problem here by saying this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.832" offset="13034663">The Commonwealth and the courts below relied upon the New York Central versus Miller case and we think that's controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.283" offset="13076459">The taxpayer contends that later decisions by this Court and so modified the impact of the New York Central case has to set up a different rule as the domiciliary taxation of freight cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.799" offset="13138526">I'd like to point out what I consider the salient factors in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.708" offset="13162245">As you've already heard, this is a domestic corporation incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania for the business of operating a railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.971" offset="13199235">It has no tracks outside Pennsylvania, operates no railroads and no trains outside Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.295" offset="13236537">When its cars go outside Pennsylvania, they are not being used in the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania's business but they're being used in the business of another railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.090" offset="13287737">The Central Railroad of Pennsylvania is not authorized to do business in any other State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.936" offset="13311143">It pays no corporation taxes, privilege, property or otherwise in any other State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.989" offset="13343326">It has the same officers as CNJ and these same officers have filed reports in Pennsylvania where CNJ does the same thing as Central of Pennsylvania does in New Jersey to the effect that they're not doing business here and they are not taxed in Pennsylvania for doing the converse of this very same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.330" offset="13436740">In fact, Pennsylvania tax has no or as of any other railroad, it is not doing business within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.159" offset="13472057">Our court has construed the capital stock tax which is here involved as being on the actual failure of the capital stock as represented by a property and assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.590" offset="13521690">This tax has determined by fixing actual value under a number of statutory factors, one being the net worth, assets less liabilities, one being the earnings, whether they go into surplus or dividends and in some instances, the market value or the -- or the value of the stock sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.085" offset="13615731">Now, the property used in Pennsylvania in operation to outside Pennsylvania is exempt such as U.S. securities are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.391" offset="13660975">This exemption is achieved by a fraction in which the numerator contains all the taxable assets and the denominator contains all the assets and that is applied against this value of the capital stock, so that while this is represented by property in a sense, this tax is actually on capital stock value and not directly on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.005" offset="13771421">This tax has also been construed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not opined to what I would call the “converse situation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.662" offset="13806007">A corporation having property in Pennsylvania which is merely leased and not operated by that corporation is not subject to the capital stock tax, so that this case is consistent with prior rulings of our court in saying that we as a domicile can tax all the property not being operated outside the State in business as well as by saying, if we do not tax, the property of outside corporations which is not being used in Pennsylvania in their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.117" offset="13943829">I think you've recognized the alternatives to the position of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.875" offset="13966921">This railroad if -- if that position is reversed will be subject to tax in all 48 States because its cars were rumbling around through all 48 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.941" offset="14015091">To me, that is a horrendous alternative to this situation in which we find ourselves here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.712" offset="14050200">This is an exemption and it should be strictly construed under both our laws and the rules promulgated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.943" offset="14087189">Now, we take the position that Pennsylvania as a domiciliary State may tax all rolling stock unless that rolling stock has acquired a situs outside Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.636" offset="14145912">We contend that that puts the burden of proof on the taxpayer to show that there is a tax situs acquired whether it'd be permanent or whether it'd be the type that was discussed here, this afternoon, a body of cars continuously in one State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.783" offset="14226474">You may recall that the Cream of Wheat case, Cream of Wheat versus Grand Forks where this Court said that even though the business and property of a corporation is outside the State, the State of domicile can still tax it and that the only limitation imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment is merely that a State may not tax a resident for property which has acquired a permanent situs beyond its boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.407" offset="14353011">The Court went on to say the limitation upon the power of taxation does not apply even the tangible personal property without the State of the corporation's domicile if like a seagulling vessel, her property has no permanent situs elsewhere and anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.007" offset="14423437">And this case was held that there's still good law and Newark Fire Insurance Company case decided number of years later in a concurring opinion by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, joined him by Justices Black and Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.671" offset="14490102">They assert in that case the extent of the State's taxing power over a corporation of its own creation recognizing the Cream of Wheat case has neither been restricted nor impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.211" offset="14540257">That case has not been cited otherwise than with approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.045" offset="14559587">Well, that brings me to the New York Central case and in view of the crucial part that case has to play in our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.870" offset="14590830">I would like to refer to it in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.438" offset="14605145">The railroad involved there was a domestic corporation owning or hiring lines without as well as within the State, having arrangements with other carriers for through transportation, routing, and railing and sending its cars to points without as well as within the State and over other lines as well as on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.803" offset="14690617">This Court in its opinion in 202 U.S. by Mr. Justice Holmes described the business of the railroad in these words and noticed the similarity between Justice Holmes' description of their business and the business of this tax fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.674" offset="14758118">The cars often are out of the relator's possession for some time, and may be transferred to many roads successively and even may be used by other roads for their own independent business before they return to the relator or the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.869" offset="14822797">In short, by the familiar course of railroad business, a considerable portion of the relator's cars constantly is out of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.963" offset="14863235">And on this ground, the relator contended that that proportion should be deducted from its entire capital in order to find the capital -- the capital stock employed within the State, discontents and the controller had disallowed, and then the proceedings were remitted back to him to find whether any of Central's rolling stock was used exclusively on the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.169" offset="14960097">“At the rehearing, no evidence,” I'm quoting now, “It was offered to prove that any of the relator's cars or engines were used continuously and exclusively outside the State during the whole tax year.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.615" offset="15021850">The evidence did show movements of particular cars in central mileage and car mileage inside and outside the States in order to show, "That a certain proportion of cars, although not the same cars, was continuously without the State during the whole tax year.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.999" offset="15099382">That's precisely the situation we have here with this taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.546" offset="15121533">Parenthetically, it should be noted that in this case, we think the appellant has offered no evidence as to freight cars continuously outside Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.189" offset="15168136">It relies on this ratio of car days in Pennsylvania over car days everywhere as a basis for its allocation of freight cars in the Exhibit Y to which Mr. Keefer has referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.786" offset="15226546">Now, in deciding the New York Central case, this Court construed the New York tax in the same light as our Pennsylvania capital stock tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.992" offset="15267297">And this is the language that I'd like to refer to on page 596 of 202 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.581" offset="15301674">“It is true that it has been decided that property, even of a domestic corporation, cannot be taxed if it is permanently out of the State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.363" offset="15344828">And for that, they cite the Union Refrigerator case, which Mr. Justice Frankfurter referred to the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western case versus Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.025" offset="15383489">And I'd -- I'd like the pause here to point out that this Union Refrigerator case preceded the New York Central decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.936" offset="15419120">The New York Central decision came afterward and the unsuccessful party in that case cited these refrigerator cases in support of his position to no avail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.160" offset="15471992">Resuming the quote, "But it has not been decided, and it could not be decided, that a State may not tax its own corporations for all their property within the State during the tax year, even if every item of that property should be taken successively into another State for a day, a week or six months and then brought back, using the language of domicile, which now so frequently has applied to inanimate things, the State of origin remains the permanent -- permanent situs of the property, notwithstanding its occasional excursions to foreign parts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.379" offset="15632906">In the present case, it does not appear that any specific cars or any average of cars was so continuously in any other State to be taxable there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.594" offset="15677733">The absences relied on were not in the course of travel upon fixed routes but random excursions of casually chosen cars determined by the varying orders of particular shippers and the arbitrary convenience of other roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.894" offset="15746905">And the Court went on to say that they need not consider the parallelism between liability elsewhere and immunity at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.561" offset="15797582">Well, this case was followed by the Northwest Airlines case where the State of Minnesota was permitted to tax in full of fleet of airplanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.087" offset="15843767">And then by the Standard Oil versus Peck case, the decision -- the majority opinion written by Mr. Justice Douglas and it's my impression that the taxpayer here is contending that the Standard Oil versus Peck case rendered obsolete these earlier decisions and would require Pennsylvania to apportion these freight cars that are going around in other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.827" offset="15966647">But if you study the decision in the -- in the Standard Oil versus Peck case, you'll find an entirely different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.708" offset="15998203">There, the Standard Oil Company was operating in its barges in Tennessee, Indiana, Kentucky and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.312" offset="16036655">They did not operate them at all in Ohio which was a State attempting to tax them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.357" offset="16056822">The only time these barges came in to Ohio was to go to Cincinnati to get some repairs and maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.366" offset="16084825">And for 17.5 miles trip of water that they had to pass through in order to get to one of the Kentucky ports across the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.843" offset="16118784">So that, here you have a case where the barges of the company was operating on were never -- never in the domiciliary State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.833" offset="16158699">That's one main distinction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.157" offset="16167999">Here, all of these cars are in the State of Pennsylvania and sometime around or other, they have to start there and they have to go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.533" offset="16201540">Under this car hire agreement between the railroads, there's an obligation to route them back at -- in a convenient manner and we've printed some of that in the appendix to our brief to show some of those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.985" offset="16263293">The second important difference is, and this is a difference that applies to practically all the cases relied upon by the appellant, in the Standard Oil versus Peck case, the taxpayer was operating the barges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.329" offset="16336645">It was his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.189" offset="16344168">He was doing business in four other States, namely, operating his barges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.511" offset="16369455">That's true also of the Airlines cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.464" offset="16385233">It's also true of the Refrigerator and the Pullman cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.382" offset="16400906">Because in those cases, the Pullman Company is engaged in the business of furnishing Pullman service and they're doing that business when they put their cars on a train.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.334" offset="16456704">The tank line companies are engaged in the business of leasing tank cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.298" offset="16476557">And when they lease tank cars to the different States, different people who rent them, they are doing business, the tank car business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.272" offset="16516472">But in this particular case, when these cars were sent out on these other railroads, it's not in further into the business of the taxpayer but it's in the -- in somebody else's business, some other railroads business that these cars are being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.975" offset="16587316">I think that's a basic -- an essential distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.236" offset="16604348">Now, there have been no decisions of this Court on this point but I do have one case in the State of Kentucky where they caught up with this situation and tried to tax the Union Pacific Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.895" offset="16670908">State of Kentucky imposed a property tax and a franchise tax on the Union Pacific Railroad for its freight cars which were going through the State under these car hire agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.667" offset="16722004">Now, this was a lower court case, but it's the only case that I could find and -- and its one more case than the counsel for the appellant could find.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.943" offset="16759097">And I think that it's significant because it shows the thinking of at least one court and explains perhaps the reason why the States have not tried to tax these roaming freight cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.158" offset="16811969">After discussing the tank line and the tank car and the refrigerator cases, the Kentucky court said this, "A railroad freight car, however, is primarily designed for the use of the owning carrier on its own line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.131" offset="16875917">It is not sent by its owner on for the line of another carrier in the prosecution of its owner's business which is to carry freight on the line of such owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.607" offset="16917817">It is sent on to the line of the connecting carrier for the convenience of the shipper, and because the United States Government requires railroads to do so and through routing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.132" offset="16959927">The tank line and like companies received a substantial profit from the use of their cars within the foreign states or at least their cars are so employed or used in an effort to make such a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.868" offset="17014888">But the railroads do not send their cars into other States in an effort to make any profit from them while there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.121" offset="17043832">The foreign railroads are not doing business in such States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.518" offset="17057416">These are tank line and like companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.445" offset="17069119">Although the freight cars of the foreign railroads are present in this State form time to time, that each one is but temporarily so in the cohesive principle which brings changing units together to form a whole which may be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.271" offset="17132440">That is the use an employment of them together as a whole by the owner in the prosecution of some purpose of his, usually business is absent.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4288.148" offset="17255946">So you see -- if you look at the reverse side of the coin as to what powers these other States might have in taxing, you'll find one State already has rejected that possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.264" offset="17308400">And we think that it stems back to the central rail or the New York Central versus Miller case which certainly holds that these railroad cars are taxable at the domicile of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.793" offset="17370572">Now, one of the contentions has to do with Standard Oil versus Peck that I mentioned a minute ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.219" offset="17392201">I'd like to point out that this Court in deciding Standard Oil versus Peck did not overrule the New York Central case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.131" offset="17431907">This is what they said about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.414" offset="17440998">New York ex rel. so forth versus Miller, “Sustained a tax by domiciliary State on all rolling stock of a railroad.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.660" offset="17482062">But in that case, it did not appear that, “any specific cars or any average of cars” was so continuously in another State as to be taxable there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.922" offset="17535039">Then in Northwest Airlines cases, the decision is mentioned and a similar statement made about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.164" offset="17568057">Then Justice Douglas states, “Those cases, though exceptional along their facts, though a straight, the reach of the taxing power of the State of the domicile is contrasted to that of the other States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.426" offset="17621034">But they have no application here, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.866" offset="17634826">Since most, if not all, of the barges and boats which Ohio has taxed were almost continuously outside Ohio during the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.131" offset="17675891">And I think that made a great difference in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.830" offset="17690728">We also, of course, have the obligation to -- to -- for interstate commerce purposes of apportioning tax values.</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.330" offset="17732733">But here, it's our position that there is no interstate commerce because this railroad doesn't operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.892" offset="17754990">It's aligned outside, that kind of interstate commerce that will require this kind of apportionment and as a matter of fact, it pays no taxes and we think we'll not have to pay any taxes in the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="4448.644" offset="17897932">And our reasons for that were -- that these trains, when they cross in New Jersey were operated entirely by the Center Railroad in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.944" offset="17943176">This was a no sense on operation by the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.693" offset="17962193">And if you -- if you read the operating agreement, that is very clear because of responsibility for the equipment and the personnel, the passengers and freight is all assumed by the -- by the other company, the company that's actually operating the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.238" offset="18028335">And when you're in New Jersey, it's the CNJ that's operating the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.414" offset="18045053">Now, it was our -- our position -- another interesting thing about it is that the -- this locomotive rental was determined by the -- the depreciated value of a locomotive and they added five mills to pay for the tax which is what our Pennsylvania tax is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.012" offset="18131466">So that, we contend that the Central Railroad in New Jersey, when they paid the rental to Pennsylvania was actually not only paying rental but they were paying the five mills tax that -- that they were trying to get here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.803" offset="18190608">But as to the freight cars themselves, if you examine the operating agreement, you'll find that the freight cars come under this car hire agreement with the other 26 railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.890" offset="18246928">And I -- I think it's pretty naïve to assume that all the freight cars of Central Railroad of Pennsylvania run back and forth like the diesel locomotives do.</text>

            <text syncTime="4708.245" offset="18936351">We don't know what these figures mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.455" offset="18945233">They're just averages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.476" offset="18953279">And on some of the tables that are offered, the number of cars on the appellant's own railroad had been omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.644" offset="18998000">So we -- we contend that these figures do not sustain their burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.344" offset="19024750">And assuming that they would have a basis, a legal basis for allocating these cars outside Pennsylvania, they can't sustain that burden by showing that they're on some other railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.562" offset="19081592">It seems to me that they should have the same burden to show us that they're taxable in California, let's say, as California would have to show their court that they are taxable there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.430" offset="19125060">Taxable situs to me means enough of a situs to enable the -- some State to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.047" offset="19151600">All these figures show is that a certain average number of car days were spent on -- on 345 different railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.522" offset="19189426">There's nothing fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.049" offset="19195591">There's no -- no such thing as fixed routes here because a shipment might go out one day to California and there may not be anymore for -- for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.221" offset="19236237">There's no regularity here of anything except the regularity of the application of the car hire agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.570" offset="19269674">Speaking briefly about our lack of equal protection, as Your Honors probably recall, there are different kinds of railroads, there are some that have multiple domiciles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.119" offset="19339891">There are four or five operating in Pennsylvania in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.680" offset="19358072">And as to them of course, we -- we give a complete allocation by miles -- by miles in Pennsylvania over total miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.076" offset="19399659">We have to because that's in accordance with our concept that the domicile is the place where the tax situs rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.759" offset="19434454">There are some railroads, however, that are domicile in Pennsylvania that have tracks outside of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.008" offset="19463398">And it's true that for this year 1951, there -- in some of those cases, there were freight cars off the system, you might say, which did -- which did not get allocated 100% in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.416" offset="19525047">Now, as to those railroads, this -- this failure to make this allocation was due to the fact that they were reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.007" offset="19563395">There was no distinction made in the reporting of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.446" offset="19577187">And if there was any discrimination, which we don't believe there was, but if there was any, it was because of the imperfect knowledge of the taxing officers and not because of any policy which -- which discriminated against the -- the -- this railroad and in favor of other railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.522" offset="19653465">We were not in a position to give this railroad an allocation because it has no tracks outside Pennsylvania and we think that we've satisfied the Equal Protection Clause in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.036" offset="19707486">Let me close by summarizing in saying that we think that the Central Railroad case controls this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.199" offset="19744162">We think it's still good law as it applies to meandering freight cars and that the alternative to our position convey the taxation of railroads like this in 48 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.284" offset="19808528">A thing which I don't believe the railroads would really appreciate because well, their -- well, their taxes might not go up much.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.267" offset="19840397">They would be subject to a very unfavorable tax situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.950" offset="19863176">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="4945.651" offset="19885955">I would -- I would like to make two points briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.305" offset="19908629">Justice -- Mr. Justice Harlan asked Mr. Keitel about the freight cars that ran on fixed routes and regular schedules over the lines of appellant in Pennsylvania in Central of -- of Railroad in New Jersey in New Jersey's.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.878" offset="19978846">And Mr. Keitel lacks the point that those cars were not used in Central's -- appellant's business while they're in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.010" offset="20015417">I don't think that makes any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.695" offset="20026180">They were run on fixed routes and regular schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.364" offset="20040808">The power to levy a property tax is based upon physical presence of that property and habitual employment of it within the taxing State, whether that employment is by the owner or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.098" offset="20123773">Now, certainly, in this particular case, these freight cars that were run on fixed routes and regular schedules were employed in New Jersey regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.976" offset="20175287">I would like to devote the rest of the time to try and to place the decision of this Court in New York Central and the Hudson River Railroad Company versus Miller in its proper perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.433" offset="20233070">The state court and the appellee, in this case, disregard -- just turn out by disregarding two vitally stipulated facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.671" offset="20274030">First, that the cars were run on routes -- in fixed routes and regular schedules under the operating agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.038" offset="20303496">Two, under the rental agreement, they were run habitually, regularly and continuously.</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.942" offset="20323140">Then they -- they start out by applying these descriptive terms to both the movement of appellant's cars under both uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.190" offset="20368175">The state court said indiscriminate interchange with other railroads and absence of fixed routes and regular schedules, the -- the appellee describes the movement as abs -- temporary absence from the domiciliary State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.391" offset="20448946">But on the basis of those descriptive terms applied in this case, they considered that the decision of this Court in the New York Central and Hudson River case apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.308" offset="20500564">Now, in that case, it is very clear that this Court considered the movement of the cars to be so sporadic and irregular that they came to the conclusion that the cars did not obtain a situs in the other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.752" offset="20586350">And for that reason, they sustained the -- the unapportioned property tax levied by the domiciliary State.</text>

            <text syncTime="5366.733" offset="21570330">Now, the -- the State has made another point also that it has referred to a Kentucky case decided in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.152" offset="21612022">And the -- the counsel for the Commonwealth has said that the appellant hasn't come up with any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5384.062" offset="21639607">Well, I -- I do have a case and I have cited it in my brief, decided by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in 1959, whereas this Kentucky case was decided in 1926, the Oklahoma Supreme Court had before it the problem of whether or not tank cars had a situs in Oklahoma from which income was earned that was subject to tax by Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.418" offset="21764995">Well, the owner of the tank cars was a non-resident and leased these tank cars to railroads who in turn leased them to shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5425.960" offset="21807208">And Oklahoma levy the incomes tax against the owner, the owner protested on the ground, “Why -- why I never used those cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5435.136" offset="21843884">I wasn't doing business in -- in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.919" offset="21855065">The railroad, I leased them to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.137" offset="21863946">He leased them to shippers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.720" offset="21874291">And the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that “Even though you're not doing business in Oklahoma, an average number of your tank cars had a situs there from which you derived income which is subject to the state tax.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.996" offset="21931342">So the point of that case is that you can have situs of property, an owner can have situs of property apart from his dom -- domicile from which he derives income and his tax revolve in that State where his property is located from which he receives income.</text>
