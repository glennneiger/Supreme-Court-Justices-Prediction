            <label>Mr. I. Henry Kutz</label>
            <text syncTime="3.662" offset="118053">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.624" offset="137906">On March 21, 1955, the taxpayer delivered the 500 shares of du Pont stock, which he -- a little early, he was supposed to deliver it on April 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.183" offset="208123">His cost basis for the stock was $74,775 in market value, at the time of transfer was $82,250.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.259" offset="272384">The Commissioner determined that he had realized the gain between the cost basis and the market value, with the date of transfer and has held that this gain was in the amount of about $7500.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.820" offset="366634">The court below did not rule that the transfer was not a taxable event, but relieved the husband from liability only because it felt unable to measure the amount of the taxable gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.722" offset="454301">That is the value of the discharge of his marital obligations, a consideration which he received for the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.197" offset="496201">I should like, however, to discuss because it discussed in taxpayer's brief and we have discussed it in our brief whether this transfer was a taxable event.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.799" offset="562552">The pertinent statutory provisions have been in the revenue laws for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.328" offset="596720">They're the ones that -- familiar ones that deal with the gain on -- or loss on disposition of property in the 1954 code which governs here, Section 1001 (a) provides, that the gain from the sale or other disposition of property shall be the excess of the amount realized there from over the adjusted basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.096" offset="707793">In subsection b, the statute defines what the amount realized as.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.487" offset="737364">The amount realized from the sale or other disposition of property shall be the sum of any money received plus the fair market value of the property other than money received.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.413" offset="800998">Now, we say that it's our contention and that is the sale or other dispos -- disposition of this du Pont stock, in exchange for the discharge of the marital obligations owed by taxpayer to his wife, was a discharge of a legal obligation that it's the familiar situation, where taxes have often -- have been assessed without any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.349" offset="940805">That the satisfaction of a legal obligation, that is a discharge of a debt is a receipt to the obligor.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.063" offset="979675">And here, he used property which had appreciated in value great -- to some extent during his period of ownership and he used it, we say at its market value, he is therefore liable for the difference between the basis and the value of the stock at the time of transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.440" offset="1101093">It's the same as if he had sold the stock and used the proceeds to pay the debt, that he goes through the form of selling a stock that doesn't go through the form of the selling of stock, doesn't take away from his realization of economic gains who increased in market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.862" offset="1182804">In the earlier cases decided by the Third and the Second Circuits in 1941 and 1942, this was the holding, and in those cases in the Third Circuit case, the Mesta case, the taxpayer transferred to his wife a stock that it cost him $7500, and at the time of the transfer, it was worth $156,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.800" offset="1314565">In the Halliwell case, the Second Circuit case, he transferred stock that it cost a $160,000 and the market value was $461,000.</text>

            <label>Mr. I. Henry Kutz</label>
            <text syncTime="320.370" offset="1384887">Yes, Your Honor, they both were marital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.871" offset="1394813">They both were cases where in this charge of the husband's marital obligations, he transferred appreciated property.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.571" offset="1441625">There was -- the cases were hard fought.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.076" offset="1459702">The -- in the -- both cases represented reversals of the Board of Tax Appeals and in the Mesta case, the Third Circuit said en banc and there were -- it was a three to two decision, but they have been the law since 1941 and when the Mesta case was decided and the first questioning of them in long -- in the period of about 20 years from that time to this was in the Sixth Circuit, in the Marshman case, decided in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.637" offset="1621870">Although, that case actually didn't go on that ground, there was reasoning in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.663" offset="1649977">The case -- the Marshman case went on the ground that the market value of the security there in option couldn't be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.491" offset="1705357">Now, taxpayer argues that this wasn't a taxable event.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.346" offset="1732733">There were two possible categories other than sale or exchange that this might fall into.One is, that it was a division of property of a -- between the spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.090" offset="1799711">But that we say is not the fact under the state of the law of Delaware, and it wasn't then the Halliwell case, the Second Circuit case, discussed that same thing under the similar common-law rules of the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.561" offset="1885602">There was nothing that could have prevented Mr. Davis from selling his stock at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.448" offset="1913187">His wife had no share in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.541" offset="1921546">It wasn't -- as if she had some interest in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.911" offset="1938996">It wasn't a division of property at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.022" offset="1951431">She had -- she had claims against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.418" offset="1965014">And although, the claims would differ on -- depended upon his ability to pay, I'm thinking of alimony, that is none unusual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.618" offset="2025827">It was a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.799" offset="2034604">It was his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.809" offset="2042650">He used that to discharge the claim against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.041" offset="2063548">Now, another possible category that was suggested below by taxpayer, but is not suggested in his brief here is that he was making a gift to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.794" offset="2126555">But this seems completely contrary to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.091" offset="2159783">There was no act of generosity.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.561" offset="2169605">They bargained very closely, and he got consideration for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.240" offset="2204296">As I say, taxpayer has not advanced that ground in his (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="528.601" offset="2217775">Precisely the same result would follow where this denominated as a gift or working on, made it as a division of property, wouldn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="538.421" offset="2257063">So far as it goes as the -- the wife's subsequent basis were concerned and all other tax, was it?</text>

          <turn speaker="i_henry_kutz" startTime="542.751" stopTime="712.684">
            <label>Mr. I. Henry Kutz</label>
            <text syncTime="542.751" offset="2274408">That's a -- that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.803" offset="2282559">Now, at corollary of the holding here will be the wife's basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.144" offset="2307950">Now, it also seems to us, unrealistic to suppose that she expected she was going to get her husband's lower basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.263" offset="2360404">And -- so that when she sold the stock, she'd have to pay the tax which he would normally have paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.076" offset="2391646">And I've -- I stated I believe a -- if the Court will recall in stating the terms, the agreement, she was to get it free and clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.747" offset="2454340">Well of course, that wouldn't prevent it from being free and clear, but I think like in the Mesta case, would have been very much surprised if she found that there's $150,000 worth of -- of stock that she received, she had a cost basis of $7500.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.762" offset="2542425">And here, although the difference -- the economic gain is not as great, I think it is normal and fairer and -- and the more accurate construction of the agreement of the parties to assume that she took it at the basis which is -- of his -- of its market value at the time of the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.851" offset="2642735">Now -- and also an important consideration is that this has been a law for approximately 20 years that undoubtedly many marital agreements have been made based on the Mesta and Halliwell principle which our leading cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.367" offset="2728835">Taxpayer says that the effect of -- of the decision that the husband is taxable will create a difference between community property and common-law states and that's a bad thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.832" offset="2798738">But the tax laws for long have had the deal with that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.458" offset="2829249">It exists under the law, the separate states.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.931" offset="2847117">Congress has amended the tax laws when it's thought wise to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.823" offset="2870627">This rule has existed for many years and the court -- the courts must deal with the property law of the states as it finds them.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.148" offset="2923917">And it's to be assumed that the party's contract knowing what the property law of the states are.</text>

            <text syncTime="766.584" offset="3169677">Also, if I may add this to my answer Mr. Justice Harlan, the Second Circuit in the case called Farid-Es-Sultaneh and the Third -- and the Fourth Circuit have been at the case called Commissioner against Patino, in Farid-Es-Sultaneh, there was a transfer made prior to marriage and in release of marital rights antenuptial.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.008" offset="3303424">And in Patino, it was during marriage and the question was the basis of the wife and in order to determine the basis of the wife, they really had to decide this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.190" offset="3352116">They both held that she got the market value with the ba -- basis at the time of the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.401" offset="3384926">Now, the question -- the second issue in the case is how is this property to be valued?</text>
            <text syncTime="835.628" offset="3445844">He gets his consideration as a discharge of marital rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.773" offset="3474474">Now, the -- the -- the Third Circuit stated in the Mesta case that it would be assumed that the parties would get their moneys worth, that if he was willing to transfer this appreciated stock and he could have easily sold it and given her the money instead for the discharge of marital rights that he considered he was getting his money's worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.855" offset="3618774">The Court of Claims in the Sixth Circuit felt that the marital rights value could not be estimated.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.744" offset="3670392">They went on the ground that it was impossible to ascertain what he received here.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.660" offset="3702053">They said that tension and emotion enter into marital transactions and that would prevent an equality of value or transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.832" offset="3762657">But tension and emotion certainly under into many transactions, and if we would try to find that a result which is unjust, we would say we will make no decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.522" offset="3829426">There's nothing to prevent the taxpayer if these values are not equal from -- from introducing evidence to show that they are unequal.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.291" offset="3888567">But presumably, in absence of any evidence, it's fair to assume and a more reasonable rule and one which would protect the wife from having the husband's basis to say that these are equality of exchanges.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.695" offset="4050108">There was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.773" offset="4066513">Now, for the first time in his brief here, counsel has made two contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.351" offset="4112802">These contentions were not made in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.440" offset="4125132">They weren't made in the brief submitted in opposition of petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.371" offset="4148851">They first appear here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.571" offset="4157628">One of them is that the date on which the value of the husband's marital obligation should be -- on which they should be valued is that -- is the November 1954 date on which the -- at which the agreement was signed and not the March 1955 date when the property was transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.327" offset="4276642">He says, “If you take the November 1954 date, you will find that at that time, the market value of the stock was below his basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.751" offset="4342366">And there's -- they -- he for the first time in search in the record the -- or in his briefs states what the market value where the stock in November 1954 was though that is of course a matter of -- that one can find out by looking at the reports of the stock market, and we do not dispute the value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.621" offset="4449886">But the reason I mentioned that is to show how this is the first time that it comes into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.387" offset="4496906">It seems to us that it was the intention of the parties to make their adjustment of values at the time of the transfer in March when there was an accretion in value and appreciation in value in the husband's stock, not the date of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.702" offset="4582170">And this was the date that was also taken in the Mesta and Halliwell cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.315" offset="4616652">It was the date of the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.926" offset="4623026">No issue was raised in those cases on that point but the Court took the date of the transfer in agreements often the date of the transfers what counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.696" offset="4674121">You may have a stock of a corporation, a close corporation exchanged for marketable stock, an agreement to that effect and the agreement provides in several months later, the exchange shall be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.577" offset="4749667">And it's necessary to have stockholder's consents and director's consents in many other formalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.122" offset="4783835">And the parties always expect that the exchange of values when the close corporation stock may not be possible to value at all, except in relation to the market value, the exchange and always the time of transfer is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.231" offset="4864293">Another point that he makes is that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1214.154" offset="4960005">And in that connection, he makes a second point which is that the consideration was not received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.345" offset="5000756">That is a consideration of discharge as marital rights was not received by the husband till 1956 when the whole thousand shares was delivered or perhaps 1964 when the alimony payments where to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.368" offset="5068884">But we say that our -- it's our position that -- and this is also a point that he first makes here, it's our position that consideration was received pro-rata.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.803" offset="5558627">The Court of Claims had before it in this case two distinct classes of legal fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.516" offset="5605439">One class was legal fees which were paid by the husband both to his -- his own attorney and to his wife's attorney for services rendered in the negotiation and preparation of the properties settlement agreement and other documents and transfers in connection therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.091" offset="5687777">The other set of legal fees were fees paid by the husband both to his attorney and to his wife's attorney for services rendered by them in furnishing advice as to the tax consequences of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.501" offset="5769383">The Court of Claims found as to the latter that each attorney was rendering services for his own client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.735" offset="5806268">This again, emphasizing the advisory character of the divorce proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.454" offset="5837197">And that the husband was, therefore, not entitled to deduct the fee pay to his wife -- to his wife's attorney on account of advice for tax counsel which he had received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.155" offset="5912012">On the other hand, the Court of Claims held that the husband was entitled to deduct that portion of the fee paid to his own attorney which was allocable to tax advice which he had received from his own attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.919" offset="5999052">The statutory provision upon which the Court of Claims relied is a different subsection of Section 212 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code then the subsections which were involved in the Gilmore and Patrick cases in which the Court heard this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.517" offset="6089435">In the previous cases, the subsections involved were one and two of Section 212.</text>

            <text syncTime="1729.279" offset="7020440">The Court will note that the italicized words in the Committee reports speak of contest over tax matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.031" offset="7123466">The words used in Section 212 (3), we think were used with very careful deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.128" offset="7167875">The word “determination” for example is a word with very precise meaning and its very origin, the word “determination” implies the coming to a final decision whether it'd be the final decision itself or the process of arriving at a final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.719" offset="7262229">And under the well-accepted principle of noscitur a sociis we feel that the word “determination” here taken in the context of collection or refund indicates that Congress intended that this word be used in a very narrow sense and not in the sense of a mere prediction or forecast or advice of a preliminary characteristic to the possible tax consequences of some transaction which either has not yet been entered into or is in the process of being entered into but not yet consummated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.912" offset="8251016">Now, in our system of taxation, the preparation of a tax return certainly in -- of a federal context is a determination unlike the British system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.242" offset="8308381">In the British system, the taxpayer merely reports the amount of his income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.126" offset="8327920">The assessment is made at some subsequent date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.877" offset="8346833">In our system, the taxpayer assesses himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.764" offset="8362402">He computes his tax and he pays it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.230" offset="8376299">And in most instances, certainly in many instances, this is the last act with respect to the determination of his tax for that particular period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.978" offset="8423320">It maybe post-order that it may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.445" offset="8433142">It may go into the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.193" offset="8440142">It may merely result in an entry of the item on an assessment list which is automatically recorded and goes into the files.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.967" offset="8475251">The preparation of the return in and of itself can be in -- and many cases is the final act of determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.109" offset="8519764">And so we believe that it was proper for the Commissioner to say that the word “determination” in the context of the American tax system includes the preparation of a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.297" offset="8576606">Now, there is further language in the regulation which seems to have puzzled the Court of Claims somewhat and that is the reference to expenses for tax counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.046" offset="8635538">These words we feel must be taken within the context of the balance of the regulation and certainly within the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.370" offset="8680887">If they are to any extent ambiguous, I believe that it is certainly proper to refer to the statute in interpreting the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.398" offset="8721011">And the statute itself and its history are quite clear in indicating that in matters relating to non-income tax determinations, only those counsel fees which relate to the preparation of the return, a determination in the nature of a dispute, the refund of tax or the collection of tax can be deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.876" offset="8862908">We emphasize this because --</text>

            <text syncTime="2212.199" offset="8952142">I should like to distinguish between the income tax situation and the any tax other than income tax situation in answering this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.144" offset="8999999">It has been clear for many years and certainly was clear at the time of the adaption of the 1954 Revenue Code and the insertion of 212 (3) into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.795" offset="9058513">That advice received in connection with income tax matters whether it'd be in advance of a projected transaction, whether it'd be of an investment character that all such advice was deductible provided that it met the provisions of Section 23 (a) (2) or now 212 (1) and (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.428" offset="9173034">In other words, if these were expenses for the production or collection of income or for the management, conservation or maintenance of property held for the production of income, these expenses were deductible irrespective of whether the tax advice was received in connection with a consummated transaction or a transaction which was contemplated or one which might never be entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.216" offset="9292257">However, the Lykes case did not deal with an income tax matter at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.300" offset="9312528">The Lykes case dealt with a gift tax deficiency and held that legal fees incurred in disputing a gift tax deficiency were personal in character and non-deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.773" offset="9362474">As the one now reads, the express holding of the Lykes case has been overruled by 212 (3) because the legal fees there involved would now be expressly deductible under subsection 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.544" offset="9437497">This is not to say, however, that it was the intention of Congress and we certainly deny that it was the intention of Congress to say that it was the purpose of 212 (3) to expand as to non-income tax matters, all sorts of expenses which might be incurred in other than the particular situations which are set out to a determination, collection or refund of any tax so that in the present case, we have two problems which emanate from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.239" offset="9616280">First, it is not clear from the facts to what extent these fees were paid for income tax advice or for advice with regard to other taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.644" offset="9665912">The finding of the Court of Claims which is at page 121 of -- of the record finding number 20, there is no testimony or evidence in this case from which it can be -- can be determined the extent to which the attorney's fees paid by Mr. Davis either to Mr. Young, his own attorney or to Mr. Morford, his wife's attorney were reasonably allocable to the effort of Mr. Davis to retain his shares of du Pont and there -- thereby to preserve his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.903" offset="9846993">And then on page 119 and going over to page 120, it is expressly stated that the Court was unable to determine to what extent these services related to income tax or the gift tax matters but that there was a merging of both income and gift tax advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.783" offset="10010520">But we do not feel that even had there been any clear-cut allocation of the fee as between income tax advice or gift tax advice that even the income tax advice would be deductible for we say, and I'm speaking now of the husband, the husband's tax advice for we say that this was clearly personal to the same extent as the other fees paid in the divorce proceeding were personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.768" offset="10178435">As to the fees which may have been paid for gift tax advice, we, again, say that the fees paid were personal and we also say that it was not the intention of Congress in enacting 212 (3) to permit the deduction of legal fees incurred in estate planning, that is for the preparation of inter vivos trust for the preparation of wills even though in their preparation, a considerable amount of thought was given to the possible gift tax consequences or to the possible estate tax consequences of such preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.397" offset="10424926">There is a narrower ground upon which the decision below can be affirmed and that is the one upon which the Court of Claims decided that the husband was not entitled to a deduction on account of the fees paid to his wife's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.220" offset="10520221">This Court has many times held that a deduction belongs only to the person whose affairs gave rise to it, that a deduction cannot by contract or by any other legally binding arrangement be transferred from one taxpayer to another so that the transferee of the deduction maybe permitted to take it just as the transferor of the deduction may have been able to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2723.750" offset="10998366">But now you're turning and you say alternatively, this case can be decided on a narrower point as I understand it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2739.592" offset="11061791">The suggestion is made in taxpayer's brief as a matter of fact that these were necessaries that the husband was obligated to protect his wife and supply such funds necessary to provide her with legal counsel when she needed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.522" offset="11137442">This, I think suggests the -- the very answer because as to the wife, possibly, possibly although we deny it, she might be entitled to a deduction on account of tax advice which she receives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.806" offset="11206614">But when the husband pays this, he is not paying a fee or an expense which is related in any sense to his business affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.463" offset="11269204">He's paying something which is imposed upon him because of the marriage contract just as in Interstate Transit Lines against Commissioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.330" offset="11448717">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.202" offset="11468152">Mr. Kutz in his argument quoted the statutory provision which bears on this matter of the realization of gain by husband in connection with the transfer property to his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.769" offset="11526457">And the risk of repetition, I like to restate those statutory provisions because I think they're all important in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.966" offset="11567208">Section 1001 of the Code provides that gain from the sale or other disposition of the property shall be the excess of amount realized there from over the adjusted basis for the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.964" offset="11627186">Statute goes on to provide that the amount realized from the sale or other disposition of property shall be the sum of any money received plus the fair market value of the property other than money received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.098" offset="11691760">On a statutory conglomeration such as the Internal Revenue Code which is replete with complex provisions I point this out as a provision which is remarkably simple and clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.784" offset="11746513">I can understand this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.663" offset="11761977">There seems to be no dispute about the fact that the transaction by which Mr. Davis transferred property to his wife is du Pont stock would not, under common understanding of the word, be considered a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.018" offset="11823417">Also that doesn't seem to be any question about the proposition that what Mr. Davis received in exchange for this du Pont stock was not money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.115" offset="11863855">And that means if there are only two inquiries here which most of which must be answered affirmatively before the Court of Claims can be reverse on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.552" offset="11909622">And those two inquires are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.607" offset="11921847">First, was Mr. Davis' transfer of du Pont stock to his wife a disposition, as that word use in the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.746" offset="11962389">And secondly, assuming an affirmative answer to the first was the fair market value of what Mr. Davis received an amount in excess of his basis for the property he transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.018" offset="12019440">Now, I submit that either of those questions must be answered in the negative then the Court of Claims must be affirmed on this point, otherwise, the statutory provision hasn't been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.908" offset="12070954">Now, the word “disposition” in the statute has never been construed to encompass all transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.491" offset="12101360">It's obviously possible to read it -- it's meaning any transfer is a disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.842" offset="12126751">Now, the Government itself conceives in its brief that there are many types of transfers which do not constitute taxable dispositions and the Government's quite candid in pointing out this analo -- somewhat analogous situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.668" offset="12190072">Example of those would be transfers in connections with division of partnership property or transfers in connection with distributions of shares of estates or trust transfers in connection with in kind corporate distributions to stockholders, transfers in connection with marital separations of couples residing in community property states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.773" offset="12290487">Further, the Government has never contended so far as I can determine that there is any taxable disposition for purposes of the Internal Revenue laws in such common place transfers as gifts or transfers of appreciated property to a charitable organization or a transformation of property from a descendant to his heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.811" offset="12382647">Since not all dispositions, not all transfers rather, qualify as taxable dispositions, it must be the position of the Government that the word “disposition” has a narrower meaning than the word “transfer” for purpose of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3095.776" offset="12486510">And I submit that to make sense out of the statute, we have to accept the definition of disposition which seems to be either implicitly or explicitly assumed by everyone who has handled cases in this area and that is the somewhat art -- inartistic definition of disposition as meaning a transfer like a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.017" offset="12587447">Using that definition of disposition, we come to this inquiry in this particular case and that is was Mr. Davis' transfer of du Pont stock to his wife a part of a transaction which was like a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.685" offset="12658082">Now, the Government has done a good job in its brief of narrowing the issue down considerably in this case and it's done it by making a very candid concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.650" offset="12697997">The Government said in its original brief that as an original matter, this inquiry could have been answered either way that indicates if the Government believes that if this was a new issue, an answer either way would be reasonable and if you were the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.488" offset="12785351">I'm not ready to make a light concession but I'm ready to proceed on the assumption that the Government meant what they said in that concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.163" offset="12824012">The Government then goes on from that concession and analyzed a certain considerations which had asked the Court to take into account in deciding this case and concludes here I'm quoting, “Other considerations being inconclusive, the factor which should be determined have been favor reversing the Court of Claims is the force of precedent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.637" offset="12925889">Now, the Government submits two principle Circuit Court decisions as exerting this force of precedent in its direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.799" offset="12962565">Those are the Mesta and the Halliwell cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.079" offset="12979702">Now, since these are the principle cases in which the Government relies for the one factor which it says -- (Inaudible) this case towards its side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.494" offset="13013347">I think it's worth analyzing those cases in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.876" offset="13038843">In Mesta, the husband taxpayer agreed to deliver stock to his wife and I'm quoting, “In full settlement and satisfaction of all claims and demands on the part of Mrs. Mesta for her maintenance and support”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.223" offset="13104253">Now, it's true that the agreement also resided that the transfer was in lieu of all marital rights of the wife and the husband's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.351" offset="13148766">The Board of Tax Appeals decided that the husband did not realize a taxable gain on account of his transfer of stock to his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.036" offset="13191502">But the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed disposition but in its opinion noted only that the transfer was in settlement and satisfaction of the wife's claim for alimony and support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.204" offset="13248240">As a matter of fact, the Board of Tax Appeals in its opinion stated that the Government's argument in Mesta was on the basis that the transfer was in discharge of the husband's support obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.941" offset="13339146">In Halliwell case, the parties attached to their separation agreement a schedule listing certain securities where agreed values attributed to each and a cash adjustment figure to bring the total of the property transferred to the wife, the $462,561.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.927" offset="13431097">This indicates to me that the parties in the Halliwell case had arrived in an understanding that the husband would transfer a specific dollar amount to the wife and then had set about finding securities which the husband could transfer to her in satisfaction of that specific amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.434" offset="13521063">As in the Mesta case, the Court of Appeals would reverse the Board of Tax Appeals and help for the Government noted in its opinion that the transfer was in discharge of a support obligation and also in discharge of the husband's obligations to support a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.758" offset="13606431">In the Halliwell case, it's true as the Government points out that the wife also executed a release of her rights to share in her husband's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.839" offset="13642689">But the Court of Appeals in Halliwell did not refer to this as a consideration for the transfer of the securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.531" offset="13677484">Again, as in the Mesta case, the agreement did not refer to the transfer as being a part of a division of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.264" offset="13712384">Now, those are the two cases, which the Government says are precedence for deciding the T.C. Davis case on the basis of holding that he realized gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.618" offset="13757837">In the Davis case, the agreement which is set forth in full in the record is quite explicit to the effect of the transfer of stock was part of a division of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.166" offset="13812067">Entirely separate provisions were made in the agreement for satisfaction of Mr. Davis' obligation to support his wife and his minor child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.598" offset="13853759">For that reason, we submit that the Mesta and Halliwell cases, both of which involve transfers and discharge of a support obligation, are not at all in point for the Davis case which involved a transfer and division of property and the agreement is clear on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.612" offset="14129821">I'll spell that out for you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.149" offset="14143927">The du Pont stock, which was transferred to Mrs. Davis in this case, was clearly prop -- property which was titled in Mr. Davis' name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.749" offset="14182379">There's no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.474" offset="14189275">The stock on the books of the du Pont Company is registered in the name of T.C. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.563" offset="14209651">But the point of this is that there was another property involved in this agreement, other properties besides from the du Pont stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.607" offset="14245804">The agreement points out that the wife among other things agreed to transfer to the husband certain insurance policies on his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.721" offset="14278301">I'm not contending that the du Pont stock is jointly owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.273" offset="14292511">I'm saying that it was part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.976" offset="14299303">Its transfer was part of an overall division of the property of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.553" offset="14321560">These include their household furnishing, other insurance policies, the residence in they live.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.868" offset="14342875">All that have to be straightened out and that's what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.723" offset="14354265">And as a part of that, the husband transferred du Pont stock to his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.902" offset="14370983">Then entirely as part from that and another part of the agreement, they made provision for the discharge of the support and alimony obligation of the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.752" offset="14414346">Mr. Kutz in his argument said that there was -- there would have to be evidence in the record in cases of this sort as to the value of the wife's right to support an alimony and if there was no evidence of that kind in this case other than the evidence of the value of the stock of the du Pont Company and I submit that the agreement itself furnishes evidence of what the parties had agreed was the consideration and therefore apparently, the value in the Government's view of this support, an alimony obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.421" offset="14565021">Now, the Government in its brief points to paragraph 13 of the agreement and that appears on page 97 of the record and says that that paragraph indicates as the Government puts it that a division of property as a legal misnomer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.723" offset="14642239">I think what they're trying to say is, and they're sparing my fillings apparently by putting in terms of a legal misnomer, they're trying to say that they don't believe this that this was in fact a division of property but certainly paragraph 13 does not support the argument that this was not a division of property because all paragraph 13 does is to wrap up the whole agreement and have both sides agree that the whole agreement is to be a final combination of their respect of obligations to each other as to alimony or support or any property interest they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.811" offset="14814647">Now, there's an important issue of the facts in this case which is raised in the Government's reply brief but not in its main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.665" offset="14854040">In the Government's main brief they state that all of the property involve in the settlement negotiations were owned by Mr. Davis and that's an accurate statement and that's what the Court of Claims found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.347" offset="14920808">In the replied brief, the Government says that all of the property involved in the agreement was owned by Mr. Davis and that is not what the Court of Claims found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.231" offset="14988309">And to appreciate the difference in those words, the Court must remember that in the Court of Claims, we were also arguing about the deduction of counsel fees to protect Mr. Davis' interest in the du Pont Company and that it was page after page of testimony about the lawyer's negotiating with respect to this du Pont stock, and it was at that point that the Court of Claims noted that the du Pont stock was owned by Mr. Davis and that was the subject of the negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.614" offset="15125817">But the record itself shows that there was other property involved in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.716" offset="15162284">Now, we submit to the Court that if there's any force of precedent work in this case, it's a work on the side of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.502" offset="15201364">We submit that the cases involving situations varying a very close analogy to the Davis case have been uniformly decided by determinations that the transfers do not constitute taxable dispositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.757" offset="15258415">I've already mentioned some of those are distributions of shares of estate or trust, those are not considered taxable dispositions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3821.226" offset="15388296">In that situation, there's no statutory provision that covers this, nonetheless, as a matter of such thing as tax common-law, a tax common-law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.970" offset="15427271">There is no taxable disposition found in that situation, neither is there a taxable disposition on division of partnership property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.478" offset="15465305">Now, it seems to me that if a business partnership breaks up and men who are dealing with each other as businessmen and decide to break apart and conduct their businesses separately, if they have no gain when one takes one part of their partnership property and another one takes another part of partnership property, I failed to see how in a completely non-business transaction such as a marriage and a divorce, the parties can have a taxable gain when they do the same thing that a business partnership does without any realization to gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.939" offset="15615143">The same thing is true in breaking up a corporate relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.256" offset="15632384">The Government doesn't contend that when a corporation is dissolved, the corporation realizes any gain when it transfers the property of the corporations in kind, in liquidation and the same thing is true of divisions of community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.867" offset="15694869">The Government seems to recognize that the deci -- decision holding Mr. Davis has a taxable gain here would create a divergence of tax treatment as between common-law and community property law jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.055" offset="15755577">And as I understand the Government's position, it makes still attempt to say that that's a desirable state of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.889" offset="15782954">The Government's answer seems to be instead that if there's a divergence of treatment, this is a matter of this just inherent in the differences between community property and common-law property jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.678" offset="15842095">The Government also suggests that if there's to be a cure for this divergence, the cure should come from Congress and not from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.607" offset="15877831">If I was arguing here today in the face of a statute which said that there must be a gain in the situation such as Mr. Davis' or if there were precedents in this Court which required that result then I would think that the Government's answer on this community property problem would be worthy of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.333" offset="15964662">In that case obviously, the jury relies with Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.772" offset="15982425">But in this case, the Government itself concedes that the Court could reasonably decide this as an original proposition either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.475" offset="16013249">And I submit that if that is the fact, the Court could decide either way then its wise policy to decide this case on a basis which would give us a uniform system of taxation rather than a divergence system of taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4052.741" offset="16314284">Now, I've assumed so far in my argument that Mesta and Halliwell are first not applicable here because they involved transfers and discharge of a support obligation whereas Mr. Davis' transfer was part of a division of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.640" offset="16373948">That I'm not ready at this point to assume that Mesta and Halliwell do apply in this case and that their reasoning applies and that means if you accept the reasoning of Mesta and Halliwell, you must conclude that the husband engaged in a taxable transaction and then moved over and find out whether he had a gain or a loss on the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.133" offset="16479901">Now, on Mesta, the Court of Appeals was faced with the problem of once having decided if there was taxable disposition, how do you measure the amount moving to the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.969" offset="16519293">Obviously, a man doesn't buy -- divesting himself for property alone gain income, he gains income by having something moved towards him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.787" offset="16558477">And the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Mesta met that problem very neatly by saying that they would assume that a man who gives property of a fixed value must be getting his money's worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.158" offset="16611976">Well, that's a very broad assumption particularly in marital situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.711" offset="16638203">But let's assume for the moment that that is the correct way to analyze this and that that is the correct way to measure the gain moving to the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.170" offset="16676028">Now, if that's the fact then we must assume that when Mr. Davis negotiated with Mrs.Davis, he placed a value on the rights which were going to move to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.837" offset="16730676">And he placed, using the Mesta reasoning again, he placed the value of exactly the same dollar amount as the value of what he was going to transfer to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.191" offset="16772159">Now, Mr. Davis even though he was the Vice President of the du Pont Company in 1954 didn't, so far as I know and so far as the record shows, know in November of 1954 what is going to be the value of the du Pont stock in March of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.886" offset="16834957">So we can assume that if Mesta is right that the husband got his money's worth and was negotiating in terms of what the value was or what he was going to transfer, he must have been reasoning in terms of the value on the date he made the agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.909" offset="16899009">And the Court, I believe, can take judicial notice of the stock quotations in the Wall Street Journal that day and the value of the du Pont stock that Mr. Davis transferred on that date had a basis, had a -- was less than Mr. Davis' basis for the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.250" offset="16980407">Now, the Government answers these arguments about the wrong value and the wrong year without seem to meet them head-on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.262" offset="17012381">The first answer the Government gave in its replied brief as to why the date of agreement value would not work was to say that using that date as the critical date for fixing value would result in a rule which would be difficult to please.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.940" offset="17087091">Now, I construe that argument in saying no more than if you take Mesta and apply it reasonably and logically, you reach a point where it's difficult to hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.925" offset="17131081">Therefore, you take Mesta, you adopt its rule but you don't apply its reasoning logically to the conclusion to which it obviously points, you'll apply it in a new logical and unreasonable way so as to reach the result which is easy to please.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.506" offset="17201403">The Government's second argument about the wrong value and wrong year matter is to state that in Mesta and Halliwell, the date of delivery value rather the date of agreement value was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.012" offset="17251453">The opinion of the Board of Tax Appeals in Mesta shows that the so-called “value” used to determine the gain was merely a figure agreed upon by the husband and wife as part of the negotiations.Also in that case, it should be noted that the transfer actually occurred only four days after the date in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.670" offset="17358033">On Halliwell case, the values used for measuring the gain are later recited by the Court of Appeals to have been the date of delivery values which was July 16, 1938 where in fact the values described in the securities by the parties in an agreement executed on March 16, 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="4337.157" offset="17451969">The date of delivery in the Halliwell case was just four months after the agreement date.</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.950" offset="17475166">In Halliwell, the transfer securities consisted of stock of ten corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.031" offset="17499512">When it's noted that eight of those stocks were publicly traded, it passes my understanding how on July 16, 1938, those stocks can have a value, a fair market value to the penny equal to their value on March 16, 1938 when the parties signed the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.418" offset="17597001">Government's next answer to this major value question is to state that the Commissioner's use of the date of delivery was not contested by the taxpayers in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.062" offset="17639633">That's quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4386.169" offset="17648097">That we contend that where we have objected to the fundamental error of the Commissioner, namely the error of saying that we had a taxable disposition here, it's not necessary for us to object to every subsidiary error which is associated with that principle errors.</text>

            <text syncTime="4434.314" offset="17840671">The last answer the Government has about this major value question is to analogize to the situation where a person takes property with a known value, we'll assume it's known because it's stock of a listed corporation where you can check the newspaper quotations and exchanges that for stock of a corporation in which is difficult to determine the market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.738" offset="17950281">Let's assume for cycle illustration that the stock we're talking about is a million dollars worth of du Pont stock which is transferred by a du Pont stockholder to the XYZ Corporation in a taxable transaction and the du Pont stockholder gets back all of the stock of the XYZ Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.755" offset="18034395">Now, the first place of this analogy falls down is that in that situation, we're not talking about taxing the transferor on the value of a release of rights in the du Pont stock he transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.335" offset="18088730">We're talking about the tax on the transferor by virtue of receiving stock of the XYZ Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.623" offset="18121853">On that situation, it seems to me it's perfectly reasonable to say that in the absence of any better evidence of value, the stock of the XYZ Corporation on the date when the man transfers the du Pont stock to it, you can assume that the value of the XYZ Company is the value of the underlying asset, the du Pont stock, and that's perfectly reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.240" offset="18204296">But that doesn't happen to be the case in marital settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.902" offset="18223000">After Mr. Davis transferred a stock of the du Pont Company to Mrs. Davis, he didn't retain an interest in that stock through her.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.123" offset="18263855">He had no interest at all in the stock after he had once transferred it to her and let the worst had gone through.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.325" offset="18288724">Therefore, it's entirely unlike the situation when you transfer something and retain an indirect interest in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4682.853" offset="18834787">On both Mesta and Halliwell, the date of agreement and the date of transfer and the date of release of the wife's rights all occurred within one taxable year in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.813" offset="18890585">Here, unlike that situation, the agreement was executed in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.397" offset="18912946">The first transfer of the du Pont stock occurred in 1955 and the second half of the stock was transferred in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.031" offset="18951502">And the husband has still not fully performed all of his obligations under this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.818" offset="18974595">I think with that state of facts, it's perfectly reasonable to argue that Mrs. Davis released her rights against Mr. Davis and that is the consideration the Government says makes it a taxable event.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.579" offset="19025690">It's perfectly possible to argue that that event occurred in 1954 when Mrs. Davis signed the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.258" offset="19056410">It's also reasonable to argue that she still hasn't released her rights and won't until all of Mr. Davis' obligations under the agreement have been met and that one occur until 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.066" offset="19107610">However, I cannot believe that it's reasonable to argue that the release by Mrs. Davis occurred in March of 1955 when the most essential parts of the agreement were still not carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.917" offset="19175006">I suggested at the outset of my argument that there were two inquiries for which there must be affirmative answers before the Court of Claims should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.565" offset="19217638">The first was whether Mr. Davis had made a -- a transfer which is a disposition within the meaning of Section 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.914" offset="19251075">And the second is whether the fair market value of consideration moving to Mr. Davis exceeded his basis for the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.117" offset="19287855">I submit that both of those questions must be answered in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.666" offset="19306036">However, I submit that even if both of them are answered affirmatively, the Government has still picked the wrong year and has picked the wrong measure of gain with which to tax Mr. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.003" offset="19355355">Therefore, even if both questions are answered in the negative, I submit that the decision of the Court of Claims should be affirmed on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.468" offset="19393285">I would like to address myself now to the tax counsel fee issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.265" offset="19424423">In the Court of Claims, we were litigating about two tax counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.616" offset="19445844">There were other fees about which we were litigating but they are not here before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.097" offset="19471757">In the Court of Claims, we had two tax counsel fees involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.960" offset="19487222">One was the tax counsel fee, which Mr. Davis pays to his own attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.334" offset="19504671">The other was the tax counsel fee which Mr. Davis paid to the attorney who represented his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.389" offset="19532884">In the Court of Claims, the Government disapproved and fought the deduction of both tax counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.563" offset="19577605">Now, this phase of the case seems to me that posed purely an issue of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.319" offset="19604668">And on the statutory construction issue, the Court of Claims rejected the Government's contention that Section 212 (3) only applied to fees for contested tax matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.398" offset="19664959">However, the Court of Claims, while rejecting that interpretation of the statute, held that Mr. Davis was not entitled to a deduction for his wife's tax counsel fees but that decision was solely on the basis that they believe that the fees being to the wife's counsel rather than to the payor's counsel, they were not deductible under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.592" offset="19769762">Now, the Government didn't petition for certiorari with respect to this broader issue which was involved in the deduction of the husband's tax counsel fees paid it with his own counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.924" offset="19819081">And our petition was solely with respect to this matter of the deduction of the tax counsel fees paid to the wife's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.554" offset="19869550">Now, the Government pictures its principle argument on the statutory construction in terms of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.908" offset="19918973">And at points the two fragments of legislative history which it believes support the proposition that only fees were computing or contesting taxes or deductible under Section 212 (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.187" offset="19984071">The first is the statement in the Committee reports of Congress in connection with the 1954 Code which referred to deductions for contested tax matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.985" offset="20031300">I think the Government's argument has brought out the relationship between the decision of this Court in the Lykes case and the congressional action in 1954 in inserting Section 212 (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.870" offset="20086888">And with that background as to why Congress enacted Section 212 (3), it's obvious to me why in the Committee reports, in discussing this new provision, they've mentioned only by way of exemplification in my view, the matter of contested tax matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.171" offset="20156061">The reason for that is that in Lykes, this Court was dealing with a contested gift tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.456" offset="20185213">So it's quite natural for the draftsman of the Committee report having in mind the Lykes' decision to mention that as an example of the type of deduction which would now be a liable under Section 212 (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.374" offset="20232861">But certainly, I can't believe that the Committee report was intended to limit deductions under Section 212 (3) to just the matter which is exemplified in this Committee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.985" offset="20279359">And the Treasury its own regulations has conceded this because it has gone far beyond what it claims the Committee report group in describing this -- type of fees which can be deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.693" offset="20330141">Now, the second bill of legislative history which the Government brings in to this phase of the case is a very short excerpt from a written statement from the ABA Tax Section which was submitted to the Senate Finance Committee after a hearing for the Senate Finance Committee and that comment of the ABA Tax Section is really a comment about the House Committee report rather than a comment about the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.873" offset="20458872">That statement of the ABA states that the problem is not raised by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.119" offset="20487816">The problem was raised by the House Committee report and it recommends doing something about the Committee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.805" offset="20514565">Now, it strikes me if we're to bring in that type of legislative history where then embarked on a new course -- search for legislative history, we're now looking for history of legislative history rather than the history of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.011" offset="20587395">And in our brief, we've cited cases to show that in analyzing legislative history even the statements of members of Congress on the floor are not admissible for purposes of showing congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.637" offset="20645909">And if that so, I can't see how we can now consider statements in a written, long written document submitted to a congressional committee after a hearing which for all we know is never read by anyone in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.126" offset="20719888">Now, presenting ambiguity Section 212 (3), I submit that that ambiguity is completely dispelled by the Treasury Regulations which unequivocally provide for the deduction of tax counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.593" offset="20793762">That regulation provides, and here I'm reading, this is on page 25 of the taxpayer's brief, for the deduction of expenses paid or incurred by a taxpayer for a tax counsel or expenses paid or incurred in connection with the preparation of his tax returns or in connection with any proceedings involved in determining.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.466" offset="20893236">Now, if the Government's statement of this rule is correct then this regulation adds unnecessary words in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.970" offset="20923225">It should have said expenses paid or incurred by a taxpayer for tax counsel in connection with the preparation of his tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.600" offset="20957811">Obviously, they thought that tax counsel fees could be unrelated to these enumerated things which follow on the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5224.279" offset="21000443">In trust of Bingham, this Court approved a deduction of fees paid by a trustee for tax advice in connection with problems arising in connection with the distribution of a trust estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.456" offset="21061151">And that was before the 1954 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.218" offset="21076198">Now, it seems obvious to me that in 1954, Congress thought when they enacted Section 212 (3), they were introducing a liberalizing provision of the law, which the effect of which would be to change the rule of the Lykes' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.991" offset="21139310">I can't believe that Congress thought that in enacting Section 212 (3), they were going to limit the broad category of deductions which had therefore been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.379" offset="21200854">Now, the narrow ground on which the Court of Claims decided this tax counsel fee issue was on the ground that the counsel fee was paid by Mr. Davis, not to the attorney represented him, but to the attorney who represented the wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.469" offset="21269295">And I believe to understand why the taxpayers believed that that's immaterial for purposes of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.305" offset="21304613">It's necessary to understand that in Delaware as in most states, counsel fees incurred by a wife are considered necessaries for which the husband is obligated to pay just as he's obligated to pay for groceries for the wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.414" offset="21377024">Once it's determined that the tax counsel fees in this case are deductible by virtue of their nature regardless of who they're paid to and that I think the Treasury Regulations made clear then I see no reason in the statute or in legislative history or in any policy consideration for denying Mr. Davis a deduction for those fees merely because they were paid under his legal duty to pay them imposed on them by state law merely because they're paid by him to the attorney who represented his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.075" offset="21515682">Thank you.</text>
