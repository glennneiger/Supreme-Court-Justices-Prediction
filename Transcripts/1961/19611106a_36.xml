            <text syncTime="27.210" offset="212198">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.689" offset="230170">This case involves the question whether an official Government press release is a government publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.246" offset="272384">If it is, it may not be copyrighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.020" offset="291401">More broadly stated, the issue before this Court is whether any press release, government or private, is a government publication within the statutory restrictions against the copyrighting of government publication when it comprises a speech made by a high ranking Government official, delivered while on official duty and dealing with matters falling within the scope of his official duty or into the connection or relationship between that duty and the subject matter of the papers involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.299" offset="460570">The petitioner in this case sought the declaratory judgment that Vice Admiral Hyman G. Rickover had no copyrightable interest in 23 of his public speeches.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.457" offset="513233">We allege that this was so, because these were Government publications and therefore, we’re in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.791" offset="546565">The District Court held two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.857" offset="558791">First, that these were not Government publications and secondly, that there have not been any general publications and therefore copyright was properly taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.746" offset="610408">The Court of Appeals affirmed on the first point, reversed on the second point, and remanded for trial on a certain titles.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.623" offset="657847">The facts in this case are completely undisputed, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.493" offset="681357">The petitioner is a publisher operating in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.885" offset="698911">The respondent is the honorable and highly regarded Admiral Rickover, who during all of the time of these proceedings critical dates held two positions simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.275" offset="776443">Within the navy, he was the Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Ships for Nuclear Propulsion and simultaneously, within the Atomic Energy Commission, he was the Assistant Director for naval reactors.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.275" offset="840495">During all of the time when the critical facts before the Court were involved, the Admiral was engaged on two major government projects, the construction of this country's first atomic submarine, the Nautilus and the construction of this country's first commercial atomic power plant at Shippingport, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.871" offset="942895">Between October of 1955 and January of 1959, the Admiral made 23 speeches, publicly delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.900" offset="986990">I should like to break these down into two groups for the convenience of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.713" offset="1006216">The 23rd one had on its face a copyright registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.561" offset="1033592">The other 22 did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.082" offset="1047698">Among the first 22 speeches, 13 were issued as official press releases of the Department of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.414" offset="1097017">Owing to the fact that the printed record fails to disclose this clearly enough, I have asked the clerk to make available to me this morning the actual speech press releases that are in the record before this Court, this is from your record.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.923" offset="1159084">I have -- I've chosen four at random out of the 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.597" offset="1173713">You will note that in each one, this is the portion that was used by the clerk to print the record, this little piece here, you will note that across the top of each one of these speeches, the blue band news release please note this, Department of Defense, Office of Public Information, Washington D.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.446" offset="1253125">In the center is the CO of the Department of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.563" offset="1277576">Off to this side, hold for release until delivery of the press, off to this side is the Official Department's number of the press release number and its series.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.188" offset="1320103">Below that is the Department of Defense telephone and the extension of its Public Information Office, so that anyone can get further information.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.951" offset="1355212">This particular speech of the naval revolution, 13 were issued in this particular form.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.355" offset="1388753">Additionally to this, seven were issued by the Atomic Energy Commission and these again out of the right -- out of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.107" offset="1419786">Not quite as colorful, but across the side, AEC and on the top of it, United States Atomic Energy Commission, Washington D.C. for release and the telephone number for future information.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.480" offset="1477256">This particular one or I should say that in each case, the Admiral is identified by his official titles in both departments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.156" offset="5351946">Out of the 23, 10 are on naval warfare and atomic energy, 10 are on Education and three were delivered in connection with the bestowal on the Admiral of awards or medals for his government service by private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.284" offset="5420492">I should like to discuss each of these, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.207" offset="5432195">In the 10 dealing with atomic energy and naval warfare, two main subjects were discussed, the effect -- the industrial effect of atomic energy on naval construction and the revolutionary effect of atomic energy on naval warfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.070" offset="5507636">Let us look to the speeches themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.735" offset="5518294">The very first, I should say that on page 105 and 106 of the record is a list of these various speeches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.421" offset="5557060">And I shall refer -- with your kind permission, I shall refer to the numbers in the order in which they appear here which are in the date of delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.081" offset="5615679">The very first speech dealing with metallurgy and atomic power is devoted from the very outset and I quote, “To the major problems in the use of metals in the application of atomic energy to the propulsion of ships, and to the Admiral's besieging his audience, the National Metals Congress for help in solving these varied problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.328" offset="5728632">The eight speech, “The Challenge of Nuclear Power”, and I'm choosing two in each instance, exhorts industry to help in the technical and industrial aspects of his official job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.767" offset="5774399">Permit me to quote one paragraph and I'm quoting as indicated on our brief at page 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.807" offset="5810552">“Just as the strength of a chain is no greater than that of its weakest link, so that the successful operation of a nuclear power plant depends on the reliability of all its parts, not alone the nuclear reactor, but also the heat exchanges, pumps, valves etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.930" offset="5891114">In fact, our experience,” said the Admiral, “With the full operating plants of the naval reactors program has shown that it is these components, the industrial components, which are proved less reliable than the nuclear reactor itself and also their delivery time is poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.518" offset="5969481">Here, I believe is the challenge to industry,” he threw out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1490.270" offset="6064462">Mr. Chief -- Justice Frankfurter is always ahead of me, the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.904" offset="6078986">The purpose, the thrust of my argument is that all 23 of these speeches as will be indicated, are part of the official scope of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.565" offset="6125589">The second group in the first 10, dealt with the revolutionary effect of nuclear energy on naval warfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.037" offset="6155473">The second speech, nuclear power and the navy had as it theme and I quote, “The impact of nuclear power on the navy and two of the basic principles of waging naval warfare.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.595" offset="6217749">The speech goes on at great length to tell how the Nautilus, our submarine which he constructed came to be built, the navy's plans for future vessels of the same kind and the atomic energy's plans for future naval reactors, bearing in mind, both of these were his employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.905" offset="6294967">And the last of these 10 first speeches on industrial effect that I should like to quote, is the one revolution at sea 11 and 14 are substantially identical although with different titles and the theme here was, and I read from the bottom of page 29, “Today, our navy is in the midst of another change, conversion from oil to nuclear power and he deals at great length was the conversion to nuclear power and the resulting effect on naval warfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.883" offset="6438954">So much for the content of the first 10 speeches, now to the second 10 group and I don't mean to imply that the first 10 came in the first order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.602" offset="6477824">These are simply by classification, those dealing with the relationship of national defense for education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.145" offset="6507917">At this point, it is important to bring to the Court's attention as we've done on our brief, certain -- certain little known facts of record and a public record concerning the Admiral's own duties in his own job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.245" offset="6576358">It is our point, and I think sufficiently, we hope proved in the -- in the brief, that the Admiral's official duties, this particular Admiral's official duties required him to be an educator, to operate schools in his official duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.815" offset="6666637">I direct your attention to the quotation from the 23rd speech which appears on page 31 of our brief, in the middle of the page, you will recall that this was the speech that was attempted to be copyrighted before issuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.788" offset="6730480">I'll read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.937" offset="6739153">Though, and I'm quoting of course from the Admiral, “Though I have never taken a course in education, I have been running schools for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.396" offset="6780949">We have set up schools for our own engineers, and for our industrial people as well as for officers and men who operate on nuclear ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.730" offset="6818252">In our post-graduate program, we teach the exacting requirements of reactor design, construction and management.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.294" offset="6852524">In testimony before a congressional committee in the very period in question here between 55 and 59, specifically in 1957 and I quote from the bottom of page 34 of our brief, the Admiral's total to house appropriation to make, “We run quite a number of schools of our own because there is a great shortage of scientists and engineers and we found we could not depend too much on our schools and our available training program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.428" offset="6993063">We have to train our own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.785" offset="7002467">We are running at the present time within the period of question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.953" offset="7019186">A number of different schools within the naval program ranging from the one of the submarine base at New London, Connecticut for teaching nuclear theory to officers and unlisted man to others and I shall not continue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.402" offset="7076968">As a matter of fact, the record clearly shows -- the public record clearly shows that one of these schools was created by the Admiral for his own work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.799" offset="7126601">Speech number 15, dealing with education in the nuclear age, shows on its phase that was delivered as the dedication of the New London School to which he talks, which he created and he asks questions in his dedicatory remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.896" offset="7194937">“Why do we need a school here that cost so much money?</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.740" offset="7214373">Why do we need a school which is limited in its clientele?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.859" offset="7238823">And he answers, “Bearing in mind that this is the navy's nuclear expert number one, we have no choice, but to develop a new kind of navy man to run a new kind of ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.606" offset="7297755">The schools -- the school provides the kind of education needed by officers and men of a nuclear navy not provided elsewhere.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.341" offset="7344776">I have indicated that he was employed by two agencies by the Atomic Energy Commission as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.652" offset="7369958">He created a school for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.591" offset="7381765">I quote from his testimony before a congressional committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.236" offset="7400364">In 1959 when he was asked by the chairman of the committee to state your qualifications for talking about education, and in part the Admiral said, “I was instrumental in setting up the Oakridge School of Reactor Technology in Oakridge for the Atomic Energy Commission.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4301.082" offset="17307669">Here, we have a man of great intellect and enormous energy, who threw his work in the navy, has come to the conclusion that what this country needs is better education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.248" offset="17372348">Shortly after the Second World War, he had a great fortune to be assigned to Oakridge with a small team to decide whether it would be possible to use the power in connection with atomic fusion and he came back recommending that it could be used -- that it could be used for propulsion of vessels and that it could be used and should be used in submarines because that's where it would be the most useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.566" offset="17497631">The success of his recommendation attracted so much attention that requests to make speeches came in with regularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.167" offset="17536084">He took these opportunities and in the course of the speeches while some of them quite naturally deal with his experiences and the first one was before the Metals Congress, very natural that he would talk to them about the problems in connection with metals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.870" offset="17606823">But practically every speech, I won't say everyone, but practically every speech hits on this idea of improving American education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.070" offset="17659695">Now, I don't want to spend too much time on this portion of it because I have a great deal to talk about the matter of dedication in connection with the case Number 55, whether or not the early speeches were dedicated, but I do want to emphasize that the first 12 of these speeches were delivered before Sputnik was fired and this man anticipated and named the lead that Russia had and he drove on the subject of doing a better job in this field of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.223" offset="17804309">In speech number six, which was November 20, 1956 a year before Sputnik, what concerns me most about the Russian school program is not the coercive element, which speaks totalitarian programs, but the solid evidence that Russia has found a way to inspire her children with the desire to put forth their utmost mental efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.934" offset="17895111">And right after Sputnik, November 22, 1957, the powerful thrust of Sputnik's launching device did more than penetrate outer space.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.339" offset="17940773">It also appears that thick armor and casing our complaisant in America's present and future technological supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.289" offset="17976508">Now, time doesn't permit an analysis of each of these 22 speeches, but they were all delivered with mounting emphasis toward this question of education to such extent that he drew down upon his shoulders the rest of all the educators or as he calls them “educationists.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.905" offset="18075042">Now, I shall concentrate in the first part of this argument, on the fact that the speeches as written belong to the Admiral, the second half will be that he did not dedicate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.747" offset="18134392">Now, the first half I divide as follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="5955.839" offset="23926680">It must be clear that if they were picking a spokesman, he would be one of the last, if not the last chosen as the department's spokesman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5968.942" offset="23979133">These speeches therefore as I see it were entirely the Admiral's, people hearing him, knew that he was speaking his own mind and they, therefore, should not be considered as having belonged to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5992.905" offset="24074951">And the interpretation placed on these speeches by the superintendent of documents is interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="6001.894" offset="24111000">It may not be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="6003.296" offset="24116537">I think this is a question of law that has to be decided by a Court, and now by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6010.091" offset="24143705">But, I regarded as extremely important that the monthly catalog of Government publications, which lists many publications including process publications, meaning, those which are not printed by the conventional method, but including multi (Inaudible), those catalogs do not include at any of these speeches.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.075" offset="24255718">And the requirement is, as stated right on the cover of the monthly catalog.</text>
            <text syncTime="6043.061" offset="24275571">Under the provisions of the Printing Act of January 12 1895, all government publications are listed in the monthly catalog.</text>

            <text syncTime="6072.469" offset="24393226">And this is a lack of appreciation of what is an official number.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.785" offset="24414542">The number that you see on the top of those speeches is followed by a year date.</text>
            <text syncTime="6082.802" offset="24434604">This is just a multi living job, a job number in the Multi-List Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="6088.999" offset="24459368">And in the text, which is cited by Mr. Rosenfield, void and rips on government publications, the 1949 edition 52 re-print, which I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="6100.382" offset="24504926">On page 210 it says, “In dealing with Navy Department publications, since World War II, there have been so many publications of the Department that each Navy publication, there is a symbol indicating the issuing bureau followed by a number.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.553" offset="24585592">For example, NAVPERS, N-A-V-P-E-R-S, it's capital letters and then a number, NAVMED for the medical code.</text>
            <text syncTime="6129.302" offset="24620596">And for the Bureau of Ships in which the Admiral serves, NAVSHIPS, and in this Government catalog you will find subdivisions so that under Navy, you'll come to view ship, but under view ship nothing with respect to the Admiral's speeches, so for what it is worth, the superintendent of documents doesn't list them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.094" offset="24703770">And the semi-annual list of periodicals released as statistical statements which up until February of 1961 was carried in the catalog of government publications are headed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6170.241" offset="24784332">All publications received by the division of public documents library are listed in this portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.740" offset="24846294">I would like to say a word about the nature of the speeches from the standpoint of containing technical information.</text>
            <text syncTime="6194.283" offset="24880462">As indicated in the brief, the data concerning the development of nuclear power particularly in connection with the shipping ports speech which is I see it is the most technical one of the whole list.</text>
            <text syncTime="6213.853" offset="24958830">That is on page 46 and 47 of our brief, gives information concerning the extent to which the data was already in the hands of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="6237.786" offset="25054542">Now, the second and third parts of my opening half of this argument are designed to stress the fact that this was not an impairment of the public's right to know and that it acted for the benefit of the department and the country for him to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.423" offset="25129044">Much has been made about the difficulty of this fair use concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.721" offset="25146284">And I will grant that in many cases it's difficult to determine just how much had been use is fair, but this is something which depends on each particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.818" offset="25198634">And I am sure that in this situation where the Admiral distributes press releases, hold press releases, hold for release until so and so, it's obvious that the press that is the newspapers and the news periodicals can certainly take, they're invited to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="6293.070" offset="25275643">Even if he didn't have at the foot, no permission needed when newspaper or news periodical use right above the copyright notice, the newspapers could still use that material because it is news worthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6307.905" offset="25334993">They could cover the speech by saying, “Last night Admiral Rickover said” and it's inconceivable to me that any copyright under those circumstances would be able successfully to proceed against the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="6325.748" offset="25406360">Now, it's also essential to bear in mind that the copyright does intend to bottle up any this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="6336.394" offset="25448991">The information itself, the ideas conveyed in the speeches can be used by anyone, people other than newspaper publishers, the writers of a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="6347.635" offset="25493922">This plaintiff, petitioner in number 36 could have written a book and describe what Rickover thinks and use elements from his speeches to the greatest extent he'd wished without running --</text>

            <text syncTime="6362.831" offset="25554735">-- without filing the copyright law because he would be discussing principally in his own words, what the Admiral had said, if he lifted large quotations, he would have some latitude there, but there's a tremendous difference between merely taking excerpts and doing what the plaintiff-petitioner in 36 intended to do, publish the speeches.</text>
            <text syncTime="6387.748" offset="25654314">As indicated in Exhibit 5, the letter from Mr. Edmondson the vice -- the Executive Vice President of the (Inaudible), the publisher of the Admiral's book Education and Freedom based on the first nine or ten of these speeches.</text>
            <text syncTime="6401.066" offset="25707604">It would be very unfortunately he said to Mr. Schnapper following up on Schnapper's threat to sue the Admiral if he didn't get permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6411.005" offset="25747414">It would be very unfortunate to have two volumes of the speeches on the bookshelves currently.</text>
            <text syncTime="6420.273" offset="25784508">This would be a disorganized approach and what the Admiral did was rewrite the nine to form the basis for his education and freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="6429.966" offset="25823274">And that's an important consideration because no man likes to have a collection of 20 speeches unedited put out in the batch.</text>
            <text syncTime="6437.895" offset="25854934">At the end of three years this is what Rickover thinks to take that title as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="6442.944" offset="25875101">I think this would be unfair, because if he wants people to see in a book what he thinks, he'll present it in book form.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.301" offset="25904567">There's a tremendous difference between the two media.</text>
