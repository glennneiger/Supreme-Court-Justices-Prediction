            <text syncTime="20.228" offset="184299">Mr. Rauh you may proceed with your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="27.406" offset="213034">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.835" offset="226722">What is under review here is the conviction of petitioner, Robert Shelton, a copyeditor on the New York Times for contempt of Congress in refusing to answer two questions concerning communism put to him by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.612" offset="333824">Petitioner, despite an unblemished record and his ability to keep his job was sentenced to six months in jail and his conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.673" offset="410102">The facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.353" offset="424835">It's hard to know just how this investigation got started, but since Chairman Eastland suggested that it starts with a man Winston Burdett, we will assume that in someway, the overall investigation got started through him.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.811" offset="510621">In June of 1955, Winston Burdett, a CBS radio commentator testified before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in the course of hearings on strategy and tactics of world communism, he revealed that he had been a member of the Communist Party in the late 30's and early 40's when he had been employed by the Brooklyn Eagle.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.763" offset="638412">He did not mention petitioner nor, and the record is clear on this, has anyone ever at any time mentioned petitioner in any public hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.244" offset="704345">As to the private hearing, we will come to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.504" offset="729422">Well, Mr. Burdett testified in June of 1955, in November -- on November 24, 1955, an aide of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee showed up at the New York Times with 30 subpoenas under his arm for an executive session of that committee on December 7, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.112" offset="839868">In order to make it easier to find the people in New York Times, had assigned a man to help locate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.370" offset="868812">So the aide of the committee went to this man and showed him some names and they finally got to a name, a subpoena for a man named Willard Shelton, a nationally known columnist.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.356" offset="936835">“Well,” said the man who was in the Times, “There isn't any.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.117" offset="955852">We have no Willard Shelton.”</text>
            <text syncTime="216.623" offset="969853">So there must have been some talk and it isn't clear and then the man said, “We have a few others.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.736" offset="994304">We have one -- we have some in the typo side, we have one on the news or editorial side.”</text>
            <text syncTime="231.099" offset="1027741">So the aide of the committee says, “What's his name?”</text>
            <text syncTime="234.889" offset="1042892">He says, “Well, it's Robert Shelton.”</text>
            <text syncTime="238.842" offset="1058774">So the committee aide wasn't clear what to do so he called back to the -- subcommittee, talked to the subcommittee counsel, Mr. Sourwine, who talked to Chairman Eastland who said, “Tell him to come.”</text>
            <text syncTime="253.130" offset="1115930">So the subcommittee aide took the subpoena and he wrote -- and it had in it -- typed-in “Willard Shelton” and he wrote-in “or Robert Shelton” and the man was brought in to receive his subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.568" offset="1165667">Now, let me make it perfectly clear here and now, we are not raising a technical question of whether the subpoena is legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.182" offset="1196074">They had issued another one we haven't -- that's of no significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.371" offset="1208822">What is of significance of course is the whole case then began to revolve around the fact that the committee had no probable or any other type of cause for calling him.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.233" offset="1280293">On this December 7, 1955, he appeared in the executive session pursuant to this subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.254" offset="1308400">No, I want to be more accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.012" offset="1315401">They gave him another subpoena just for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.743" offset="1326373">He could have one all by himself but the -- before December 7th, they had given him another subpoena just for Robert Shelton and he did appear on December 7, 1955 before the executive session.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.516" offset="1385409">After preliminary questions of the most routine nature, he was asked to answer the question whether he was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.435" offset="1425115">He said, I -- he pleaded the First Amendment, the scope for the committee's authority and he said, “The actual basis for the inquiry has not been stated to me nor does it appear on the subpoena.”</text>
            <text syncTime="345.848" offset="1486764">A very significant thing then happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.596" offset="1497736">Subcommittee counsel Mr. Sourwine said, “I am greatly surprised.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.313" offset="1520619">This witness was not charged with being a communist and I am surprised that he has taken this attitude or refusing to answer this question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="363.808" offset="1558653">That more or less wound up with a little more, the executive session, and that is not the session from which the indictment flowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.809" offset="2410559">They didn't have any.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.711" offset="2414216">We thought that be the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.701" offset="2426128">The judge -- the Government argued, “Oh, you can't have that because we don't need probable cause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="585.970" offset="2447235">The judge quashed the subpoena so we went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.465" offset="2469282">The prosecution started in by this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.380" offset="2484851">We do not have to prove probable cause because a congressional committee can call the man off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.072" offset="2527692">That's on page 40 of the record because I thought maybe you wouldn't believe me that a representative of the United States of America had said, “We can call a man off the street.”</text>
            <text syncTime="619.274" offset="2580459">But he said -- I must say, I said that was shocking then, and I feel the same way now, and I'm going to show that this is essentially what the position of the Government of the United States is today in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.044" offset="2647542">But he said, “I'm not going to just rely on the man off the street doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.647" offset="2661961">I want to prove that we had probable cause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="644.841" offset="2682755">So he called subcommittee counsel Sourwine.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.654" offset="2701981">Now remember that in 1957, at the executive session, subcommittee counsel Sourwine said, “I'm greatly surprised when this man -- when petitioner refused to answer,” and said, “This witness is not accused of being a communist.”</text>
            <text syncTime="668.639" offset="2777945">Then a year later at the trial, Mr. Sourwine made a 180 degree shift.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.765" offset="2814412">He remembered a letter, a letter with an informant pseudonym X which had been received by the Committee within one to three months prior to the December 1955 executive session.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.477" offset="2881285">Now, all that he could remember about this letter was this one sentence approximately as I give it to you now, from this informant pseudonym X.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.635" offset="3021928">The committee had at the time when subpoena was issued information that a man named Shelton who was employed in the news department or city side of the New York Times, who's a member of a communist group on the time, was active in the affairs of that group and would be or should be in a position to give the committee information about the activities of that group.</text>

            <text syncTime="2199.121" offset="8899897">There is not -- assuming the Government is right that it's only likelihood, assuming I'm wrong that it has to be probable cause under the Fourth Amendment, there's nothing to show likelihood, because the only thing on which they predicate likelihood of information is a letter that was withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.932" offset="8979101">In other words, the Government couldn't quite say we're relying on this letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.105" offset="8999790">They used the letter five times in their brief but they never explained how they can rely on it when it was withheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.828" offset="9050676">They admit there is nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.798" offset="9058513">So you know what they finally come up with?</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.263" offset="9068440">They've come up with the argument that it's unreviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.696" offset="9082128">They have come up now finally, if Your Honors will look on pages 59 and 60 of the Government's brief, their final argument is this Court has no grounds on which to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.184" offset="9132074">You cannot review whether there was a likelihood and I would just like to read this sentence from the concurring opinion in Watkins by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, which seems to me that answer the Government's unreviewability argument better than any way I could put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.830" offset="9226742">“By making the federal judiciary, the affirmative agency for enforcing the authority that underlies the congressional power to punish for contempt, Congress necessarily brings into play the specific provisions of the Constitution relating to the prosecution of our offenses and those implied restrictions under which the Court functions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.384" offset="9324857">Now, if Your Honors please, the Government has admitted, they have to have a likelihood of information from this witness in order to call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.475" offset="9357249">We said it's probable cause but they admit likelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.453" offset="9369161">The only likelihood is a document that's been withheld wrongfully under the confrontation part of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.510" offset="9401448">This Court has made clear that the -- well, its processes will not be used to punish people criminally unless the Sixth Amendment, unless the processes of the Court can be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.259" offset="9448364">Therefore, even on the Government's theory of likelihood, there is no possible way in which this conviction can be sustained because it just so many words, the Government in five years of litigation has never told us how they could use this letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.746" offset="9518373">I hope tomorrow, we will find out at long last what the Government's theory is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.390" offset="9540942">They've thrown away the theory of the Court of Appeals namely, that you could anybody out in the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.501" offset="9565393">They have said -- they have relied on a letter that we weren't shown under circumstances where it's quite obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.736" offset="9590366">We made a prime facie case of incredibility even though we didn't have to, and now they say to us at a final matter, this is unreviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.716" offset="9626206">Your Honors cannot question whether there was the likelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.484" offset="9641357">In other words, the Government's position in this Court is really back to where I was in the District Court when the prosecutor said we can call the man off the street.</text>
