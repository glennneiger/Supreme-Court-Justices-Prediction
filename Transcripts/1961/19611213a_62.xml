            <label>Mr. Glen A. Wilkinson</label>
            <text syncTime="14.316" offset="160684">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.516" offset="181478">This case is here by virtue of an order of this Court granting a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis in a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court for the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.780" offset="270503">The facts if the Court please, are these, Paul Seymour, the petitioner is an American Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.400" offset="317001">He is an enrolled member of the Colville Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.403" offset="364962">On or before August 25, 1956, the petitioner with others burglarized and I will assume during all of my statement that the facts of the burglary are true, burglarized the market in the Village of East Omak, in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.979" offset="487320">I should like to refer the Court at this point to Appendix B of our opening brief which contains a sketch of the Colville Indian Reservation as it existed prior to 1892.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.550" offset="561612">If the Court please, you will note that the northern boundary is the Canadian boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.670" offset="590033">The eastern and southern boundaries are the Columbia River.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.095" offset="611767">The western boundary is the Okanogan River.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.761" offset="630366">You will note that inside the boundary on the west -- on the east side of the Okanogan River is the Village of East Omak.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.363" offset="688776">On August 27, 1956, Seymour was arraigned in the Superior Court in and for the County of Okanogan.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.601" offset="733811">He was charged with the state crime of burglary in a second degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.985" offset="755336">He pleaded not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.531" offset="765471">On October 09, 1956, not quite two months later, he appeared in the court with appointed counsel and counsel asked to leave under the Washington procedure to withdraw the plea of not guilty to the crime of burglary in the second degree and to enter a plea to the crime of attempt of burglary in the second degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.138" offset="875917">That request was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.508" offset="889396">The Court sentenced petitioner to a term of not to exceed seven and a half years in the state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.983" offset="923355">Apparently, under the Washington State procedure that is in referred to the appropriate administrative body and that body took action to set seven and a half years as the minimum punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.584" offset="981661">After confinement, Seymour applied to the Supreme Court to the State Washington for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.975" offset="1027323">Among other allegations, he alleged that the crime committed was within Indian country as defined by Section 1151 of Title 18 of the United States Code and that therefore, the States of Washington had no jurisdiction to try or sentence him.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.540" offset="1121573">To return an answer of the Superintendent of the Washington State Penitentiary according to the Washington Supreme Court raised factual issues which it referred to the Superior Court in and for the County of Okanogan.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.898" offset="1194924">It was to determine among other things whether the locus of the crime was within Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.539" offset="1225540">The Superior Court held a hearing, took testimony and it made a study of the statutes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.413" offset="1261066">It held that the situs of the crime was not Indian country and that therefore, the courts of the State of Washington had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.328" offset="1304639">In reaching this conclusion, it followed the prior ruling of its own at 1919 relating to the same reservation and concluded that since the precise track of land upon which the crime was committed had passed from Indian travel ownership to a trust a lot in status to an individual member and then to a non-Indian in fee simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.954" offset="1423235">The area was not within Indian country as defined by the Federal Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.567" offset="1465657">On brief, this is the issue which is before this Court today namely, was the locus of the crime within Indian country as defined by Section 1151 (a) of the Federal Criminal Code, Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.787" offset="1566490">That section reads, “All land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government notwithstanding the issuance of any patent is Indian country and as to Indian country federal jurisdiction is exclusive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="393.381" offset="1676936">We say the Washington Supreme Court committed error to show that it did -- it's necessary to review a series of four activities relating to the Colville Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.240" offset="1752377">The first concerns the period prior to 1872.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.895" offset="1774947">Prior to that date, Colville Tribe and the tribes which are affiliated with it and now still occupied the Colville Indian Reservation occupied a considerably larger area generally in the northeastern section of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.473" offset="1845269">On July 02, 1872, an executive order was promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.328" offset="1880691">That set forth the boundary of the reservation as I previously indicated to the Court namely, the Canadian border on the north, the Columbia River on the east and south and the Okanogan River on the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.470" offset="1953207">The next step which is pertinent is an Act of Congress of July 01, 1892, that Act related and affect -- related to and affected only the North Half of the Colville Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.047" offset="2031574">As the Court will see the North Half has been indicated on the sketch mark Appendix B to our opening brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="534.262" offset="2240449">In addition, it described as paralleling the 49th parallel of latitude that marked -- the line we've marked in the center of our sketch as the center limit of the area vacated and restored to the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.685" offset="2318085">In addition, it provided the proceeds and the sales or entries of lands and the North Half should be deposited in the treasury of the United States to be used for public use.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.709" offset="2386213">The next and last act that's necessary to refer to is the Act of Congress of March 22, 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.271" offset="2416410">This Act related to the South Half, what we've called the diminished reservation and which includes the town of East Omak.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.127" offset="2663842">The other distinction between the Act of 1892 and the Act of 1906 is that the Act of 1892 drew a new boundary, tracks it with midway through the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.555" offset="2721625">The 1892 Act in effect separated the North Half from the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1276.629" offset="5209840">In conclusion, we submit that the Supreme Court of the State of Washington should be reversed then that the petitioner Seymour must be released in custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.146" offset="5779937">-- he relies somewhat on the same ground as the petitioner here that a continuation of acts by Congress recognizes a continuing existence and extent to the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.717" offset="5830196">Now, number one, Congress has never defined what it means by a reservation, an Indian reservation at least, in the Indian law or the laws relating to Indian criminals jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.713" offset="5878262">]Number two, each one of these Acts, the subsequent acts deals not with the subject of criminal jurisdiction and at least two of those Acts, the Act of March, 1918 and the one in 1920 to which I will refer later speaks of the former Colville Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.306" offset="5976586">Now, that certainly does not show an intention of a continuing recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.842" offset="5998738">And on those grounds Your Honor, we feel that that has a little substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.478" offset="6025279">Now, due process, the due process question has depended of course on whether or not the United States Court or the state courts had jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.756" offset="6074389">And this is dependent upon an interpretation principally of Section 1151 and 1153 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.189" offset="6112110">1153 is the so-called Major Crimes Act which let's say number of crimes, one of which is burglary which no doubt includes the lesser -- included offense of attempted burglary which was committed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.281" offset="6176475">Now, 1153 in order for jurisdiction to best in the United States Court, the crime must have been committed in Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.730" offset="6218271">Now, I believe it is clear that even a crime is committed by an Indian on lands clearly within the jurisdiction of the state courts that there is no question as to whether or not that court might assume the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.495" offset="6289324">Now, Section 1151 provides Indian country a means all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.578" offset="6349720">Now, as I pointed out, Congress has not indicated what it means by an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.066" offset="6391620">Therefore, we submit that the definition is a subject for judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.139" offset="6419937">Now, the Act of March 22, 1906, opened to sale, entry, and settlement by non-Indians large portions of the Colville.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.868" offset="6490885">Now, we submit Your Honors that it is inconsistent to maintain that the lands so sold and settled upon can be set aside for the use and occupancy of Indians and at the same time for the use and occupancy of non-Indians.</text>

            <label>Mr. Glen A. Wilkinson</label>
            <text syncTime="3209.218" offset="12940204">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.242" offset="12944384">As I understand Mr. Way's addressed during the argument it is this, the Secretary of the Interior after his proclamation of 1916 which he issued pursuant to the Act of 1906 set aside the townsite of East Omak and that by doing so, he redefined and excluded the townsite of East Omak from the Colville Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.614" offset="13073847">First, that's not possible without Act of Congress as this Court itself has held not even this Court could redefine the reservation in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.403" offset="13132988">Now, there are principles in this field where you seem to be going one way at one time, in one way in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.040" offset="13179486">But I just like to go briefly through Section 1151 and demonstrate to this Court the Congress when finally amended this Act knew precisely what it was doing.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="3280.689" offset="13226088">What was the date of the amendment, Mr. Wilkinson?</text>

            <label>Mr. Glen A. Wilkinson</label>
            <text syncTime="3282.444" offset="13233194">The date of the amendment which includes the phrase notwithstanding the issuance of any patent was in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.017" offset="13275408">And that amendment was recommended by the Department of the Interior as you can see from 61 Interior decisions 298, in 1942 when it was precisely to meet this situation.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="3307.840" offset="13334758">May I ask you -- disturb you before you go about going with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.788" offset="13358477">I think it helped me understand it better.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.931" offset="13367045">You understand the basis on which the state Supreme Court reads its conclusion that this was not Indian country?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="glen_a_wilkinson" startTime="3322.874" stopTime="3402.522">
            <label>Mr. Glen A. Wilkinson</label>
            <text syncTime="3322.874" offset="13394840">As I understand it and there's a serious factual error in that opinion which I believe makes it difficult to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.027" offset="13427440">You alluded to Mr. Justice when you mentioned their phraseology South Half of the diminished reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.254" offset="13464430">That has no meaning and indicates to me only that they were confused with the term “South Half” and “Diminished”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.233" offset="13500270">Actually those terms are synonymous and they both referred to what we've shown in our sketch in Appendix B as the diminished reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.370" offset="13540812">In the whole history of this, except for the two opinions that Washington Supreme Court nowhere is their phrase South Half of the diminished reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.281" offset="13584488">Now, as I understand that opinion, they say that the act of issuance of fee patent to non-Indians acts to exclude those tracks from within the outer boundaries of the reservation and that those particular tracks are therefore no longer Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.514" offset="13681455">And I say that's contrary to the clear language, intention, and purpose of Section 1151.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3402.522" stopTime="3453.096">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="3402.522" offset="13713429">Before you proceed on the argument on which you've been embarked so I do not want to interrupt you.But will you absorb this difficulty, this question of mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.385" offset="13756897">I was a little surprised that something -- something raising a question that the Secretary of the Interior could then track what is within Indian country by any issue of any patent but assume that that is so, assume he could do that, assume it's the way the argument prevails, and it was done could the Amendment of 1948, the Negro Act can then undo what he purported to do lessen your strive, would you take that?</text>

          <turn speaker="glen_a_wilkinson" startTime="3453.096" stopTime="3678.973">
            <label>Mr. Glen A. Wilkinson</label>
            <text syncTime="3453.096" offset="13915721">Your Honor, I'm not certain but I would have to express some doubt whether it could be retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.583" offset="13953755">But I think that even taking the cases and the definition which was then in both governing the 10 major federal crimes that those tracks would have been within the limits of Indian reservations which was the language in the law at that time and that it would still be exclusive federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.365" offset="14076844">But I would like to go on now very briefly if I may just go through the Section 1151 and reminds the Court where all of the phrases in this come from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.468" offset="14129194">First, as I start to indicate, the 1948 Amendment which is the language in Section 8 notwithstanding the issuance of any patent was adopted in 1948 was recommended to the Attorney General by the Department of the Interior in 1942 and it eventually got to Congress and it was enacted and included within this Section for the specific purpose of covering the situation like we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.919" offset="14255000">The Solicitor of the Department of the Interior and others had said that if we don't have all inclusive boundaries surround an area of Indian country, it means the law enforcement officers are going to have to carry track books around where they find out whether this man's patent is in fee or just what the situation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.836" offset="14338696">To make it crystal clear that all area within the exterior boundaries of reservation was Indian country, Congress included this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.339" offset="14384776">Now, the phrase “rights of way running through the reservation” which follows that was 1932 Amendment by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.130" offset="14419884">Nothing more than the codification to get around to this Court's ruling in the Clairmont case in 225 U.S. where Indian trip -- Indian liquor laws were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.104" offset="14491773">The man was arrested on a right of way, railroad right of way where they have a fee patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.000" offset="14519359">This Court said that was no longer exclusive federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.165" offset="14544018">The subsection (c) of Section 1151 is nothing more than a codification of United States, Pelican -- against Pelican 232 U.S. which involved the North Half of this precise reservation and where this Court decided that was on an Indian trust allotment that that was still federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.409" offset="14665017">The rest of the North Half became state jurisdiction and in substance if the Court say -- the Court please, an answer to one question, it's my opinion that this Court must decide whether the situs of the crime within the townsite of East Omak was Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.467" offset="14773269">If it was Indian country, the petitioner has been deprived of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.398" offset="14800959">He is being held by ruling of a court which had no jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="3678.973" offset="14819244">May I ask you, do either one that you show whether the Federal Government has been prosecuting crimes committed in that town before this?</text>

            <text syncTime="3689.552" offset="14861563">I can't point to any Your Honor but I'm positive in my own mind that is happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.152" offset="14912031">And certainly, you see from our brief that I think about page 20 that the State has this claim or the Supreme Court has ruled that the state courts have no jurisdiction or the Yakima reservation which is situation identical with Colville.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.586" offset="15001684">Thank you.</text>
