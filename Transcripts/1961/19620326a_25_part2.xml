            <text syncTime="6.099" offset="127770">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.161" offset="139995">Before the lunch period, I have mentioned that our second disagreement in this case through the courts has been with the testimony of Senator McClellan.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.931" offset="195062">Now, Senator McClellan did testify and his testimony date may -- maybe broken down into four general categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.203" offset="228185">First -- first of which, he testified to the resolutions which in the authorizing resolutions and the rules of procedure that were enacted pursuant thereto, he testified concerning the investigations that the Committee had handled in the past and the recommendations which they had made with special findings relative to certain individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.100" offset="343751">He was then permitted to testify by reading the testimony of Investigator Sheridan before the Committee as a corroboration of Sheridan's testimony because Sheridan later did testify to the same things that the Senator read from the Committee record.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.534" offset="469556">I might add at this point that the case was tried and conceived by the prosecutor and conceived by the trial court as if it were an attempt on the part of the prosecutor to lay a foundation to show pertinency before the Committee and that can be seen by the evidence which the trial court did let in and asserted throughout the trial and in overruling the objections to the Senator's testimony and in his charge that the relevancy or the pertinency of these documents to the question under inquiry by the Committee was a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.205" offset="664221">The evidence before categories of evidence that was offered by Senator McClellan substantially were exclusively for the proof of that element viewed by the prosecution in the trial court as questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.967" offset="743215">This testimony was offered or admitted over the objection of -- of the defendant and from it the prosecutor cross-examined the -- the petitioner and made the rather derogatory remarks about members of the Teamster's Union a part -- a large part of this argument to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.992" offset="1039339">The -- the crowning thorn of -- of what we think is the objectionable evidence is when the Senator was permitted to testify before the jury that the documents which were the subject of the -- of the subpoena and for which the petitioner had been indicted were in fact and in law pertinent to the investigation of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.338" offset="1188760">In this regard, we feel that the -- the Court treated the pertinency or relevancy question as a matter of fact when in fact it is a matter of law if the trial court were correct, the question of facts should have been submitted to the jury without the conclusions of the -- of the Senator upon that -- that element which should have been in his view a matter of fact for their -- for their determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.336" offset="1724688">Now, the basic questions in this case concerned the validity of the subpoena and the admissibility of Senator McClellan's testimony but there is a threshold question as to whether the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction evidence be going to knowledge, evidence going to the obstruction itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.700" offset="1822177">And perhaps for the first few minutes of my argument it might be helpful if I discuss the particular elements of this crime of obstructing congressional committee and sketch out some of the bake -- back -- basic background facts concerning the nature of the investigation and the documents involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.480" offset="1925308">Now, the crime of obstructing or endeavoring to obstruct a congressional committee as the Government sees it consists of four elements at least as it concerns this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.326" offset="1972642">The first one is that there must be a duly authorized investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.574" offset="1993644">Secondly, that the documents or records, the information which the Committee is seeking must be pertinent to the subject matter of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.316" offset="2040665">Thirdly, the defendant must have committed acts with respect to those documents which in fact constitutes an -- constitute an obstruction or an endeavor to obstruct.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.565" offset="2089671">And ultimately, he must also be shown to have a specific guilty knowledge, a specific intent to obstruct the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.730" offset="2122271">And it was the Government's contention that all of these elements were proved beyond a reasonable doubt at the trial below.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.212" offset="2164172">Now, it's clear that the congressional inquiry investigation was properly authorized --</text>

            <text syncTime="828.867" offset="3418885">So, in fact -- well, let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.854" offset="3442813">As a matter of law, the question of pertinency is for the judge to determine as a matter of law according to Sinclair and Braden.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.041" offset="3475519">In the present case, at least part of the question of pertinency and I must admit that the major part, the relationship of the documents to the specific entry was submitted to the jury as a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.058" offset="3539571">And perhaps, even though we're out of order in argument, I -- first we should clear this up because this involves two -- two questions really.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.085" offset="3583666">First of all, the question in regard to Senator McClellan's testimony as related to the issue of pertinency whether it was within the discretion of the judge in the absence of objection to allow the jury to hear the question of pertinency or in all the testimony which went to pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.103" offset="3663809">And then you have a second question namely even if it is not -- or even if it is within the discretion of the judge to allow the jury to hear it, is it also within the discretion of the judge to submit that this question of pertinency to the jury in the absence of objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.498" offset="3741341">And perhaps, I should turn to that now because it probably is concerning you and let's try and -- a couple of this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.917" offset="3787003">The question of -- first of all as I mentioned, it is a matter of law to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.588" offset="3845726">But while Senator McClellan was testifying, and indeed throughout the whole trial although there were specific and general objections to various portions of this testimony, there was no objection to his presenting any evidence as to pertinency to the jury as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.454" offset="3925138">You can look through the record in vain for these objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.333" offset="3940707">And we take the position that in the absence of the objection there, the petitioner cannot -- should not be able to raise the objection here before the Court and indeed considering the Braden case, which of course was precisely the reverse situation in which the petitioner said, “It should be submitted to the jury rather than the judge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="981.153" offset="4027956">This Court did point out in the opinion Mr. Justice Stewart that he did not raise an objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.586" offset="4053765">But to be sure, he went on to say that even so as a matter of law, it was handled correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.689" offset="4082082">In addition, however, and this -- we now come to one of the peculiarities of the statute namely that pertinency isn't by -- specific words in -- injected into the statute and isn't in fact -- and related obstruction of justice statutes when you -- a statute when you're dealing with impeding a witness, the concept of pertinency has no place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.573" offset="4181661">I mean you have to make sure of is that the -- the person is to be a witness in one way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.370" offset="4304854">But peculiarly enough, in this situation, the testimony or the issues as to pertinency are -- seemed to be so inextricably interrelated with the question of knowledge of the petitioner, the motive of the petitioner, indeed obstruction itself that under these circumstances, we believe that it was not outside the discretion of the justice submitted, especially when you do turn for example to the exact testimony of Senator McClellan because virtually, every word, every sentence of his testimony, not only went to pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.642" offset="4457932">It went to knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.942" offset="4463156">It went to motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.636" offset="4469948">I think it would have been rather difficult situation for the judge to say right here, you must stop Senator McClellan and we'll hear that testimony outside the -- and dismiss the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.493" offset="4525328">Now, the next sentence we will bring the jury in, especially I should think in a situation such as we have here where the judge under proper admin -- admonition to the jury with careful explanation to the jury as to precisely the limited purpose for which the Senator's testimony as to pertinency was being presented to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.793" offset="4630549">I think it was within his broad discretion in the absence of objection to allow the jury to hear this testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.049" offset="4659597">And I -- just for -- perhaps the Court will be interested, cite to you pages -- during the testimony itself, pages 31 and 32, 35 and 36, 42 and 43 where this -- you have this constant admonition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.007" offset="4723440">Indeed and the judges charged to the jury when he dealt with Senator McClellan's testimony, when he dealt with the issue of pertinency, he specifically told them that this particular testimony relating to this subject was allowed and not for purposes of -- for example corroboration, but it was allowed in purposes only as related to pertinency and knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.660" offset="4818004">The prosecutor went out of his way to tell the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.748" offset="4834408">Don't confuse the issue of -- for example, page 344 is an excellent example on what this really meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.235" offset="4868263">He said now, the purpose for bringing out whether or not Beck, Hoffa, Brennan or Dorfman or anyone else had a bad reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.516" offset="4897416">Isn't that so that it will reflect in anyway on the defendant or it shouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.672" offset="4918105">The reason as he goes on to show is that it would have a direct relationship to motive and as it had a relationship to pertinency itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.611" offset="5181837">I should point out that this was a mistake by the -- of court reporter at page 386 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.300" offset="5212557">The court reporter in a special -- in a special deposition in which both sides ask questions stated that beginning at line 21 of the record as the transcription reads, the purpose again in reading the testimony was not only to corroborate Mr. Sheridan's specific testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.692" offset="5282147">It should read the purpose again and this is the prosecutor saying, “Reading that testimony was not in any way to corroborate Mr. Sheridan's specific testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.215" offset="5324257">It was going to the question of pertinency and that alone.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1361.126" offset="5547865">There came a time when both sides presented requests to the court and the Government requested the court to decide as a matter of law that these documents were pertinent to the inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.750" offset="6014412">So here again, it is not -- not only should petitioner not be allowed to present this objection now before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.990" offset="6055372">But it seems to me that throughout the record itself, there is an indication of a calculated trial tactic of having this particular issue of pertinency, it precisely presented to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.609" offset="6113782">And why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.612" offset="6117857">Because petitioner obviously knew or could surmise that the judge would never have held that these documents were not pertinent to the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.401" offset="6164982">And so what did he have to lose?</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.964" offset="6171251">Indeed, he had everything to gain by allowing the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.394" offset="6184939">He could hope to capitalize on whatever confusion this would've presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.966" offset="6207195">In fact, this Court in Johnson versus United States, 318 U.S. stated, “We cannot permit an accused to elect -- to pursue one course at the trial and then when that has proved to be unprofitable to insist on appeal that the course which he rejected at the trial be reopened to him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.849" offset="6278771">And indeed, we go further and say that there could not have been any prejudice by having this issue submitted because as I will now indicate, these documents were in fact pertinent to this nature, to the subject matter of the inquiry as a matter of law, no judge -- no judge, a reasonable judge could possibly find that they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.232" offset="6384306">And as a result, what actually happened was that the Government had one more obstacle to overcome in order to convince the jury that petitioner Presser had obstructed the lawful inquiry of the Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1623.488" offset="6597360">And mind you, if one reads the briefs and especially the reply brief of petitioner, this issue of presenting the issue of pertinency to the jury is not really prop -- it's not even a question before this Court properly speaking and it was not raised, question as one on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.106" offset="6699760">It is brought in within the context of whether -- in the whole context of whether that Senator McClellan's testimony was admissible and then he goes into the discussion of pertinency and goes into the question whether pertinency should've been submitted to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.568" offset="6769664">Now, we don't of course base our argument on that, whether it was or was not raised before this Court as proper question in certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.041" offset="6799548">But it -- it's interesting that it is almost a -- an afterthought or it's riding on an objection which petitioner seems to indicate is more important whether the McClellan's testimony was admissible at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.116" offset="6867884">Therefore, in the absence of objection especially under the circumstances of this -- of the relationship of pertinency to knowledge and so on, I do not think that one could really say it was an error for the judge to have exercised his broad discretion in allowing the jury to decide this issue especially in the absence of objection from petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.824" offset="6970702">And I suppose we do come to this question, although the Government doesn't consider it a serious question, whether indeed the documents were pertinent to the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.193" offset="7012185">I think perhaps it might help to under -- to know what was the scope of McClellan investigation as I -- first of all, McClellan Committee had been set up under resolution to conduct an investigation into criminal and other improper practices in labor management relations and to see whether there were any changes that had to be that our laws had to be changed in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.328" offset="7124720">And as we all know, the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosing Act was passed in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.991" offset="7151365">Now, as an integral part of this investigation, the McClellan Committee undertook an inquiry into the question of misappropriation and misuse of the union funds, both operating funds and welfare funds in order to enrich union officials or to influence political and public figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.626" offset="7249899">And it also inquired into the possible domination of various unions by people outside the labor movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.482" offset="7281351">Now, among the union's investigator was the Teamsters Union and among those specific inquiries which undertook with regard to the Teamsters and which is specifically relevant here was the relationship of Teamsters Union officials to racketeers or reputed racketeers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.876" offset="7350836">And secondly the relationship present and past between the Teamsters Union and former Senator George Bender who was set up as the head of the so-called Clean Up or Anti-Racketeering Committee which the Teamsters Union had set up in order to investigate purportedly the corruption and improper practices of its own officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="2271.308" offset="9188603">And of course, there can be no question either as to the evidence that Mr. Presser was indeed aware of what the Committee was doing and what it was after at pages 11 to 12 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.681" offset="9250147">We go into great detail summarizing the evidence then, that he did indeed have a very clear motive to destroy these documents because his relationship to any of these people named on the doc -- in the documents, in the invoice and so on would what have a direct bearing as to his whole role with respect to certain -- respect to the practices in the Teamsters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.851" offset="9358817">And finally, there certainly was clear evidence and indeed last Thursday when Mr. Justice Stewart asked whether there's any question that Mr. Presser had possession of these documents, there just wasn't any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.237" offset="9412315">And indeed when Presser attempted to raise an alibi, the alibi that during these four days, September 9th through 13th, he was in Washington conferring with Mr. Hoffa, the Government introduced testimony to show that on September 11th, September 10th and 11th, Mr. Hoffa put in person-to-person, long distance telephone calls to Cleveland to Mr. Presser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.388" offset="9516910">And Mr. Presser accepted these calls and discussed various matters for a period of time with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.317" offset="9544600">So there's no question that he was in Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.567" offset="9553690">That he attempted an alibi which failed and that he indeed have possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.986" offset="9571349">And therefore, though the evidence was certainly circumstantial that he in fact defaced, mutilated the document or withheld it, it was pretty clear in light of the motive and all the other evidence --</text>

            <text syncTime="2396.701" offset="9690154">But essentially, the pertinency of the specific inquiries to the general investigation, secondly the pertinency of the documents to the subject matter of the invest -- of the particular inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.716" offset="9738219">Thirdly the knowledge of the petitioner and as far as the knowledge is concerned to be sure Senator McClellan couldn't say, “Well, I know for a fact the petitioner knew this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.629" offset="9773850">But what he did testify to is whether various matters of the Committee were public knowledge that the -- there -- that the unions had been put on notice that they were in -- that the Committee was investigating various things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.031" offset="9851486">And I suppose to try and prove the element of knowledge, you first have to show at least what it was knowledge -- of what it was knowledge and -- and so that McClellan's testimony did -- Senator McClellan's testimony did go to knowledge in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.732" offset="9914284">And ultimately, certainly did testify to motive of petitioner because by merely stating what the -- what the nature of the inquiry was by stating what the nature of these particular documents were, and what Mr. Hoffa's promised has been as far as cleaning up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.466" offset="9985233">Certainly, one can infer motive and then later on of course when Mr. Presser himself testified he admitted knowledge of various things which we point out at pages 11 to 12.</text>

            <text syncTime="2515.170" offset="10164015">Now his only specific objections were three in number that it was unnecessary for the Senator to testify with respect to the committee's authorizing resolutions because those documents, "spoke for themselves."</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.128" offset="10215842">That's at record page 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.532" offset="10225455">Secondly that the testimony beyond the authorizing resolutions was self-serving and that's at page 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.957" offset="10255235">And thirdly, that any testimony as to information concerning Senator Bender which the Chairman had received was hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.545" offset="10281566">That's at pages 31 and 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.819" offset="10290657">And of course, these were answered by the -- by the Committee for example with respect to this hearsay, to be sure it was hearsay but the importance was not whether in fact it was true but how -- what was the impetuous be -- behind the Committee's decision to start investigating the relationship of Bender to the Teamsters Union and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.693" offset="10538193">Well, certainly it isn't clear error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.187" offset="10544149">It was far from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.960" offset="10547179">It was hardly prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.351" offset="10556792">It was the type of thing that he would have -- perhaps even more prejudice if the judge made the decision because they were as a matter of law pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.608" offset="10589811">So, as far as Senator McClellan's testimony, we don't believe there really is any question as to admissibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.123" offset="10623875">Perhaps, in all candor, can I say, there was an instance, the Sheridan testimony, in which the Senator read from Sheridan's testimony and this is objected to by petitioner because he said this corroborated Sheridan's subsequent testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.202" offset="10696182">But first of all when she point out that the court and the prosecuting attorney over and over again said to the jury, “Mind you, this is not for corroboration, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.160" offset="10748008">We're trying to show that Mr. Schaffer”, who was the investigator, “Had authority to go to Cleveland to carry on this investigation in relationship with Bender."</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.302" offset="10784580">Then he had authority to examine documents that in fact it -- and it also goes to the Committee's interest in and its knowledge of what precisely happened at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.420" offset="10829093">Now, perhaps it's true that per -- this testimony need not have been read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.513" offset="10849468">But the fact that it was read within the -- it seems to me is not prejudicial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.902" offset="10867022">Especially one should note that in all essential respects, Sheridan's testimony and Presser's testimony as to the -- what happened during those -- that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.094" offset="10919790">The first visit on the 9th and the second visit on the 13th that they essentially were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.238" offset="10940374">Oh, they disagreed as to for example whether Sheridan -- whether Presser refused to give it because he wanted the documents Photostated or whether he wanted a receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.265" offset="10984469">But that wasn't the essential thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.776" offset="10990425">The important thing was that Sheridan went there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.655" offset="11002023">That he asked to see the documents that Presser indeed allowed him to see the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.443" offset="11017174">That when he requested the documents for some reasons or other, Presser said, “Could you come back at another time?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.343" offset="11044760">And Sheridan said, “Yes, I'll return within a few days.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.243" offset="11056358">And during that period of time, the documents were destroyed.Corroborate if anything, Sheridan corroborated Presser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.822" offset="11082689">Presser corroborated Sheridan as to the essential points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.011" offset="11095437">And since there was careful admonition that McClellan, Senator McClellan's testimony relating to Sheridan had no corroborative effect, I should think it would not have been error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.383" offset="11148936">It should have -- it should've been within his broad discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3455.869" offset="13926797">I suppose the real reason is because in many instances the people who do in fact obstruct a Committee inquiry obstructed in the course of the testimony so that instead the Congress cites them for contempt and these cases therefore arise here under the contempt statute rather than under the obstruction of the Committee inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="4536.250" offset="18248391">There are a few things that I like -- would like to correct, the -- the statements of the Solicitor General on and that is with respect to these two subpoenas that he had mentioned or had made some reference to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.379" offset="18320906">There is only one subpoena involved in this case and that's the one that was served on the petitioner in March.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.883" offset="18346924">Now, there is a reference through cross-examination of Sheridan to another one which was signed in April.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.909" offset="18375032">But as to that particular subpoena when he was asked if that had been prepared (Inaudible) in Cleveland, he was quite definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.919" offset="18431039">And on page 89 of the record, he says that -- he said that I say that it was prepared in Cleveland so that the reference that we are making some issue out of a subpoena that was in all respects or in some respects invalid and is against another which was in the -- executed in the same way, but which we do not make any issue to is an incorrect statement of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.565" offset="18565622">I think another thing that has -- has bothered me throughout this appeal is that the Government consistence upon referring to Mr. Presser as making an alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.383" offset="18624867">He did take a stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.660" offset="18634062">He corroborated Sheridan in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.704" offset="18646183">He testified that Sheridan left his office before he did on September the 9th.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.702" offset="18678157">There was some as -- some point of differences to one he returned, but he -- in any event, he returned on September the 12th and Sheridan did not return until September the 13th.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.365" offset="18728835">So in any event the -- on September the 9th and the 13th, the petitioner was in his office when Sheridan was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.666" offset="18778049">There was never any attempt to make an alibi in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.839" offset="18810755">I think that the statement that the matters were pertinent as a matter of law and therefore, the petitioner's failure to state to the court specifically that such matter should be sought evidence on pertinency should be heard outside the jury cannot be sustained on the basis of Braden as cited by the Solicitor General because in the Braden case which was the converse, the failure to object was not taken as the conclusive factor for the Court's decision on that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.917" offset="19062993">And in this case, the enumerable objections cannot be taken as nullities because the Court did in many cases recognize exactly what the objection was for.</text>

            <text syncTime="5095.682" offset="20486144">And it -- it begins on page 42 where the objections were taken and the Court originally sustained the defendant's objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.780" offset="20526477">The middle of 42, the Court says, “Objection sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.812" offset="20538598">I don't' see what materiality it has.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.661" offset="20549987">The prosecutor then went into this statement as to why he wanted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.715" offset="20570258">The Court not satisfied yet said, “Was it a matter that one official gave another official a Champagne Bucket?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.734" offset="20614353">At that point, the Senator recognized the problem and said it's a question of union -- using union dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.893" offset="20654895">Then the Court for some incongruous reasons said you may continue and he then characterized these names.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.868" offset="20690840">And you will see also at 257 that the reason for overruling the objection, objection on cross-examination was because the name was on -- one of the names was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.784" offset="20782477">One -- one more thing before I closed, I ‘d like to -- I'd like to mention that Bender was under a personal subpoena by the Government at the time and spent his time in the hall of the court, but was never called.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.464" offset="20841200">I'd also I like to mention that on September the 9th, Sheridan had the documents which are the subject of this lawsuit in his hands and could have taken them by giving a receipt which was then the custom and practice of the Field Office and Joint Council 41 but refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.488" offset="20953318">The entire -- the entire financial record of Joint Council 41 pertaining to these gifts was in the hands of the field office on September 9th 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.368" offset="21028864">I think of significance is that the subpoena which the petitioner has been accused of violating was issued six months before the document involved here was demanded and he was not charged, not indicted till six months following and that the documents involved were not -- and this is in the record, were not turned over to any department other than Sheridan's custody as appears until November 18th of 1958, approximately three months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.770" offset="21162402">Thank you for the court's attention.</text>
