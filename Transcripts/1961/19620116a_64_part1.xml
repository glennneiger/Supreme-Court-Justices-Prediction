            <text syncTime="69.351" offset="380740">The petitioners were brought to trial before Judge Wyzanski in the United States District Court of Massachusetts which had jurisdiction to try the defendants and jurisdiction over the offenses charged.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.621" offset="641860">As I recall, the record doesn't show it, Mr. Justice Brennan, but I think it took one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.543" offset="669550">Judgment of acquittal was entered the day after Mr. Judge Wyzanski freed the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.523" offset="705494">About 45 days later, the Government petitioned for a writ of mandamus from the United States' Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.014" offset="755440">For the first time in the history of Anglo-American jurisprudence, the court below issued a writ of mandamus vacating a judgment of acquittal in a criminal proceeding and directing that petitioners be tried again for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.656" offset="841958">It is our position, sirs, that the constitution, statutes, and judicial decisions make it clear that there can be no review of a judgment of acquittal by an appellate court, whether by appeal, mandamus, or in any other form.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="205.182" offset="924087">That is in the federal courts?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Arthur Richenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="206.558" offset="929625">Yes, sir, in a double jeopardy jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.433" offset="945089">We have taken the position and argued extensively in our briefs that the Government has no right of appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act and cannot utilize a writ of mandamus to bring up for review a verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.320" offset="1012694">We have set out the history of the Criminal Appeals Act and the cases showing the congressional and judicial hostility to the use of mandamus to circumvent the lack of a right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.037" offset="1067551">It is our position that a judgment of acquittal, once ended by a court that has jurisdiction over the parties and over the cause, may not be inquired into and petitioners may not be brought to the Bar again.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.652" offset="1129932">The way we understand the law, it is unnecessary for any inquiry to be made into the expressed or unexpressed reasons of why an acquittal was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.746" offset="1182386">And particularly as this so, where no question is raised as to the good faith of the district judge, it's for this reason that we ask the Court's indulgence and I'm not setting forth at this point of our argument a detailed statement of the facts which we shall attempt to go into, in answer to the Government's arguments, if time permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.591" offset="1281755">There is and can be no case cited by the Government as valid for the proposition that an acquittal can be vacated and the defendants try it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.365" offset="1332851">One of the maxims in our common law heritage is that an acquittal entered is forever a Bar to further prosecution for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.170" offset="1372035">This, we believe, is of itself significant in the hundreds of years of criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.597" offset="1405785">This fundamental concept that an acquittal is sacred and inviolable is so strong that obviously, it is not surprising, that the question has not often been raised in an appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.576" offset="1461687">There is no decision to parallel the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.938" offset="1495124">It is significant, however, that in the two cases where the Government has raised this question, one in this country and one in England, the Government's contention has been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.846" offset="1554787">We specifically direct the Court's attention to the decision of the unanimous bench in United States versus Weissman, which was decided in 1924 by Mr. Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.406" offset="1621034">In that case, the District Court directed a verdict of acquittal prior to the submission of any evidence, no witnesses before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.605" offset="1661785">It was, in effect, a discharge of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.887" offset="1686967">By writ of error, the Government raised before this Court the same issues it is raising today, that that trial was no hearing and that the trial, in effect, was a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.855" offset="1762826">Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for unanimous court, affirmed the principle that once a defendant is before a properly constituted court which has jurisdiction of the defendant and the cause and a judgment of acquittal has been entered, nothing could be done to set aside such an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.780" offset="1846523">As we read United States versus Weissman, the only facts that are pertinent are that the court had jurisdiction of the party and the cause and a verdict of acquittal entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.192" offset="1900126">Under that decision, we respectfully submit the appellate inquiry should end.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.072" offset="1927711">It is significant, Your Honors, that United States versus Weissman was not even referred to in the majority opinion in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.121" offset="1975881">Now, I ask the Court's permission to explore in detail a very important English case which is on all force with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.210" offset="2024260">In the Weissman case, the issue came before this Court on a writ of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.226" offset="2044322">In the English case, it came up exactly in this form by writ of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.447" offset="2069191">I refer to a decision decided by the Queen's Bench in 1952 entitled Regina versus Middlesex Justices.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="501.278" stopTime="503.095">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="501.278" offset="2108479">Is that cited in your brief?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_richenthal" startTime="503.095" stopTime="899.343">
            <label>Mr. Arthur Richenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="503.095" offset="2115793">Yes, it's cited in the briefs, and particularly in the individual petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.026" offset="2143483">In that case, the trial court directed a verdict of acquittal after the opening by the Crown, and prior to the submission of any evidence, the court told the jury it had read pretrial depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.871" offset="2246823">The record reveals that the judge had been exposed to three pretrial depositions, one from the policeman who arrested the defendant, who incidentally have been charged with drunk in driving, and he said he saw the car weaving in and out, go on the opposite side of the road, and hit the curve, a disinterested witness who has been driving at the back of the car, in effect, said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.203" offset="2352149">A doctor who examined the defendant shortly after he had been arrested said he had been intoxicated, and attached to the doctor's deposition were some handwritten statements of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.072" offset="2415679">The trial judge said that from the handwritten statements, he concluded, that the defendant had not been driving while drunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.780" offset="2450474">Incidentally, those statements of an educated man indicated a misspelling of his street and of his town.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.648" offset="2493942">The Crown felt that this was a very important case and took the appeal by writ of man -- took -- brought it up by writ of mandamus because they had no right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.055" offset="2543574">And, the Queen's Bench excoriated the lower court judge but held it could not and would not go and back of the verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.884" offset="2594879">Now the Government, apparently, recognizes the significance of the Middlesex Justice case because it takes four pages of its brief and attempts to distinguish it, but I respectfully submit that such distinction is without any validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.646" offset="2661961">They try to say that in the Middlesex case, the judge dismissed, I quote, “With knowledge of the facts of the prosecution's case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="652.406" offset="2712952">And Judge Wyzanski dismissed, quote in italics, “Without knowledge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="660.205" offset="2744195">I bring to this Court's attention that when Mr. Judge Wyzanski dismissed, he had had eight days of trial and 600 pages of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.909" offset="2782960">He had had colloquies with counsel at the Bench who had explained their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.538" offset="2801560">Prior to the commencement of the case, he had a motion to dismiss the indictment, he had motions for bill of particulars, he had bills of particulars filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.038" offset="2843564">Certainly, Judge Wyzanski had full knowledge of the prosecution's case when he made this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.185" offset="2876061">On the issue before the appellate court, we submit, once a verdict of acquittal has been entered, it is unnecessary whether the judge is familiar or not familiar with what the Government intends to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.760" offset="2934366">And the Middlesex decision does not go on the content of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.522" offset="2949413">They went out of their way to excoriate the judge and for that reason, it pointed out that though he said he had read the depositions, it was fairly obvious that he have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.534" offset="2997478">We submit, sir, that the risk of error or impropriety of what the judge has done must be borne by the Government once it has had an opportunity to appear before a court which has jurisdiction of the parties and the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.438" offset="3073128">Now, it is obvious that this background of non-reviewability lies not only in the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge and the lack of any right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.622" offset="3129866">But in the principle of the Fifth Amendment, petitioners are entitled to the full protection of that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.517" offset="3165393">There is no question that these defendants were in jeopardy in the first trial in front of Judge Wyzanski.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.595" offset="3197785">One need only have seen Fong Foo who lost 15 pounds during the 13 days and heard the outburst of tears of Knupp and Foo when Judge Wyzanski told them that they were free and that their bail was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.645" offset="3257971">No matter what label is put upon the action of the trial judge, realistically, these defendants have now been placed in second jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.599" offset="3317739">I would like to read a very relevant quote from this Court in United States versus Ball, one of the leading double jeopardy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.498" offset="3365386">“The verdict of acquittal was final and could not be reviewed on error or otherwise without putting the defendant twice in jeopardy and, thereby, violating the constitution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="832.479" offset="3433305">By this mandamus, if sustained, the Government has obtained in the appellate court that which the lower court refused to give them, an acquittal, that which -- I missed the trail, excuse me, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.424" offset="3513031">The Government tries to utilize this Court's opinion in the Gori case as a basis for supporting the Court of Appeals' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.450" offset="3565171">As we read the Gori case, the rationale of that is that a trial judge should be free to exercise its most sensitive judgment for the more effective protection of the criminal accused, and there is a basic distinction between the Gori case and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.945" offset="3659107">The trial judge in the Gori case intended a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.984" offset="3679274">Here, the trial judge intended to free the defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.197" offset="5388204">And even they are compelled in their briefs to admit that the judge can direct a verdict of acquittal prior to their putting in their full case where an essential fact in the judge's view, whether erroneously or not, has not been made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.991" offset="5487365">Now, we submit here that an essential part of the Government's case was not made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.022" offset="5527489">In their opening statement, they told the jury and the court that they would have to understand the testing of the device involved before getting to the question of whether there had been fraudulent testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.848" offset="5594781">Now, this Court must -- should understand that the device involved is a complicated electronic device called a radiosonde which is dropped from a plane by a parachute and, as it passes through the air, returns to a receiver by Morse code the temperature, the humidity, and the pressure of the air as it's going down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.732" offset="5714317">The Government made it absolutely clear, and I've read -- refer to page 70 of the record, that the first part of its case would be an explanation of this complicated device and it put on the stand Mr. Paliotto, who was the principal witness for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.156" offset="5799999">The record reveals he had been the chief inspector at the defendant corporate plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.457" offset="5821210">He had designated the tests which were involved in the indictment and evaluated them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.092" offset="5843780">He had personally initiated the FBI investigation and he personally had custody of the tapes which allegedly embodied the false testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.314" offset="5892577">His testimony was technical and difficult to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.650" offset="5909922">He admitted he had difficulty explaining that as to lay people even though he was a Government inspector at the defendant plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.995" offset="5947329">The judge's vigilance was particularly provoked at the commencement of the second day of trial by Mr. Paliotto description of a test operation as resulting in spurious marks on a piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.033" offset="6011486">When questioned by the judge, he explained that spurious meant instantaneous, on the spur of the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.189" offset="6052133">The judge cautioned the witness on the use of such language in criminal cases involving fraudulent testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.403" offset="6084942">Further on that day, Mr. Paliotto identified the document as prepared by an agent of the company which turned out to be a Government inspector's worksheet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.423" offset="6133112">The judge ordered and I quote, “This misleading exhibit to be taken from the jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.701" offset="6158190">At this stage, it was a Friday, the judge told the Government that he would be compelled to take, “drastic action if the case were not better prepared in connection with the technical matters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.299" offset="6220570">Thereafter, on further testimony, when the case reconvened after the weekend, Mr. Paliotto came up with inconsistent and contradictory statements on very important matters, such as the destruction of his notes on his activities as an inspector and the date of destruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.348" offset="6304789">And then, the most important incident arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.439" offset="6325164">He admitted and changed his testimony that he had actually destroyed the tapes which embodied the false testing and that such destruction took place after the commencement of the criminal investigation which he had invoked by going to the FBI and this, in light of a promise on the record by the Assistant U.S. Attorney, that the defendants would have the test tapes available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.929" offset="6447104">It was when this contradictory testimony came out on the fifth day that Mr. Justice Wyzanski called the U.S. Attorney to the bench and recommended to him that on this record this case should be nolle pros.</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.269" offset="7208417">With this witness, there was a change of vital testimony with respect to test cards and conversations with respect to dealing with the test cards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.029" offset="7307473">The witness Rosenholm testified to a conversation with company counsel and placed the conversation in February 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.930" offset="7351045">The indictment charges a conspiracy from September 1956 to November 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.656" offset="7390020">When attorneys for the defendant raised a question of lawyer-client privilege, the attorneys had a colloquy at the bench and defended -- the Government's counsel explained that this was a key conversation and that it was through the knowledge of the attorney for the company that they were going to attribute knowledge to the corporation and it was an essential part of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.224" offset="7496286">The judge saw many problems arising under the lawyer-client privilege and declared a recess to give the U.S. Attorney an opportunity to lay the proper basis to get this evidence in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.148" offset="7611956">He then changed the date of this key conversation to September 1957 and placed it directly in the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.276" offset="7656469">On cross-examination later that day, defendant's counsel brought out that out of the courtroom, the Assistant U.S. Attorney had refreshed the recollection of the witness Rosenholm for the changed date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.181" offset="7748106">The judge, in our opinion, very properly told the Assistant U.S. Attorney that such change should have taken place with the witness on the stand in the presence of the court, jury, and defendant's counsel.</text>
