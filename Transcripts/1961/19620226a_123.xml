            <text syncTime="32.801" offset="234559">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it – may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="39.250" offset="260368">The first argument, which I would set forth to this Court, I would divide into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.218" offset="300283">I feel, since this is basically a question of obscenity, I feel the first point that I must cover is strictly factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.957" offset="347199">You have four magazines before the Court and just a question of looking at these magazines as judges to see whether in the opinion of the Court, these magazines would revoke to the Court's definition, as laid down by Mr. Justice Brennan for the Court in its opinion in Roth versus United States.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="91.234" offset="468302">This was not a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.344" offset="476766">This is an exclusion from the mail case, is it not?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="96.100" offset="487737">This, Mr. Justice, is a civil case based upon a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.036" offset="519502">It is not criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.786" offset="526503">It is exclusion from the mails under the provisions of Title 18 1461 saying, “All obscene material is non-mailable.”</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="119.790" stopTime="128.651">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="119.790" offset="582510">And then -- and then the same statute proceeds to make a criminal offense and make it a criminal offense for anybody who does mail it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_m_dietz" startTime="128.651" stopTime="503.496">
            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="128.651" offset="617932">The same statute continues to place a penalty of five years imprisonment or a fine upon anyone who uses the mails to transit of obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.107" offset="671848">And I think that you will find in the Government's briefs some argument even to the point that it wou -- it would be even a crime for the postman to carry it, according to their interpretation which I don't agree with the Government's brief, but looking at the individual exhibits, I have gone over each one, each page as indicated in the record from the testimony given by the Government's doctors and I have covered it very fully in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.423" offset="805073">The first exhibit manual, April 1960 issue, the psychiatrist for the Government testified as to 16 bad pages out of possibly 48, one-third of the total context in the second exhibit, six out of 48 pages were covered, in the third, five out of 48 and in the last exhibit only four out of 48.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.286" offset="932551">Now, in the Government's brief, they have outlined nearly something that they feel is wrong or revolting to the statute of -- in nearly every page.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.488" offset="977272">I cannot go along with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.935" offset="983124">I say that if this was so then this was something that psychiatrist should have testified to and not the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.066" offset="1023666">This brings us to a question of just what is meant by this Court in its definition in the Roth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.607" offset="1065775">The Post Office has picked it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.625" offset="1073821">As I understand it, the definition says that as to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material considered as a whole must appeal to the prurient interest and the Government would argue that it's not to the average person.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.503" offset="1161383">I think they argue even further to this Court that this Court did not, in its opinion, intend to mean that obscenity must be judged on its effect upon the average person but only upon the average reader that is expected to receive or be the recipient of this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.830" offset="1266709">In the Post Office, they have changed this definition or this test of obscenity that this Court has laid down to one in which material is obscene if it would appeal to the prurient interest of a homosexual because they contain this material is deemed act homosexuals and only produced for homosexuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.752" offset="1386350">Of course this is one point that I would gladly argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.727" offset="1402232">We contend these magazines, if you examine them and see by volume, if nothing more the context is not for homosexuals, but is basically for the body builder, the person who is interested in large muscles and you may view each and every photograph in the magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.865" offset="1502856">But this brings us to the second consideration, just what is this so-called homosexual audience?</text>
            <text syncTime="357.728" offset="1534307">What are they composed of?</text>
            <text syncTime="359.489" offset="1541308">I argue in my brief and to this Court that this is the word itself, homosexual is incorrectly used, homosexual, the word, the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.449" offset="1601181">This does not describe people.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.893" offset="1610898">This is a term that describes things that people do and therefore, the way that it's used by the Post Office, itself, makes a definition inherently vague and indefinite.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.239" offset="1680280">I would continue with comparison of the definition as used in the Post Office with the definition as laid down by this Court in the Roth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.936" offset="1755094">Now, in the Roth case, this Court has said that we must apply contemporary community standards in judging material that is supposedly obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.024" offset="1807444">Now, that -- that is a catch phrase to me, contemporary community standards because the Post Office would say that this material is headed from homosexuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.994" offset="1847359">Well, who is there to testify as to the average audience that's homosexual, then what is the community standards for homosexuals?</text>
            <text syncTime="448.475" offset="1897305">Do they have any community standards?</text>
            <text syncTime="450.710" offset="1906186">Are we going to allow these second class citizens to receive any literature?</text>
            <text syncTime="455.574" offset="1925622">This is a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.802" offset="1934608">The Post Office will have this divide Americans into normal people, so-called normal people, even though their doctor says, there's no such thing as a normal person just within normal limits, normal people or abnormal people.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.185" offset="2000123">Now, for normal people, you receive one type of literature and that's the only thing that's allowed to be carried through the mails, and anything that does not fall into this category, anything that's going to appeal to this so-called abnormal people is obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.248" offset="2068355">I say, this is censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.222" offset="2108270">I would go further with this argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="503.496" stopTime="521.192">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="503.496" offset="2117360">In this argument, that the (Inaudible) specifically statutory is bias of homosexuality's are criminal standards or (Inaudible) homosexuality's standard?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_m_dietz" startTime="521.192" stopTime="587.944">
            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="521.192" offset="2188100">Perhaps, I did not make my argument clear, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.118" offset="2203878">My point was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.004" offset="2211401">If we take our definition as laid down in the Roth case, judging the material as a whole applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme upon the average person, the effect upon the average person, alright?</text>
            <text syncTime="547.832" offset="2294680">The Post Office change at around say, it's not the average person, it's not the average normal person, it's a homosexual, alright?</text>
            <text syncTime="556.367" offset="2328848">Now, can we find a so-called average homosexual?</text>
            <text syncTime="560.584" offset="2345671">The answer is no and this is in the record from the Government doctor's own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.588" offset="2377749">So therefore, you might have to say that anything that is going to appeal to a homosexual, by the definition given out from the Post Office, has got to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.131" offset="2423933">There's no -- there's no out.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.687" offset="2442115">Have I been able to make it any clearer?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="587.944" stopTime="643.816">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="587.944" offset="2455176">That's alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.305" offset="2464580">(Inaudible) as to the matter is that the (Inaudible) as the matter is (Inaudible) says that this (Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_m_dietz" startTime="643.816" stopTime="705.358">
            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="643.816" offset="2678680">I would best attempt to answer that question by saying that in the opinion of this counsel, there is no community that has no homosexuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.547" offset="2721520">That every community has and possibly they're not, I've -- and I stated in my brief, possibly it hasn't been -- maybe they haven't been discovered if you want to use that term, discovered because we keep these people suppressed so maybe they have been (Inaudible) it out and brought to the light.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.731" offset="2790275">Now, if you're going to -- the only other way that I could answer would be in the testimony given by the Government's doctor in this case as to all of the different, myriads of different things that would appeal to the prurient interest of the different phases or types of people that he would classify as homosexuals and I would say that's impossible by his own testimony to set any standard.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="819.390" offset="3380955">I hadn't -- I hadn't really reasoned it that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.088" offset="3395688">My reasoning had stopped at the point where you say there's one group of deviants but within this particular group there is by the testimony of the Government's own doctor, there were so many different segments that there is no person, no one or no group of persons, even Professor Kinsey and his group cannot say what is going to be the stimulant to or what would be the standards for arousal of the average of that group, that's where I stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.386" offset="3516897">You went a little bit further.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.856" offset="3546781">Let -- let's accept for a second just for argument, let's accept the Government's view then I have to ask the Court to again go back to the exhibits and examine them carefully, in conjunction with the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.323" offset="3616684">These photographs contained, if they were intended for homosexuals and I argued this in my brief that these photographs, none of which shows the completely exposed genital area.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.334" offset="3692753">In all of these photographs the genitalia is draped or covered and these photographs are not worst then, what we so-call normal people called pin-up photographs, which, I think, even this Court would take judicial knowledge, as generally commonly accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.680" offset="3786062">You see photographs of such beauty, female beauties as Marilyn Monroe nude on calendars, on walls all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.141" offset="3835904">Now, my argument to this Court, if you're going to consider that these photographs were headed for homosexuals, to appeal to homosexuals then an analysis of these photographs would show that these photographs are no more than the photographs comparable pin-up photographs of Marilyn Monroe and the other beauties.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.034" offset="3927542">And my point, in that argument being this, if we so-called normal people, according to our law, are entitled to have our pin-ups then why shouldn't the second class citizens, the homosexual group, if you use that term, why shouldn't they be allowed to have their pin-up?</text>
            <text syncTime="978.903" offset="4018970">Their pin-up is certainly no worse and you -- you have to examine each one of these photographs, their pin-up is no worse than our pin-ups.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.496" offset="4069334">That is the -- that is the three parts of my first argument, first -- first point I raised in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.874" offset="4110817">The second point raised in the brief is this question following this Court's decision in Smith versus California, a question whether a publisher of a magazine or any sort of literature is held accountable for the actions of his contributing photographers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.883" offset="4214888">These magazines were held to be non-mailable on two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.032" offset="4235473">One is that they were obscene and two is that they were non-mailable because they gave information, supposedly where, how, from whom obscene material may be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.479" offset="4301302">My point is, and the record, I think, shows that the publisher of this magazine did everything reasonable to learn, to ascertain for himself just what materials, the contributing photographers were selling and that he -- and the record also indicates that he voluntarily deleted from his magazines the advertisements of particular photographers whom he considered, in his opinion, were selling non-mailable photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.749" offset="4446333">The record will also show that he, himself, did not advertise any of his own particular completely nude photographs, which he was selling under his own trade name of Continental Artist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.682" offset="4518118">While I'm at that point, I would like to refer to something in the Government's brief which I feel should be brought to this Court's attention and that is appearing on pages 48, the bottom of page 48 and the top of page 49 of the Government's brief, where they allege that Mr. Womack was advertising his own merchandise in carrying an advertisement of Vulcan Studios, Tony of Vulcan Studios.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.640" offset="4705886">Everyone at the Post Office, from the postal inspectors through the hearing examiners, everyone that does have anything to do with Mr. Womack know that he was not Tony of Vulcan Studios that this Tony of Vulcan Studios is entirely different person and we feel that this should be brought to the Court's attention because it's just incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.511" offset="4805465">There's no -- there's no question that this is just an incorrect statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.101" offset="4843813">Now, in the -- in the record, the postal -- postal inspector, Harry Simon testified that he had extreme difficulty in purchasing anything that was supposed to have been obscene from the photographers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.814" offset="4914657">And the way that he, the postal inspector, would conduct his investigation would be to mail out what he called test letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.159" offset="4944018">Well, we did the same thing, that is the publisher of this magazine did the same thing and he even went further, and he expended more money than the postal inspectors did because he actually found materials that were not to his taste and he did delete those particular photos -- photographers from his magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.633" offset="5025938">Now, the third point that I have in this case is the question of whether there was a prior restraint exercised upon these magazines and that requires, in part a consideration of the regulations and in part a consideration of the time sequence and the way that these regulations were applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.219" offset="5136280">Now in the Government's brief, page 3, they have in their statement of facts, March 25th was the date that this material was placed in the mail by us, March 25th, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.374" offset="5204825">You'll notice that the next date is April 5th and April 5th was the date that we received the letter -- no, excuse me, April 5th is the date that the letter was dated that was supposedly mailed to us, informing us that this material was being held by the General Counsel of the Postal Office Department because they considered it to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.255" offset="5304404">I noticed in the rules of the Post Office that is supposed -- that is supposed to follow as set forth in the back of the page 81, it's in Appendix 8 to the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.306" offset="5416626">Rule 1 - Limitation, Rule 2 - Initiation because Rule 1 goes into the question of how much money is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.283" offset="5452466">Rule 2 on initiation it says, “Upon receipt of mail matter, of doubtful mailability, etcetera” referring to the provision of the code, “submitted by a postmaster, the General Counsel shall (a) file a complaint with the docket clerk.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.455" offset="5533236">Now, this material was stopped on the 25th of March, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.510" offset="5553403">April 5th is when we have received the letter stating that they feel that this material is non-mailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.660" offset="5594049">I say again, not we received, but when they supposed to have mailed the letter, April 5th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.330" offset="5612648">Now, April 11th, 1960, they have in their brief in the bottom of page 3 that we have challenged this letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.656" offset="5654026">We have filed formal complaint with the Post Office about it, but, we went further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.874" offset="5674820">On that date, April 11th, we received or we asked for and received the temporary restraining order from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and, of course, in the bottom of page 4, in the Footnote 1, the Government's brief says temporary restraining order was denied on April 13th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.404" offset="5773040">Well, this is a little bit of an error because the temporary restraining order was granted on the 11th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.281" offset="5792475">Now, what happened was two days later, on the 13th, we had a hearing on the preliminary injunction which was denied, giving us the right to come back to the Court, if we did not receive a hearing or to conclude a hearing by the 28th of that month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.612" offset="5869798">Now, the point that I -- I wish to raise with this Court and why this counsel feels that's important that these magazines are dated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.546" offset="5901563">Each one of these magazines had got a date on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.656" offset="5913997">Now, if they -- according to their rules, if they can take a magazine and keep it for 10 to 12 days before they are supposed to send you a letter saying that you're not going to be able to continue through the mails with this magazine before they even start in, the mechanism for having a hearing then by the time, this hearing is finally granted, if ever, your magazines are no longer saleable because the month has passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.694" offset="6118170">That was stopped the month before and they gave us this letter which said, “You can come and -- and get your materials and -- and withdraw it from the mails or you can go ahead and request the -- the hearing.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.687" offset="9866115">One that is, I suggest, the peculiarly insidious form of obscenity in that, while it appears to the average man to be far less objectionable than the usual forms of pornography in fact, it has far more serious effect upon its audience than ordinary pornography has on the average audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.481" offset="9949288">The leading commentators on obscenity and the law, Lockhart and McClure, have described this type of publication as the pseudo-physical culture magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.487" offset="9993279">With Court's indulgence, I should like very briefly to read their most apt description of this genre of publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.736" offset="10026297">“Although, not a Charles' Atlas magazine, they say, it would have appeared to the normal heterosexual male only as a rather bizarre magazine because of the unusual clothing worn by the muscular men pictured in its photographs and peculiar settings and props included in the photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.669" offset="10102053">Analyzed by a psychiatrist or a psychologist, however, the magazine took on an entirely different character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.254" offset="10132355">It was then seen for what it really was, a magazine for male homosexuals to whom the clothing, settings and props had symbolic meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.518" offset="10177494">Now, because of the character of the appeal of these magazines, these writers, Lockhart and McClure assumed that such material should be characterized as hardcore pornography.</text>

            <text syncTime="3214.462" offset="12961207">The testimony on the character -- characteristics and the impact of these publications was unusually comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.760" offset="12990464">The Government had two psychiatrists, one of which testified by stipulation only and one psychologist plus several lay witnesses and petitioner had one psychiatrist and one psychotherapist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.660" offset="13050023">The record that was produced by these witnesses makes it clear as to just what the intended and actual audience of these publications was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.825" offset="13086699">The record for example contained concessions by a petitioner's publisher.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.995" offset="13107388">I should point out he was not a witness, but evidence that he had admitted that they were designed for and that they were read primarily by homosexual males.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.977" offset="13155244">The Government expert, the psycholo -- the psychiatrist and the psychologist testified that the only possible explanation for these magazines considering the way in which they were setup was a purpose to appeal to homosexuals and they testified that in fact the primary audience within their experience would in fact be male homosexuals plus adolescents with some homosexual tendencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.173" offset="13276035">It was conceded -- I should also point out that these witnesses -- these expert witnesses also testified that these magazines would have no appeal to the average normal man and more particularly, they certainly would not appeal to the prurient interest of the average normal man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.212" offset="13360253">It was conceded not all sides offer that they would appeal to the prurient interest of homosexuals and this, I say, is specifically conceded by the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.908" offset="13411035">Now, I'm not going to go into detail concerning the testimony of the psychiatrist and psychologist concerning the significance of the various poses, costumes, props and arrangements in these pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.049" offset="13455548">We've set that out in some detail at pages 5 to 10 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.433" offset="13477073">I would, however, like to touch briefly upon the expert testimony concerning the impact of these magazines on their intended audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.637" offset="13513958">It's rather unusual in an obscenity case as you no doubt appreciate for there to be any sort of specific evidence as to the effect that pornography will have on its audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.991" offset="13567352">In the case of the average person, they just has not been establish clearly one way or the other that it does or does not have this effect or that and therefore, as I say it's particularly noteworthy that psychiatrists and psychologists were willing to come forward and testify as they did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.915" offset="13679052">I think it's fair to say that there was some disagreement on this -- in this record and I -- I will advert briefly to the extent of that -- that disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.613" offset="13721788">Now, there was testimony in -- in wi -- in light of which all of these facts have to be considered that homosexuals do have less adequate control over their reactions than do the normal person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.746" offset="13786363">The Government witnesses also testified that these magazines could very well stimulate practicing homosexuals to engage in overt and indeed in unlawful homosexual activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.164" offset="13840071">There was testimony that the magazines would induce adolescents with latent homosexual tendencies to become fixed in a pattern of homosexual behavior and as to both of these categories that is to say adult male homosexuals and adolescents with homosexual tendencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.423" offset="13921050">The testimony was that the reaction of these magazines would arouse in them would make it more difficult to treat and to cure them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.328" offset="13956681">Now, the -- there was not a significant difference of expert opinion on this -- on these various points to the extent that the defense psychiatrist and psychologist testified, I shouldn't say defense, the petitioner's psychiatrist and psychologist testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.148" offset="14051976">They merely said that magazines of this character could not turn one who had no homosexual tendencies into a homosexual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.463" offset="14089174">They also said that by and large pictures do not have a great effect on most homosexuals although, they admitted that to the extent that a homosexual is subject to any stress or that -- that he is unable to get any relief from -- from his drives that then they might have some effect on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.687" offset="14178095">Here again, we've endeavored to set out the divergence to the extent that there is any of this testimony in our brief, but I think it's fair to say that there was not, the -- this testimony that I referred to is not specifically attacked by the petitioner's experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.137" offset="14255940">The Government's expert also testified that the appeal to the prurient interest of homosexuals was the dominant theme of these magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.437" offset="14289168">Indeed, one of them testified that this was the only theme of these magazines and once one understands and appreciates the significance of the various costumes and poses and props in these pictures, this conclusion is fairly obvious just from looking at the magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.973" offset="14363251">The Government experts further testified that these magazines had no redeeming qualities of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.688" offset="14390105">For example, they were unable to find any sort of intention to express ideas or to advocate a point of view such as it's apparently the controlling consideration in this Court's decision in One Incorporated against Olesen and Sunshine Publications against Summerfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.872" offset="14466905">Now, the petitioner has contended in -- in this connection of redeeming qualities that these magazine are -- magazines are physical culture magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.063" offset="14511626">As I've indicated at least one commentator has characterized them as pseudo-physical culture magazines and I think it's relevant to notice the American Law Institute comment in the Model Penal Code that appeals to prurient interest should not escape condemnation merely because they circulate onto the banner of some cult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.909" offset="14591039">But in point of fact, again an examination of these publications will, I think, fairly clearly demonstrate that there is very little about them that suggests physical culture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.353" offset="14636805">One particular examper -- example I would cite is that the advertisements that appear in this magazine are invariably for photographs of males.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.858" offset="14674840">They -- they don't in any instance advertise physical culture equipment or weightlifting equipment or books as to how to improve your body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.824" offset="14726666">The Government experts specifically denied that these were physical culture magazines in their dominant theme and even the petitioner's experts testified as to the marked and critical differences between these publications and what we might recall to have been -- wha -- what we might have expected the publications of the Charles' Atlas and the Bernarr MacFadden's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.840" offset="14842755">For example, they noted that these magazines were notably lacking in --in text material contrary to these magazines of the past that -- and they noted as -- as a very critical distic -- distinction, the bizarreness and the fact that some of these would be wearing only shoes and that sort of -- that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.718" offset="14938258">They noted the general poor taste of the pictures that they say would not probably be found in the traditional physical culture magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.934" offset="14971068">They also pointed to something which is fairly unavoidable, if you examine the magazines, and that is that the great many of the models that appear have very undistinguished physiques.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.349" offset="15016730">On the basis of this testimony taken as a whole, the Judicial Officer of the Post Office Department found that the dominant theme of the magazines was an appeal to the prurient interests of the actual and intended audience of these publications, namely male homosexuals and adolescents with homosexual tendencies and that they were therefore obscene and non-mailable and the court's below, they both agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.173" offset="15124041">Now, this finding and its approval by the courts below, of course, assumed that obscenity is properly judged in relation to the average member of the audience of the publication and not the average person in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.684" offset="15186108">And we submit that this was clearly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.029" offset="15195512">Indeed, that this is the only test that is possible at the legislative ends of Congress in enacting this legislation and of the States generally in enacting obscenity legislation, are to be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.260" offset="15252459">It is almost universally recognized that the primary purpose of obscenity legislation is to ban material that may lead directly or indirectly to illegal or immoral conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.182" offset="15316093">Now, it seems plain that if we are to be concerned with the effect that this sort of material is to have on conduct, we must consider those who are exposed to it and hence maybe affected by it, not to some group that will not come in contact with it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.045" offset="15383594">The testimony in this case is, as I have indicated, that homosexuals will see and will be affected by this material whereas the average normal person by and large simply won't buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.398" offset="15440959">I should like the Court to consider the anomaly of applying the average normal adult standard to all material irrespective of its audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.353" offset="15496756">Under the average normal adult standard that petitioners are contending for, pornographic matter appealing to the prurient interest of normal adults can be kept from them in spite of the fact that in relation to abnormal people, they have better defenses against being affected by this sort of thing and furthermore as a general rule or I should say more often than not they have a lawful outlet for any desires that are stimulated by this material or at least they have an outlet that is less socially condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.141" offset="15639907">However, under the same average normal adult standard, pornographic matter deemed that's -- at the special tastes and interests of sexual deviants or of adolescents cannot be controlled in spite of the fact that is the evidence in this case, indicated they are more likely to be affected by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.995" offset="15715349">They have a lower threshold as far as the effect on them is concerned and that they do not by and large have as much of an available outlet for any -- any desires that maybe stimulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.817" offset="15774595">Thus, those most in need of protection against the pornography of the panders of pornography would be denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.972" offset="15811271">I suggest quite the contrary of what Mr. Dietz suggested -- in suggesting that homosexuals are made second class citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.809" offset="15846588">There is an analysis that I've gone through, it suggest that the average normal adult would be made second class citizen since he could be kept from pornography, but the homosexual could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.119" offset="15895803">Now, I do want to cover one point and that is that the adoption of the standard would certainly not be an adoption of the Hicklin Test where all material is to be judged by its effect on the most susceptible person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.042" offset="15951496">We're talking here about material that is aimed at a special audience, that is read by a special audience in matter, that this directed to the average audience as most material is and would of course be judged accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.386" offset="16004890">In view of this consideration, most of the enlighten commentators of today have urged that the -- that pornography, that obscenity be judged in terms of its audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.834" offset="16054732">And I will cite we've referred to in our brief simply the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, Lockhart and McClure, who are recognized as the leading authorities in this country on obscenity and the law and in addition, the English and their Obscene Publications Act of 1959 also adopted this standard at the urging of lea -- leading literary fi -- figures in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.437" offset="16157132">We submit further that this standard, judging material in relation to its audience, is entirely consistent with what this Court laid down as the definition of obscenity in the Roth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.566" offset="16205615">It's significant to note the trial court charge in Roth, which was approved by this Court, was articulated in terms of the effect upon all those whom it is likely to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.584" offset="16245739">And of course, in the Roth case, there was no contention that this -- the material in that case was aimed at anything but the general public and therefore, this didn't create any sort of stir but as I say that was in the Roth charge and in addition, in many of the cases cited by this Court in Roth, the standard of the audience to which the publication -- to which the material was directed was the standard used by the Court that we've set out in our brief in page 30 that some of those cases and the language that the Courts used in employing that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.069" offset="16403623">I think one further point that is rather important in judging the audience standard is that it has been rather persuasively argued that the adoption of an audience standard as oppose to an average adult standard is perhaps the key to intelligent, liberal and effective judging of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.483" offset="16493275">This is strongly urged by Lockhart and McClure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.058" offset="16507591">They point out, for example, that such standard would tend to protect works of some literary narrative such as for example, Lady Chatterley's Lover for magazines of some literary merit or ordinarily deemed and consumed primarily by people somewhat more sophisticated than the average normal adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.921" offset="16583032">On the other hand, employment of this standard does leave open the possibility of proceeding against the pander who goes into the schoolyard to purvey these very same books to young children in order to stimulate their sexual interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.546" offset="16649592">In short, we strongly urge that where the evidence shows the material was designed primarily for and consumed primarily by a special audience, its obscenity must be judged in relation to that audience and we further urge that in this case, the Judicial Officer and the courts below properly employed that standard in concluding that this material was non-mailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.059" offset="16743633">Now, if the Court's indulgence in order to make sure that I covered the prior restraint point, I shall not argue the second point in our brief and it's also the second point in the petitioner's brief concerning the second and independent basis for concluding that this material is non-mailable and that is, that it contained information as to where obscene material could be obtained that is, it primarily turns on the facts in both of the brief we've set out the fact in detail and I don't think that anything would be gained by argument on the point here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4255.461" offset="17125230">Well, we -- we believe and we've set out the facts on the basis of -- on which our belief is founded that the petitioners plainly had knowledge or at the very least were chargeable with knowledge of what their advertisers were putting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.979" offset="17191267">In the first place, they represent in three or four of these magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.492" offset="17209344">They represent familiarity with the work of their advertisers and urge the various subscribers to the magazine to send their money into these photographers for pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.972" offset="17267231">Secondly, the record is replete with evidence of the involvement of petitioner's publisher with purveyors of homose -- of -- obscenity among homosexuals including his offer to exchange what he calls sucker lists among the various other photographic studios, indeed his own conviction for sending obscenity through the mails such that it -- it defies credulity that he was not aware of what these various studios were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.870" offset="17386872">Furthermore, he was warned a number of times that the possibility that the material -- that his advertisers were sending obscene materials through the mail and finally, we suggest that if you just examine these advertisements themselves, you'll see that they rather strongly indicate that obscene material could be obtained just to suggest one example, one of the pictures has a -- one of the magazines in the advertisements has a picture of a young boy with the parts of the picture that would render it objectionable, very obviously retouched, very obviously removed and then the text below the picture offers “an original print of this photo” and is rather clear of what the advertiser had in mind in making that particular offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.469" offset="17617272">A contention is made and I shall devote the remainder of my argument to it that the procedures followed by the Post Office Department constitute a prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment in that the Postmaster General refused to carry these matters -- these magazines pending a determination of their mailability. After very briefly going through the procedure that was followed, I will argue that the procedure here was required by Congress and that it is not barred by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.373" offset="17740884">The procedures are set forth at the back of our brief and I've already indicated to some extent what they consist of.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.024" offset="17775470">I would like to add that in this case, a slight variation in the procedures was agreed upon by stipulation in order that they be expedited and I might say that the pro -- that the regulations which do require expedition at each stage of the proceedings expressly provide for waiver of any part of the procedure in order that they be moved along and here, by stipulation, the -- a hearing before a hearing examiner was waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.908" offset="17895006">Ordinarily, there's a hearing before a hearing examiner and then this is final unless it appealed to the Judicial Officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.498" offset="17921337">Here by stipulation, the hear -- the hearing was originally held before the Judicial Officer so that one stage of the proceedings was eliminated in order to complete the proceeding as quickly as possible.</text>
