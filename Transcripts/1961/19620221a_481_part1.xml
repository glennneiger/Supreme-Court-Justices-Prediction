            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="75.303" offset="404564">Now the -- as I stated, the facts are simple and without contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.545" offset="433507">This petitioner, Benny Lurk, was indicted, tried before a jury and convicted of the crime of robbery as defined in the District of Columbia Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.084" offset="495679">He was -- his trial was presided over and judgment was rendered against him by Judge Joseph R. Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.924" offset="539042">Trial took place on March 22, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.758" offset="558373">Now, Judge Jackson had then appointed to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.820" offset="590660">He sat on that court for more that 14 years and retired there from in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.530" offset="625455">Several years thereafter, began a series of assignments of Judge Jackson pursuant to Section 294 (d) of Title 28 of the U.S. Code which expressly permits and authorizes the assignment by the Chief Justice of the United States of judges, retired Judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to sit on District Courts around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.191" offset="728168">The particular assignment in question here and the one which covered the period during which petitioner's trial took place, delegated or authorized Judge Jackson to sit on the District Court for the District of Columbia for the entire year of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.786" offset="810506">And in that connection, it is important to note that the assignment made of Judge Jackson for the year 1960 did not designate him to sit as one of the -- or in place of any of the regular 15 judges composing the District Court of the United States, simply authorized him to fill an office so-called of the Judge of the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, an office which was created solely by virtue of the assignment, made pursuant to Section 294 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="217.968" offset="975287">And the petitioner's challenge in this case goes to the constitutionality of that statute which purports to authorize this office of District Judge of the United States by virtue of an assignment of a retired judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.709" offset="1046235">We, therefore, attacking the de jure as well the de facto in nature of this Judge's participation as a Judge of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.920" offset="1083016">And under these circumstances as we developed more fully and I reply brief in this case, the first defense offered by the Government in this case in terms of de facto doctrine is no answer to the challenge, the constitutional challenge made by petitioner in this case that no office could exist by virtue of an assignment under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.901" offset="1174967">Now, before I get to the heart of the constitutional issue, there are several preliminary considerations which I would like to submit, which I feel are critical to an understanding of that constitutional issue and which form the context within which this issue must be viewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.922" offset="1259081">Now, first such consideration is the fact that this petitioner is here alleging a personal constitutional right as an inhabitant of the District of Columbia to have his trial in the District Court, heard by a judge authorized to execute Article III judicial power and author -- and having the constitutional immunity or independence of action which Article III gives to judges of Article III courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.305" offset="1404635">And that to deny him that claim, that right, we suggest, is to deny this petitioner due process of law in his trial and conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.298" offset="1452596">Now, this personal claim of the petitioner, this personal -- (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="341.406" offset="1469001">Let me ask you.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.115" offset="1471822">If you're right, why do we have to bother about due process?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="345.513" stopTime="391.254">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="345.513" offset="1485406">Well, I think it -- it automatically follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.259" offset="1500453">The claim is Your Honor that the provisions of Article III, Section 1 relating to the independence of the federal judiciary in terms of salary and tenure of office are designed primarily, I suggest, for the protection of the litigants and the defendants who are called before Article III courts and they are not as this Court said in Evans against Gore and reiterated in the O'Donoghue case.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.223" offset="1652276">They are not a private grant to the judges themselves.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="391.254" stopTime="397.224">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="391.254" offset="1668368">Do you think the life tenure was put in the Constitution on due process consideration?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="397.224" stopTime="448.154">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="397.224" offset="1692296">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.867" offset="1694804">I think it was put in there primarily to -- as the Evans against Gore points out that in order to ensure that the guarantees and other provisions of the Constitution are properly administered and applied by the judges of Article III courts, that it was absolutely essential that the judges be given constitutional independence of action and they could only do that by giving them life tenure and by protecting them from any diminution in their compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.909" offset="1842970">Now, I think necessarily follows from that that the litigants and the defendants are entitled to that constitutional independence on the part of those who are sitting in judgment of them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="448.154" stopTime="454.608">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="448.154" offset="1895946">If there is no valid court, you don't have to bother about due process, do you?</text>
            <text syncTime="452.488" offset="1913292">You have to bring everything under due process.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="454.608" stopTime="643.531">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="454.608" offset="1921755">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.201" offset="1924159">I think it -- it is one way of expressing it but I think if there is no valid Article III court here or no valid Article III judge, that puts an end to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.944" offset="1967104">But I think that one way of saying that from another angle is simply that there's been no due process accorded him.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.273" offset="1996466">But I don't want to pursue that situation because I think as you say, the -- the complete answer is if I am right, law in the fact that this Judge was not authorized under the Constitution to sit in this case or to render judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.342" offset="2076714">In that respect, I submit further that it is no answer as the Government seems to suggest that Judge Jackson has life tenure by virtue of a congressional enactment in 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.276" offset="2144528">Whatever statutory protections of tenure or salary that Judge Jackson may have is no substitute for the constitutional requirements, the constitutional protection which can only be given to an Article III judge and simply because Congress is seen fit to give life tenure to a so-called non-Article III judge does not thereby satisfy the constitutional claim which I am here asserting, a claim which requires and necessitates that the life tenure and the protection against salary compensation diminutions come from the Constitution from Article III, Section 1 and not from any statutory enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.086" offset="2363747">And I might say that as I will develop later, that Congress in this instance has demonstrated an ability and a constitutional right to cut the salaries of judges such as Judge Jackson as they did in fact in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.159" offset="2443995">But moreover, this constitutional claim which petitioner is here asserting is one which very definitely can be raised and pursued by this petitioner as an inhabitant of the District of Columbia because the O'Donoghue case completely answers any contrary claim by demonstrating and ruling that District of Columbia inhabitants are not less fortified by the guarantee of an independent judiciary than in other parts of the union and that they too like the inhabitants of all the other 50 states, have the right to have their cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States heard and determined, I'm quoting, “By federal courts created under and vested with the judicial power conferred by Article III."</text>

            <text syncTime="650.258" offset="2704384">They did reach the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.337" offset="2712743">I'll be glad to examine into that at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.038" offset="2735522">Now, their answer to this claim which I am asserting, which is a constitutional claim by this petitioner, was that regardless of what might be said with respect to Article III of the Constitution, the complete answer is to be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.758" offset="2806366">They said in another section of the Constitution to with the district clause of Article I which is in Section 8 Clause 17 of Article I.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.766" offset="2846386">So they said, “We will avoid any determination of your claim under Article III because we feel that the complete answer is to be found under the District of Columbia Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.415" offset="2897063">Now, that District of Columbia Clause merely reads that the Congress shall have exclusive jurisdiction to legislate for the National Seat of Government or the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.529" offset="2949517">And it has been viewed as a rather plenary congressional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.228" offset="2972296">Well, be that as it may, the complete answer to the -- to the analysis rendered by the Court of Appeals below on that ground again is to be found in the O'Donaghue case in 289 United States, which demonstrates that that District of Columbia Clause is not to be read in a vacuum and it is not inconsistent with the application of Article III of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.675" offset="3094026">Moreover, this Court said in O'Donaghue, it is not to be used and I quote, “To destroy the operative effect of the judiciary clause namely Article III within the District of Columbia.”</text>
            <text syncTime="762.768" offset="3154422">Now, that means very simply this, that if petitioner is right in asserting that Article III of the Constitution prohibits this assignment and requires that this case be heard and determined by an Article III judge, then it is no answer to that claim that the District of Columbia Clause provides any type of an answer because the two clauses are in no way inconsistent and the District of Columbia Clause is not to be used to prevent the operative effect of Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.606" offset="3317844">In other words, both the District of Columbia Clause and Article III must be read together, both of them must be applied and if one of them namely Article III prohibits this assignment, that is the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.417" offset="3369044">There is nothing in the District of Columbia Clause which would override or make inapplicable the provisions of Article III.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.058" offset="6995571">Well, that brings us then again to the very heart of the constitutional issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.876" offset="7022843">And I start with the assumptions and the decisions rendered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.371" offset="7044890">With respect to the two tribunals which are in issue here and which must be compared, the Bakelite and the Williams cases decided that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was a legislative or Article I tribunal deriving no function or jurisdiction in its creation from Article III of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.219" offset="7180204">And on the other hand, we have the O'Donoghue case saying that while the District Court for the District of Columbia may be given certain non-Article III functions which are not in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.484" offset="7249272">It is primarily an Article III court created thereunder and endowed with all the powers and functions which are given to a -- to a court by Article III and its judges are endowed with the judicial independence which the first section of Article III gives to judges of Article III courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.205" offset="7352195">So therefore, we have posed very clearly, the basic question whether the judge of this legislative court as so described in the Bakelite and Williams cases can be assigned over to a constitutional court such as the district court below to pursue as to perform the Article III functions necessitated by the trial of a criminal case therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.185" offset="7500152">Now, I suggest Your Honors that this necessitates in the first place an understanding of what is meant by the judicial power of the United States as expressed in Article III and it called forth to be exercised in this proceeding in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.459" offset="7589177">And I suggest Your Honors that what Article III judicial power basically means is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.614" offset="7617808">That it is that function, that judicial function which cannot in anyway be delegated to or exercised by any other arm of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.577" offset="7669635">We get back here basically to a question of separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.833" offset="7686666">There is a certain core of judicial action and jurisdiction which is conferred upon the Article III tribunals and this District Court in particular which cannot be exercised by any other organ of the Government, be it administrative, be it legislative or executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.396" offset="7772975">Now, this seems to me to call forth the whole host of considerations that we normally associate with the courts of law and equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.458" offset="7825220">The -- what Justice Frankfurter has described in several occasions as jurisdiction over matters such as where the traditional concern of the courts at Westminster prior to the establishment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.513" offset="7881435">This calls forth the exercise of that judicial power over cases and controversies which involved the use of the federal rules or civil and criminal procedure which incorporate all the provisions of the jury trial system and which involved all the other traditional powers of equity and law, the substantive and procedural elements of Title 28 and Title 18 of the U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.800" offset="7998568">Those functions which by the very nature are so judicial in nature that they cannot be given by Congress to any other agency of the Government, and unless a court has that non-delegable power, the judicial power, which it alone can exercise, then it is not a court created under or exercising Article III judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.907" offset="8095013">And I suggest that the most outstanding example of that non-delegable power which is not susceptible of exercise by any other organ of the Government is this criminal proceeding instituted against this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.421" offset="8153004">It is inconceivable that this petitioner could have been tried and convicted by an administrative agency, by an Executive Department or by Congress itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.352" offset="8208802">This was something that was not susceptible of judicial determination other than by an Article III tribunal with all the traditional inherent powers that it alone can exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.907" offset="8270973">And this District Court has that power obviously and it did exercise it in this case, and it therefore necessitated that it have a judge qualified constitutionally to administer this Article III judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.862" offset="8338787">Now, I want to hasten to add an important qualification on this or an additional power which the District Court has here which I think has led to the confusion in this case, that Article III courts also have power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.538" offset="8409527">In addition to this core of non-delegable judicial power, they also have power to render judgments over cases and controversies which are equally determinable by other agencies of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.100" offset="8471803">Now, the Government's brief has emphasized and the all parties have emphasized very significant statement made over a hundred years ago in Murray's Lessee against Hoboken Land Company where Mr. Justice Curtis stated a very obvious and important consideration about the jurisdiction arising other than from Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.092" offset="8559783">And I quote, he said, “That there are matters involving public rights which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.666" offset="8606072">That means Article III judicial powers are capable of acting on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.131" offset="8623940">But which are also susceptible of judicial determination but which Congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States as it deems proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.556" offset="8669602">Now, this means and I suggest this comes from the very heart of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.362" offset="8684857">This means that there are functions under Article I of the Constitution given to Congress and in the execution of those powers are called forth certain judicial determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.011" offset="8747447">And in the -- said determining, how those determinations shall be made?</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.054" offset="8767613">Congress has a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.010" offset="8779421">It may withhold to itself the power to make those determinations as it has done in historically, involving claims against the United States, the power to pay the debts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.805" offset="8830621">It may withhold it to itself through private legislation or it may give it to an Executive Department to determine or an administrative agency or it may give it to a specialized tribunal such as the Court of Claims or it may also give it to an Article III court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3092.909" offset="12475016">Although it -- such power couldn't be vested to courts of the United States outside of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.948" offset="12507199">And therefore, when you deal with -- with specialized tribunal, you've got a problem different from the problem of the District Courts throughout the country which are vested in them all the jurisdiction that Congress sees fit to vest in federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.779" offset="13050441">And I don't think the fact that this District Court has certain nonjudicial functions can serve as a crutch to permit the assignment or the performance of this Article III function of a judge who by his service on the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals never required Article III functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4860.641" offset="19545945">I would like to emphasize at the beginning the importance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.670" offset="19574053">First, of avoiding, entangling it in broader constitutional issues than the case necessarily presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4877.304" offset="19612609">And second, of avoiding the difficulty which I found, I fell into very often and thinking about the case of dealing with abstractions, entangling niceties rather than what people do and what rights they may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.800" offset="19686588">Now, it seems that the only issue which has to be decided on the merits in this case is whether the Court which convicted the petitioner was, as I said a moment ago, legally constituted for the purpose of trying a local charge of robbery in the District of Columbia or to state that question conversely, it's whether the trial for criminal violation of the District of Columbia Code before a court known as the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, but presided over by a judge from the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals violated any of the petitioner's legal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.279" offset="19848443">I state of course in that fashion for a reason I indicated a moment so that we are much more likely to reach the proof, I think, by avoiding these undefined terms like judicial power of the United States, Article III court, legislative court, constitutional court, all which I suspect to give and shifting meanings throughout of the argument and instead pursuing to direct lines of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.898" offset="19978951">First, whether the authority of Judge Jackson to preside at the petitioner's trial can be traced back to an origin in the Constitution; second, if it can, then the question arises whether the power was exercised in a manner which violates any statutory or constitutional rights of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.560" offset="20081664">And this does involve, I think, looking at what was done in concrete and specific instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.730" offset="20110294">Here, there's no question about the validity of the assignment of Judge Jackson to sit in this Court, which was signed by the Chief Justice on December 7th, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.210" offset="20160240">The authority to make the assignment is derived from Section 293 of Title 28 of the United States -- United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.315" offset="20208619">But I would emphasize that although that general power to assign a judge of the Court of Claims or Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to any Circuit or any District originated in 1958, there was a particular power to assign a judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to sit in the courts of the District of Columbia, either the Supreme Court is it then was known, now the District Court or the Court of Appeals for the District and if that statute was enacted in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.379" offset="20344874">It was enforced at the time Judge Jackson was appointed to what was life tenure by the statute and he must have been appointed by the President, gratified and confirmed by the Senate with a view to that possible assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.609" offset="20409762">Indeed, as Judge Prettyman's concurring opinion in the court below points out, this is an interchange which has taken place very frequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.869" offset="20458872">I should also add that burglary is of course a local crime defined in the District of Columbia Code which may be tried under the District of Columbia Code in the Court known as the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.011" offset="20527417">It seems to me therefore that the case stands exactly as if Congress had specifically provided for the charge of robbery in the District of Columbia, should be tried in a court with this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.622" offset="20581857">A court which should have normal judicial powers who function in the matter common to most courts, which should have the jurisdiction of the Federal District Courts scattered through the country, which also should have jurisdiction over local crimes committed in the District and of suits between citizens of the District meeting certain requirements and which should further exercise certain legislative, executive, and administrative functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.215" offset="20696273">And over which there should preside either a judge known as the District Judge or a judge known as a Judge of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.769" offset="20746428">In other words, it stands exactly as if the Congress had said in so many words that a local charge of burglary in the District of Columbia may be tried before a court presided over by a judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.176" offset="20812048">And the petitioner cannot possibly prevail in this case, I submit, unless he can show either that Congress would have had no constitutional power to enact such a statute or else that its enactment with the provisions here violated some specific limitation, giving him constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.424" offset="20901073">Now, we find the authority to enact such a statute and therefore, this body of statute is having this effect in Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, giving the Congress power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such District as may become to seat of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.708" offset="20990203">And Congress has exercised that power creating courts in which the judges do not have life tenure, giving those courts duties which would not be regarded as proper to give to judges of an Article III court for -- well over a hundred -- indeed over 150 years.</text>
