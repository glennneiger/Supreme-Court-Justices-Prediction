            <label>Mr. David B. Rothstein</label>
            <text syncTime="13.982" offset="159326">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.690" offset="162147">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.533" offset="189524">This proceeding comes on to be heard upon the grant of a petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit limited to two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.525" offset="249501">The questions as we conceive of them are set forth in the petitioner's brief on page 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.415" offset="281057">Briefly, question number one is whether it is within the discretion of a trial judge to excuse production of documents of expenditures made by informer witnesses a foundation for such production having been laid in accordance with Title 18 Section 3500.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.923" offset="375097">And the Government having offered in lieu thereof a schedule of amounts received or paid to the witnesses and the dates of payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.070" offset="423685">Second question is whether jury instructions properly define membership and affiliation -- membership in an affiliation to the Communist Party because the two questions lend themselves, we think, very nicely to a division of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.659" offset="506023">I propose to discuss the first question, my associate, Mr. Pollitt, will discuss the second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.453" offset="557223">The proceeding, if the Court please, was initiated by the filing of a two-count indictment in November 1955 in the District Court seating in Chicago, Illinois alleging a false swearing in violation of Title 18 Section 1001 by the filing of a false non-communist affidavit in the Chicago Office of the National Labor Relations Board on December 11, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.502" offset="693373">Count I alleges that the defendant was in fact a member of the Communist Party and Count II alleges that the defendant was in fact affiliated to that party.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.083" offset="743737">As the Government suggests in its brief, Section 9 (h) pursuant to which the affidavit was filed has been repealed and a substitute bill enacted it, I think having a similar purpose for which the maximum penalty at least in terms of imprisonment he violated his one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.244" offset="844361">The defendant in this proceeding has been convicted twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.594" offset="861706">Each time he was sentenced to serve a term of five years upon the membership count and three years upon the affiliation count of the sentences to run concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.966" offset="911235">The first conviction was reversed by the Court of Appeals upon the petition of the defendant for rehearing, specifically upon the authority of Jencks versus the United States without further comment by the Court of Appeals, Jencks having comedown while the appeal was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.321" offset="988662">The second conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.564" offset="1009664">As we view the record, the case for the Government rested in a large part upon the testimony of witnesses, Sullivan and Ondrejka.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.199" offset="1048116">Each was employed by the Government to join the Communist Party for the purpose of reporting their activities and the activities of those with whom they would become associated therein to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.418" offset="1109034">For their service, each was paid with a monthly salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.567" offset="1129618">In addition, Sullivan received a monthly expense allowance and some reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.526" offset="1161488">He signed receipts for the moneys received by him for the expense allowance salary and reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.076" offset="1195656">Ondrejka reported his expenses to an agent orally, who at the time, he made the reports, made written memoranda of the saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.911" offset="1251035">By ruling of the trial court, the defendant at the trial was precluded from inquiring it to the contents of the receipts signed by Sullivan from ascertaining whether Ondrejka signed receipts when he was paid or the contents of the saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.963" offset="1327208">Because Ondrejka was the only Government witness who testified concerning defendant's alleged connection with the Communist Party from April 1951 through August 1953 including the affidavit period, his testimony, we believe, was crucial to the Government -- case for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.377" offset="1416861">At the trial, if the Court please, the defendant moved for production of witness statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.470" offset="1449253">In addition, defendants specifically moved for its production of statements of expenditures made by Ondrejka the Government agents orally and noted by these agents at the time and receipts if any, given by the witness in payment thereof.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.411" offset="1544965">With respect to Sullivan, the only motion made was the production of statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.720" offset="1578297">The Government failed to produce the receipts signed by Sullivan and with respect to Ondrejka, he'd offered only a schedule of payments made to Ondrejka showing only the dates of payment and the amounts received as we understood the Government offer there as we understand the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.948" offset="1667114">In the face of the Government opposition, the trial judge did not order a production of the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.266" offset="1700446">With respect to Ondrejka, the Government never produced the receipts signed by Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.474" offset="1733256">It was on this date of the record that we came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.386" offset="1752900">Now, for a number of years as again as we read the record and I think has conceded by the Government in its brief, government attorneys had read the trial court and the Court of Appeals to believe that all of the requested documents existed was specifically the documents requested with respect to Ondrejka existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.115" offset="1855822">There was no question about the fact that the receipts signed by Sullivan existed because they was -- they were in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.175" offset="1884035">And that the receipt signed by Ondrejka did not itemize the expenses reimbursed.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.406" offset="1912978">The problem of their production has been decided in two courts upon these assumptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.196" offset="2212133">I -- I am not suggesting nor do I intend to suggest that the Assistant District Attorney assigned to the case and the Assistant Attorney General assigned to the case did not make the statements that they made to the Court in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.546" offset="2281514">And I confine my statements to exactly those two gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.308" offset="2308577">The Government now concedes that the statement of expenditures written by the agents from Ondrejka's oral reports could be and that the receipts given by Sullivan and Ondrejka are statements within the meaning of Section 3500 of the Title 18, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.015" offset="2395408">In addition however, in its brief file within the past two weeks, the Government also states for the first time that the statements no longer exist, that is to say the memorandum made by the agents who made them contempt -- contemporaneously with the time they took the oral statements from the witness Ondrejka.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.897" offset="2490911">The Solicitor General tells us that he is told that the agents made handwritten personal notes of amounts reported to them by Ondrejka that the notes where destroyed immediately after the receipts were prepared in the normal of course of operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="756.888" offset="3130911">And our disagreement is predicated upon the following reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="776.262" offset="3208443">This suppression of evidence by destruction however, may not lightly be passed over by characterizing these notes as the Solicitor General does in his personal notes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.107" offset="4287822">For example, if the witness had deliberately overstated his expenses in his oral report to the agent, he might very well have been charged with making a false statement under the very same section for violation in which the defendant before the bar in this Court now stating his charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1166.022" offset="4767431">Assuming that I have stated this part of the Government argument correctly, there were at least several answers to this assertion in our judgement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.252" offset="5044328">But I think perhaps that's an exact statement of the fact, credibility is important.</text>

            <text syncTime="2382.553" offset="9633625">Because the trial court charged on page 40 of our brief briefly stated affiliation is charged in the second count of the indictment means a relationship which is equivalent or equal to that of membership in all but name.</text>

            <text syncTime="2969.058" offset="11979630">And here however, where this issue is involved, we have to rely on clear thinking because if it gets muddled, all the prejudices of the community come pouring in.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.952" offset="12103137">One is the indicia which the trial court gave the jury as to memberships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.416" offset="12141066">We maintain that these indicia which are taken from Section 5 of the Communist Control Act of 1954, that this indicia set forth in 38 -- page 38 and 39 our brief, open the door to guilt by association, the whole doctrine of parallelism, and a doctrine which I consider even more evil, the doctrine that because an act made in the opinion of the jurors have a tendency to advance communism.</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.916" offset="12527052">Then by those facts, the jury man is permitted to derive that the defendant is a communist.</text>
