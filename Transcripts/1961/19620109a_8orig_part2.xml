            <label>Mr. Mark Wilmer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">I am told that I may have misspoken this morning in stating the figures which Senator Johnson placed in the record as being the -- then uses of California until I said a million, two hundred and some thousands, two million a hundred and fifty-nine thousand, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.188" offset="212093">The amount which he claimed was six million and nine thousand, I think I stated that big, his claim but the uses which he specified were in the neighborhood of two million one or two hundred thousand rather than if I did say so, one million Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.497" offset="289311">Secondly before going on, I would like to make it clear that Arizona concurs in the Master's conclusion that inflow below Lee Ferry and in to the reservoir is part of the water which is the subject of the congressional consideration and distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.351" offset="392756">I may have spoken improvidently, a time of Upper Basin water, it is the Master's view and it is our view that Congress dealt with the supply of water at Lee Ferry mainstream which of course is Upper Basin water.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.663" offset="469974">And in addition, recognized there would be inflow below Lee Ferry and above Hoover or Boulder Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.477" offset="513233">Arizona does not contend for a moment that this water when and as it reaches the mainstream is not subject to the provisions of the Act, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.251" offset="560358">Make no contention to that effect at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.842" offset="578748">Your Honor, there is one as known as the Little Colorado, actually the most water which reaches the stream from that is and what is known as Blue Springs which are down at the bottom of a rather deep canyon and close to the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.969" offset="635277">On occasion, the Little Colorado runs in the spring and flood.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.139" offset="655966">It -- it drains an area of Northern Arizona much like the Upper Basin that is, it's a high country in snow and that sort of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.017" offset="695463">Yes, there are old consumptive uses Your Honor, going back to the '70s perhaps, it was the -- some of our -- for a moment, the early seven -- the northern part of the state in that area but not large and the inflow is sporadic and is not large, there is an addition from Utah and Nevada, the Virgin River, the Muddy River.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.404" offset="800998">There are miscellaneous springs and inflows but, actually as I remember the figures they gained from Lee Ferry to the dam generally is recognized as in the magnitude of a million acre-feet, maybe a little higher.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.907" offset="1090957">In other words, we believe that Section 8 again protects us, in that -- it says that water within the state except as it is modified by the Colorado River Compact is not to be disturbed by the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.738" offset="1162324">We say and we agree with the Master in his conclusion that when the Secretary said that you have to accept uses on your tributaries which might never reach or which -- I'm -- would be making an accurate statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.902" offset="1223032">The statement was that uses on the tributaries to the extent they diminished the flow into the reservoir are chargeable against our two million eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.654" offset="1262007">We disagree with this requirement that we accept uses to the extent they deplete the flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.568" offset="1293667">We do concur that to the extent that flow reaches the river and becomes a part of the stream, it then becomes subject to the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.154" offset="1332015">I cannot add it, if it please the Court to the Master's treatment of our objection.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.970" offset="2227284">First of, on page 8 of this little pamphlet that we have provided is an amendment printed but not offered by Senator Phipps.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.440" offset="2269184">This amendment later became the first paragraph of Section 4 (a), the first paragraph of the limitation on California and the requirement for seven States or six States ratification.</text>

            <text syncTime="578.323" offset="2416619">Section 4 (a) as printed by Senator Phipps in the first session did this very significant thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.461" offset="2461236">It eliminated it from Section 5, if you would turn back if you please, to Section 5, to the portion I emphasized on page 3 that is italicized.</text>

            <text syncTime="650.915" offset="2706996">Senator Phipps offered this amendment, which eliminated it from Section 5, this limitation on the Secretary but transferred it to Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.522" offset="2761435">The language of the Phipps amendment as introduced on page 8 provided for the ratification and provided and inserted for the first time the requirement that the limitation on -- use should be stricken from Section 5 and should be incorporated in Section 4, page 8 and 9, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.847" offset="2914722">In other words, it provides first for the alternate of the little book, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.512" offset="2941471">The top of page 9, it provides, "And until the State of California by Act of its legislature shall agree with the United States and for the benefit of the States of Arizona, Colorado and Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming as an expressed covenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.220" offset="3000299">And in consideration the passage of this Act, that the aggregate -- angled diversions of water coming from the Colorado River for use in the State of California, including all diversions under contracts made under the provision of this Act and so on, shall not exceed four million six hundred thousand acre-feet of the water apportioned to the Lower Basin States for the Colorado River Compact or one half of the surplus."</text>
            <text syncTime="746.078" offset="3087653">Now this point -- in this amendment Senator Phipps proposed the excision from Section 5 of the contractual limitation on the Secretary as imposing a limitation on California and inserted it in Section 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="760.233" offset="3144286">The last portion on page 7 strike out the land's four to 12 inclusive and insert a neuter on the following that you will find is an excision from Section 5 of the italicized portion which is found in the page 3, termination of that in the 69th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.221" offset="3244283">Senator Bratton offered an amendment along the same general lines and Senator Pittman offered an amendment which later became the Hayden amendment that is found on page 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.725" offset="3310320">The Pittman amendment envisage not only a transfer of the limitation to Section 4 (a) but a mandatory compact, and over to this point, we have in Section 4 (a) (1) a limitation by -- I mean a ratification by seven States, the ratification by six States, a limitation in California and a mandatory compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.583" offset="3409690">In other words, Congress in this language said California must agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.026" offset="3427453">If Arizona and Nevada accept the limitation which is proposed in paragraph 1, California then must compact along the lines of the division which we have previously indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.353" offset="3480743">In that connection, in discussing the matter, Senator Pittman made this observation that is why he said that he was at the Governors' Conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.774" offset="3534451">I wish to play -- this is from our legislative history at page 24, I wish to place in the record at this point a suggested amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.549" offset="3561618">It is not to be proposed because it will be perfectly useless but it had been suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.503" offset="3585337">It is in accordance for the conference to which I have just referred, Governors' Conference.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.209" offset="3624208">Now, Senator Pittman in substance said, this has been proposed to carry out what was arrived at at the Governors' Conference.</text>

            <text syncTime="893.831" offset="3678647">That's Mr. Francis Wilson, who was a well-known and respected attorney from New Mexico and a very highly regarded water attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.105" offset="3747819">It's not offered as an amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.802" offset="3758582">Now that, if it please the Court, about concludes the first section of the 70th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.994" offset="3779375">We find pending the Bratton amendment, the Phipps amendment, the Pittman amendment, all having the same central theme, a limitation in California, the Pittman amendment and mandatory compact in California and the removal of the limitation on the Secretary's power to contract from Section 5 as a limitation in California to Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.332" offset="3868714">Now, it is most significant -- most significant, that the excision of five at the same time was in connection or was at the same time a part of a connection with the amendment to four, which put the limitation in Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.278" offset="3932453">In other words, I can draw no conclusion reasonably I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.330" offset="3948648">But what the Phipps amendment said, "No we won't put this in Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.162" offset="3964008">We won't limit the Secretary's power to contract in this fashion, we'll make it part of Section 4 (a) and say that until California has by statute, limited herself, nothing so happen."</text>
            <text syncTime="980.768" offset="4026493">In other words, I think it is logical and reasonable inference that the 4 (a) limitation language being excised was transferred to and put into Section 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="993.177" offset="4076126">That becomes important in connection with our so-called mandatory allocation argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.192" offset="4100159">Now at the opening of the -- incidentally the first section is probably you all know entered in a filibuster which repeated the -- the passage of the Act to that session although the House had passed and sent to the Senate a companion measure introduced by Representative Swing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.821" offset="4446647">The bargaining was in process Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.329" offset="4452707">I think that's a fair analogy and a fair statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.534" offset="4465560">But it is significant, to please the Court, that at the opening of the second session of the 70th Congress, the Senator from California, Senator Johnson asked unanimous consent to take the House measure which had been passed, check up the title and insert underneath it the Senate measure, the Senate Bill 728.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.791" offset="4558555">In other words, at the outset of the 70th Congress, the Senate discarded the passed statute as sent forward from the House in the previous session and simply gave it the House number and did that by unanimous consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.068" offset="4627623">Now, in line with Justice Frankfurter's observation that the bargaining hadn't ended, I would conclude that the bargaining had made some satisfactory progress or this legislative maneuver would never have been achieved with unanimous consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.441" offset="4689168">I would have assumed that Senator Hayden and Senator Ashurst at least could have arose and said, "No, we won't agree to that."</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.889" offset="4718947">Now, the next amendment which is in order, is on page 11 which is the Hayden amendment to the -- to the then pending bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.469" offset="4793240">I would bring to Your Honors' attention this fact because of the fact that Senator Johnson asked and received unanimous consent to amend the House measure by eliminating the entire body of the Act and inserting in lieu thereof the body of the Act of 728, that then became an amendment, a pending amendment and that becomes important as we will see as we go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.891" offset="4894908">So that actually the matter pending before the House was the Johnson amendment to the House measure which had come forward and had been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.360" offset="4932838">The Hayden amendment was the Pittman amendment word per word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.944" offset="4951124">It proposed the mandatory compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.245" offset="4960319">It proposed the four million two to California, three million to Arizona and the same division in the mandatory compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.300" offset="5012564">Now, the thing that I now would stress, if it please the Court, is that the Phipps amendment had been printed in the first session.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.205" offset="5060211">The Phipps amendment as I may go back just briefly, one transferred from Section 5 to Section 4, the limitation on the right of California to get water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.663" offset="5110053">That became a part of Section 4 and it provided for a six-to-eight ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.163" offset="5136071">But the significant thing is that the Phipps amendment called for (Inaudible) -- for a excision of this limitation and its transfer to 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.095" offset="5179747">The next significant thing if I may say is this, Senator Phipps had offered -- had printed this amendment in the first session but had not offered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.433" offset="5213080">He did not offer it in the second session until Senator Hayden had offered his amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.672" offset="5242023">Now mind you, his amendment had been printed within the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.016" offset="5255398">Hayden's amendment had not been printed and was in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.120" offset="5267832">And yet Senator Phipps for some reason waited until the Hayden amendment had been tendered and offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.647" offset="5297925">And then he said this, offering his amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.398" offset="5312972">Mr. Phipps -- I'm reading from page 15 of our legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.160" offset="5331989">So I'm reading from page 15 of -- we printed this little excerpt on page 15 of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.315" offset="5356648">Mr. Phipps, I understand that the pending amendment is the one offered by the junior Senator from Arizona, Mr. Hayden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.832" offset="5386742">I desire to offer an amendment to that amendment which I believe is permissible under the rule enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.372" offset="5420910">In other words, not only did Senator Phipps wait until the Hayden amendment had been offered but before offering his amendment, he carefully inquired and was assured that it was a Hayden amendment to which his amendment was being offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.677" offset="5482036">Now, may I suggest the significance of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.609" offset="5497814">The Hayden amendment then contained the mandatory formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.541" offset="5513488">The Hayden amendment then provided that California must compact along the lines indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.579" offset="5549641">Now, if Senator Phipps have not been keenly aware of what Senator Hayden's amendment contained, that was two paragraphs and not one, he wouldn't have been so careful and he wouldn't have waited but he first found out it was a Hayden amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.689" offset="5606170">And in the Hayden amendment, there was a mandatory formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.410" offset="5624978">Senator Phipps in his amendment struck out the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.337" offset="5644727">I mean, in his amendment to Section 5, not only changed over the limitation on the Secretary but added the language, "and shall conform to the provisions of Section 4 (a) and shall conform to the provisions of Section 4 (a)."</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.190" offset="5720168">California has told you that when the Phipps amendment was offered, there was nothing for Congress, it was an isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.628" offset="5741902">That is not the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.560" offset="5749635">The legislative history clearly indicates that when Senator Phipps offered his amendment, he offered it by striking out the first paragraph of Section 4 (a) of the Hayden amendment and as a part of his amendment requiring that contracts shall conform to Section 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.967" offset="5819225">We say that is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.285" offset="5824554">We think it indicates that Senator Phipps that the bargaining have progressed if I may use your term Mr. Justice Frankfurter, had progressed and that it was all part of a more or less agreed course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.230" offset="5880247">Now, the -- the amendment then became the amendment in the second degree, the Phipps amendment, the Hayden amendment and the Johnson amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.521" offset="5925491">This was debated for some time and then this parliamentary maneuver ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.679" offset="5962062">The Senator from Wis -- from Arizona, Mr. Hayden asked in page 17 of our little excerpt here, "Mr. President, I would like to have the attention of the Senator", and if the Court will permit me, I would like to read this because I think it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.815" offset="6038653">I -- that I may discuss the parliamentary situation as it exists and what am I do if possible to remedy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.082" offset="6067702">In order that the amendment offered by the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Phipps maybe perfected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.961" offset="6091212">As I understand the situation, the amendment offered by the Senator from Colorado is an amendment in the second degree, an amendment to the amendment which I have offered and therefore not subject to amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.859" offset="6134784">The Senator's amendment contains three substantive propositions upon which there is a difference of opinion between the States of Arizona and California and we must vote upon all of them as one if this amendment is not subject to amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.461" offset="6197164">But if the Senator's amendment could be made subject to amendment, the Senate could vote upon the various propositions separately, for example, the Senators taken from another part of the bill, a provision that refers to Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.466" offset="6257246">A provision that the State of California shall have four million six hundred thousand acre-feet of water on the Colorado River, on the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.762" offset="6290369">Now there's no dispute about what the Colorado River was, it wasn't the tributaries and it wasn't the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.404" offset="6308968">Arizona agrees that the State of California shall have four million two hundred thousand acre-feet of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.126" offset="6331852">Now, I desire at the range so that the Senate may vote upon the question of whether it shall be one figure or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.256" offset="6360377">Now, if anyone can tell you gentlemen that that wasn't a square cut issue before the Senate that they were voted -- vote upon how much water California should have and how it should be divided?</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.323" offset="6412622">I wouldn't know how to, more strongly express it if I were in the Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.007" offset="13767450">Now, with respect to Senator Pittman's remark, that is in -- sorry, I did have our legislative history but I don't have it's -- the quote, it's in the 70th Congressional Record at 232 on December 7, 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.334" offset="13864730">It said, "What is the difficulty?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.481" offset="13869328">We have only minor questions involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.627" offset="13877896">There is practically nothing involved except the dispute between the States of Arizona and California in regard to the division of the increased water that will be impounded by in the proposed dam.</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.296" offset="13932544">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.145" offset="13943933">An agreement has been entered into between the seven states interested in the river, this river by which half of that water is retained in the four upper states and half of it let down to the three lower states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.589" offset="13985729">The four upper states have ratified the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.385" offset="13996910">The question now is for Arizona to ratify the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.421" offset="14013106">Arizona, as I understand, will ratify the agreement whenever there's -- whenever there shall be provided in the bill or a separate agreement between Nevada and Arizona and California, dividing the water let down to the three lower states of the 3,500,000 acre-feet of water let down that river, they have gotten together within 400,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.352" offset="14096802">They have got to get together and if they do not get together, Congress should bring them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.316" offset="14124596">Now, California quoted from Senator Phipps with respect to a statement he made, the effect that he didn't see why the Gila should not be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.477" offset="14169318">I would direct Your Honors' attention to our legislative histories, pages 76, 77, 78 and 79 which demonstrates that Senator Phipps was under a misunderstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.253" offset="14220413">He thought that there was a million acre-feet flowing into the mainstream from the Gila and he thought that Arizona was desirous of retaining control of that million acre-feet as well as the uses on its tributaries, that is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.248" offset="14284361">But it was explained to him that this million acre-feet talked about was merely returned flow if a large amount of Colorado River water were diverted, he was then satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.859" offset="14322813">All Senator Phipps was talking about when he said that tributaries should be included was his misunderstanding that Arizona was contending that Gila River water after it got in the mainstream should be likewise exempt for the benefit of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.436" offset="14389164">In view of the fact that our legislative history has, I think covered in detail, at least we have, I believe conscientiously tried to include the good with the bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.738" offset="14430333">I'm not going to take further of the Court's time in reading excerpts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.427" offset="14449037">I would like, however, to briefly dwell upon the administrative interpretation subsequent to the passage of the Boulder Canyon Project Act as to whether or not this was mainstream or other water and as to whether 4 (a) made an apportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.481" offset="14517269">The Court will recall that Secretary of Interior Wilbur at that time was in charge of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.975" offset="14543287">He was from California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.605" offset="14553840">He was certainly not interest -- disinterested party in the full sense of the word but he certainly attempted to be disinterested and we think he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.392" offset="14592920">The Wilbur-Healey documents contain these collection of the various Hoover Dam documents and also an explanation by the Secretary of the Interior Wilbur, as to what he had done implementing the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.541" offset="14649553">In Wilbur and Healey, the Hoover Dam Contract, the 1933 Edition at pages 41 and 42, which is an exhibit, this statement occurs, "The Department has promulgated regulations designed to assure water supply to Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.936" offset="14723114">These regulations are included as an appendix in this volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.826" offset="14738683">They outlined the form of the Hoover Dam water delivery contract which the United States will enter into with Arizona upon certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.931" offset="14767104">Briefly, the contract calls for the delivery of 2,800,000 acre-feet annually.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.026" offset="14787480">In return for which Arizona undertakes to make no interference with the diversion by other government contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.285" offset="14816528">This quantity of water is adequate for all of the Arizona projects below Hoover Dam and is without prejudice to the power of parties to contract from the future for a delivery of additional water as required."</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.880" offset="14858846">Then this significant language, "Arizona is thus offered an assurance of 2,800,000 acre-feet of mainstream water that given an opportunity to look to the United States rather than to an agreement with the other states for a delivery of that quantity of water in return for an agreement not to interfere with the diversions of resistive states."</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.932" offset="14943065">In other words, in 1933, the Secretary of the Interior, in making a regulation which proposed a contract of Arizona stated that he was allocating to Arizona 2,800,000 acre-feet of mainstream water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.197" offset="15012133">Now, subsequent to the enactment of the Project Act, there were a number of contracts entered into by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.157" offset="15044002">The California contracts were pursuant to what was turned a seven-party agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.266" offset="15068453">In other words, the Palo Verde Irrigation District, the Yuma Project of the California Division, that is the sister project across the stream from the Arizona project, the Imperial Irrigation District, Coachella Valley, Metropolitan Water District, City and County of San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.572" offset="15137625">Now, the significant thing on this seven-party agreement is this, it divided the proposed water delivery contracts up into several priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.791" offset="15182555">It delivered -- it divided them up into four priorities which were termed the Irrigation Priorities and the Metropolitan Water District Priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.306" offset="15224560">The significant thing is that as to the fourth and fifth priority, both of which were allocated to the Metropolitan Water District and/or the City of Los Angeles, they split them in two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.668" offset="15278059">The first was 550,000 acre-feet which will -- with the agricultural priorities, equal and even 4,400,000 -- equal and even 4,400,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.642" offset="15321945">In other words, at that time, California herself understood that the 4,400,000 was a first priority and in their own seven-party agreement so indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.798" offset="15370533">Now, the next thing that is significant is that in each of these contracts, including the Arizona contract, the Secretary contracts to deliver storage water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.811" offset="15418598">He does not contract to deliver water pursuant to any scheme of priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.161" offset="15443989">He simply contracts to deliver out of storage so many gross acres of water for use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.204" offset="15472201">In fact, the Palo Verde contract contained this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.084" offset="15491741">This was cited by California as a typical contract and most of them are quite similar although I'm not sure this particular clause appears in all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.569" offset="15529671">Section 4, "Whereas, the district is desirous", and this is appendix to the Master's brief number -- number 8, (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.704" offset="15606157">"Whereas the district is desirous of entering into a contract with the delivery to it of water from Boulder Canyon Reservoir and it is to the mutual interest of the parties hereto that such contract be executed and the rights of the district in and to the waters of the rivers be hereby defined."</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.563" offset="15677628">In other words, the contract itself provides that it defines the rights of the district in and to the river, the waters of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.962" offset="15719215">And that contract, may it please the Court, is strictly a storage contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.171" offset="15736038">It speaks not one word of the fact that the delivery is to -- pursuant to appropriative rights, pursuant to anything, it's a straight storage contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.339" offset="15792776">I think I'm perhaps pursuing this rather unnecessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.171" offset="15812106">The Master himself has reached to his conclusion that the interaction of the Section 4 (a) and 5 plus the Secretary's contracts have resulted in an allocation of the entire stream flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.529" offset="15881488">At page 224 and 225 of his report, he said this, "Since the Secretary hasn't intentionally bound himself with contractual apportionment substantially, although not precisely, along the lines suggested by Congress as fair and equitable in the two paragraphs of Section 4 (a) of the Project Act, that section has been used as a guide for interpreting and defining the contractual allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.209" offset="15980231">Applying these laws to the contracts, I interpret them as establishing the following water delivery scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.844" offset="16006771">The Secretary in his discretion decides how much water is to be released from mainstream reservoirs at any particular period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.179" offset="16040103">The amount available for consumption in the United States in any one year shall be the amount so released less the amount necessary to satisfy higher priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.979" offset="16075316">The contracts do not limit the Secretary's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.267" offset="16088482">They operate only upon the mainstream water which is available for consumption in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.132" offset="16107917">They refer that this water be apportioned as follows, of the first 7,000,005 acre-feet of consumptive use in any one year, 4.4 million for use in California, 2.8 million in Arizona and 0.3 in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.059" offset="16167581">Of the remaining consumptive use during the -- the year, 50% were used in California and 50% in Arizona, subject to the possibility that Arizona's share maybe reduced 46% of the Secretary's contract, to keep the Secretary contracts to allocate 4% of the surplus to Arizona."</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.349" offset="16252740">Now, I'd like to drop by just a minute Mr. Justice Black, if I might and say this because I didn't think I answered your question accurately or fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.610" offset="16285863">Under the Master's allocation, there is no draft on the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.228" offset="16308328">Under the Master's allocation there is no fixed allocation of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.077" offset="16327659">There is no finding required or attempted that every year there shall be 7,500,000, nothing of that character.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.838" offset="16358693">He says that of the water available for use, for consumptive use, in the Lower Basin, be it 7,500,000, be it seven, be it six, be it four, be it nine, of the first 7,500,000, this is how it goes, 2,800,000 to Arizona, 300,000 Nevada, 4,400,000 to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.064" offset="16435597">So that (Inaudible) -- I think I didn't make it clear to you that the Master's allocation does not impose any burden upon the Upper Basin does not in any fashion affect the Upper Basin, it merely says that that water which is here physically for use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.517" offset="16505396">This is how I want it divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.671" offset="16510098">This is how I said the Project Act divides it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.600" offset="16521801">I think that that probably answers Your Honors' question with respect to whether or not this enlarges the obligation and provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.682" offset="16546147">It can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.109" offset="16547819">It doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.081" offset="16551685">It simply divides that which is there for division, no more and no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.264" offset="16576449">Further in that respect, I would like to say this, I may have misread some of these cases, but if I do not misread them, if I do not misread the Chandler-Dunbar case, I do not know how it lies within the jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.384" offset="16636949">When Congress has taken in its mighty hands, under the Commerce Power Clause, which the constitution gives it, this water has taken it in its hands so to speak and has said this is how it shall go.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.743" offset="16706330">This is how we shall handle it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.133" offset="16715943">I tell the Secretary first, you shall operate this reservoir and this dam to control floods, to regulate the flow of the river and in aid of navigation, secondly and thirdly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.611" offset="16773831">But fundamentally, you are charged with the obligation of operating this river in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.407" offset="16797027">Now, in what fashion may I inquire, should this Court then put its hands on the river and tell the Secretary how he is to operate the river unless -- excuse me, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="4343.659" offset="17477987">Well, granted Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.420" offset="17489063">One other thing if I might in passing from the Project Act then to the remaining somewhat we regard less vital questions in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.516" offset="17533471">I would ask Your Honors to take a look at the language of Section 4 (a) again and Section 8 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.719" offset="17566281">8 (b) is the provision which is found in -- is in the Project Act, the appendix of the Master's report number 3 -- page 380, 389.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.052" offset="17655620">The language of the Project Act which I would refer to is the last portion of Section 4 (a) and draw this thing -- this to Your Honors' attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.808" offset="17718627">Section 8 (a) provides in -- 8 (b) provides in substance that the United States in administering the river, in the contracting for use of power or water for irrigation shall observe and be subject to and control anything to the contrary here and not withstanding by the terms of such compact, if any, between the States of Arizona, California and Nevada or any two thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.737" offset="17834297">Or the equitable division of the benefits including power arising from the use of water going to said states, subsidiary to and consistent with said Colorado River Compact which maybe negotiated and approved by said states under which Congress shall give its consent and approval on or before January 21, 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.190" offset="17916113">The terms of any such compact included between said states and approved and consented to by Congress after said date provided that in the latter case, such compact shall be subject to all contracts, if any, made by the Secretary of the Interior under Section 5 hereof, prior to the date of such approval and consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.595" offset="17993749">Now, in substance, this says -- thank you -- this says, that with respect to any compact entered into by any of the three states or any two of them, any two of them and I want to come to that in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.290" offset="18064488">That the Secretary shall be bound by them provided, that as to any contracts made after January 1, any compacts made after January 1, 1929, that they shall be subject to contracts made by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.541" offset="18145573">The legislative history of that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.628" offset="18157902">This was proposed by Mr. Esquire, a Nevada witness fairly early in the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.829" offset="18182666">And he explained and he thought it was proper the state should be permitted the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.423" offset="18201057">Mr. Delph Carpenter and that is also available, in testifying, stated that the reason for this date was to stay the hand of the Secretary until the state should have a chance to compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.739" offset="18254346">In other words, as to any compacts entered into prior to January 1, 1929, the Government was to be bound by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.800" offset="18294575">As to any compact after that date, then the Government was bound by them but such compact was subject to the Secretary's contracts made prior thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.266" offset="18336475">Now I ask you first of all, on what basis could this -- could two states compact with respect to a body of water available to three if it hadn't already been divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.445" offset="18385168">Now, this amendment which changed it from three states to two states or more was contemporaneous with a part of the general format that resulted in 5 (a) of the legislative history I've just given you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.385" offset="18448906">Up to that point, this provision in the statute had been three states only.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.177" offset="18468028">But after this concept of the -- shall conform to the language of Section 5 shall conform to Section 4 (a) after that language came into the picture and was a part of it, then, the Congress changed this to any two or more of the three states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.625" offset="18537827">I respectfully say to you first that you can't have two states dividing up water belonging to three unless the Congress has already divided it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4616.793" stopTime="4622.079">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="4616.793" offset="18570533">Well, but Congress -- if the Congress had already divided it, what would be the point of having any compact at all?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_wilmer" startTime="4622.079" stopTime="5232.748">
            <label>Mr. Mark Wilmer</label>
            <text syncTime="4622.079" offset="18591640">Except they could change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.399" offset="18596968">They could change it, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.028" offset="18603447">In other words, the Compact in 4 (a) was pre-approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.053" offset="18639600">That was something which they only had to approve and didn't have to come back to Congress but Congress said in addition, "Now, if you want to make a different division, the authority resides in Section 8 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.309" offset="18676590">You can divide this water up and still come back to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.456" offset="18689233">But California maybe only gets only 4,300,000, maybe Nevada and Arizona wants to fool around a little bit with you."</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.869" offset="18714833">But the significance of this is that in Section 4 (a), it was a pre-approved compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.815" offset="18738657">It was a compact which did not need to come back to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.075" offset="18751718">In Section 8 (b), a compact was authorized between two or more states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.126" offset="18771884">But that had to come back to Congress for approval as if the Secretary had made any contracts because they didn't compact before January 1, then his contract took precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.764" offset="18814412">I say the first point is this, there had to be an understanding in Congress that the water had already been allocated otherwise, could Nevada and Arizona take some water away from California?</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.887" offset="18866970">Congress certainly didn't consider that but the more important point, I want to suggest to the Court is this, in Section 4 (a) Compact -- in the Section 4 (a) Compact approved in advance by Congress, there wasn't any such provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.018" offset="18931440">There wasn't any provision in the 4 (a) Compact that the Secretary's contracts took precedence or didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.047" offset="18963519">There was just as much likelihood that the 4 (a) Compact pre-approved by Congress wouldn't be made for a year or two years, just as much as with respect to 8 (b), just as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.236" offset="19020361">Yet in 8 (b), which was not the allocation made by Congress in 4 (a), Congress said that the Secretary contracts before you do this, his contracts take precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.602" offset="19069785">But we say that decisively -- decisively, the 4 (a) is a mandatory allocation that Congress did regard it as a mandatory allocation because otherwise, they would have made some provision for the Secretary's contracts which preceded the approval of the pre-approved 4 (a) Compact, otherwise you would have an impossible clash.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.450" offset="19161213">You'd have a situation of Arizona, Nevada and California not compacting for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.109" offset="19187858">There's nothing in the language that said the Secretary's hand was to be tied in connection with this particular thing, this particular provision in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.938" offset="19219101">So we say that we do believe our argument that it is a mandatory -- a formula is very persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.998" offset="19251388">We say otherwise there would have been language in the 4 (a) that would have made some provision for the Secretary's contract deviating from the allocation made therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="4797.729" offset="19294333">Otherwise, you would have contracts for permanent service, clashing with a compact which the Congress had already approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.726" offset="19326307">We did not make that argument before the Special Master, frankly, hadn't occurred to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.516" offset="19345429">But that Mr. Justice Frankfurter once said that the wisdom sometimes never comes and therefore when it comes late, you shouldn't ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.425" offset="19373119">Well, we had several attacks of character unfortunately in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.045" offset="19403525">Now, I would like to briefly, if I might, advert for just a moment to the Master's finding with respect to present perfected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.139" offset="19459950">I have stated -- we have stated that we don't regard it as a magnitude in this case but we do regard it as having consequences for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.178" offset="19500074">The Master has suggested that subsequent to this termination of this case, that all parties shall file their appropriative rights with the Secretary, I believe it is and then if we don't agree then there's going to be another great big lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.152" offset="19552005">Well, if we have a lawsuit, we'll have lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.818" offset="19562663">We believe, however, that the present perfected rights provision of Section 6 relates only to a satisfaction of the requirements of Article VIII of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.722" offset="19610311">And that has gone back in the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.018" offset="19619401">We believe that Congress simply said, if they had intended to preserve all present perfected rights, they would have said so, they don't need to say in pursuance of Article VIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.039" offset="19659525">They would have said, all present perfected rights shall be respected but they did not say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.448" offset="19681155">They said in pursuance of Article VIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.799" offset="19690559">They had previously rejected the notion that present -- that appropriative rights shall be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.300" offset="19712606">And they therefore, we believe we're simply providing that with respect to the provision of Article VIII of the Compact, this discharged that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.943" offset="19751163">Now on that connection, the Master held and I'm not going into a compact argument, but Section 6 of the Compact, contains this language, "That if there is a dispute between two or more signatory states, between two or more signatory states of the Compact with respect to waters of the Colorado River System not covered by the Compact, then the following shall occur."</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.070" offset="19867669">Now, you have a flat out finding there, a flat out contract -- Compact provision but there are waters not covered by the Compact because that's what it says as to -- with respect to waters in the Colorado River System not covered by the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.189" offset="19932139">We took the position that that did again indicate that Lower Basin tributaries were not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.309" offset="19952619">The Master in a sense agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.686" offset="19962128">He said that that demonstrates that there is only inter-basin results -- inter-basin effects of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.706" offset="20002147">It is not an intra based and interstate matter and that therefore, that language refers to in intra-basin interstate rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.846" offset="20038719">So we say again if that is true, if that language of Article 6 says that the Lower Basin tributaries interstate of the Lower Basin are not involved, then again, the present perfected rights means only against the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.991" offset="20107368">The -- the interpretation you have suggested is that of -- of the -- of -- Representative Swing that has -- wipes out appropriative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.277" offset="20156479">Senator Johnson made a very interesting remark in which he said, "Oh, one of these days you're going to regret it if you maintain these theories of appropriative rights in the stream."</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.574" offset="20201618">That is quoted in our legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.062" offset="20215620">In summary, with respect to this phase of our case, we would simply say again, that there is no doubt, one, the Colorado River is a navigable stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.852" offset="20258774">That is judicially established as well as factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.948" offset="20271208">Secondly, there is no doubt that Congress took in control of the entire stream and stored the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.321" offset="20300675">There is no doubt that Congress gave directions to the Secretary as to what he was to do with that water and how was he to handle it and the purposes for which he was to put it -- for which he was to put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.524" offset="20337455">And that therefore, the law is clear that this is a matter of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.698" offset="20362115">It's a matter of interpreting the Project Act to determine what Congress intended in what language Congress spoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.617" offset="20393880">What meaning is to be inscribed to their words?</text>
            <text syncTime="5075.758" offset="20406418">Now, the balance of the time and I will quit at the end of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.946" offset="20447169">I want to comment briefly upon California's talked about water supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.186" offset="20472142">The problem we face is one which is not unusual in this type of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.411" offset="20505057">Originally before the Congress when she was opposing the Central Arizona Project, passed the Senate twice and was defeated in the House every time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.706" offset="20546226">Her position was that water was not legally available dependent upon an interpretation of the Compact and related legal documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.476" offset="20577259">In fact, my good friend Mr. Ely in numerous times said it was a question of law, nothing to do with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.104" offset="20603800">Now that that question has been resolved, becomes a question of fact as to whether or not water supply is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.749" offset="20634415">We believe that with the Master that whether or not, there 7,600,000, 7,800,000 or seven million ten, it is of no consequence so far as the determination of this case is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5144.927" offset="20683107">The Master said only this, that he was -- no, let me just stop for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.142" offset="20707976">The very argument that California has made today was made just as loudly, just as strongly before the Special Master in New York, August 17th, 18th and 19th I believe, before this report was filed on December 5th.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.243" offset="20772342">The draft report of the Master had been circulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.350" offset="20784776">Three days of argument was had in which these very arguments were made that are now being made to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.496" offset="20809331">The Master said, "If I believed, if I had any reason to believe that any of these dire consequences which you predict would ensue, I would very carefully reexamine the situation, I would strain for an interpretation which would avoid them."</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.945" offset="20883101">And he took the matter under advisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.157" offset="20891982">And in December 5th, he then filed this present report with respect first to the suggestion that the case be reopened, for the purpose of taking testimony in the Upper Basin as to the depletion there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.515" offset="20977455">I don't know quite how the Master could go on a so to speak frolic and detour of his own in the Upper Basin to gauge their future depletions without the Upper Basin being present.</text>

            <text syncTime="5393.280" offset="21676492">So California was unnoticed there.</text>

            <text syncTime="5435.417" offset="21845034">And then before the end of the California case we filed and proffered amended pleadings which the Master rejected and as he said in his brief it'd be strange in the case of this magnitude that parties were held to their pleadings, I find it unnecessary to rule upon it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6782.193" offset="27232110">We asked for no findings on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6785.181" offset="27244126">But California made such a commotion about a shortage that he made a finding in his report filed with this Court that undoubtedly, there was substantial wastage in the Imperial Valley and that water could be far more economically used.</text>

            <text syncTime="6817.140" offset="27371917">Because we say, that if there is waste -- if there is waste, if California is throwing away water, then while it's none of our business in so far as our present usage are concerned, it is our business if she's claiming a water right on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6839.163" offset="27460002">This if it please the Court, this plaintiff's Exhibit Number 237 in evidence admitted on the 7th -- 5th of July 1957.</text>

            <text syncTime="6859.557" offset="27541608">This is the discharge from the Imperial Valley.</text>
