            <label>Mr. Attorney General</label>
            <text syncTime="87.560" offset="453569">It was -- of importance because at that time, Arizona was ascertain alleged interpleading that the question of what Arizona was charged with under the Compact and under the 3,100,000 acre-feet that the other States could claim against this under the limitation was effective by the magnitude of the uses on the Gila River.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.583" offset="545729">We agree with that, so she is, but Arizona at that time contented that are uses on the Gila should not be measured by the quantity diverted unless a quantity return to the stream but should instead be measured by the much lesser amount by which those uses depleted the flow of the Colorado River to Mexican boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.380" offset="624933">Now, a difference -- not to dwell on it, the difference is that in that state of nature, part of the water that Arizona diverts in Phoenix area but never reach Mexico because it would have been burned out by evaporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.843" offset="670699">The Master decides that under the Compact and under the Project Act both consumptive use means the quantity use measured at the site of use which we contend diversions less returns to the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.986" offset="727333">Now, the figure of 2,000,00 acre-feet that I've used repeatedly with respect to the quantities of the uses on the tributaries, I do not represent to you, it was given the finding by the Master's is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.090" offset="775711">It is a figure which is the quantity developed by from two sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.081" offset="799744">One, the Arizona pleadings, the other is the California proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.176" offset="816044">Arizona alleged that measured by depletion, the uses on the Gila were about 1,000,000 acre-feet measured by diversions less return.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.487" offset="849272">There were approximately 1,0000,000 more than that or about 2,000,000 or a proof developed that the safe annual deal, the dependable supply of a Gila River fully use now in Arizona is of Nevada -- New Mexico is of the order of 1,750,000 acre-feet, and the uses on the other tributary are about 200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.475" offset="933282">Those are our figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.892" offset="938924">They're not the Master's but they are supported by the Arizona pleadings.</text>

            <label>Mr. Attorney General</label>
            <text syncTime="219.704" offset="982183">Yes, Your Honor if -- if the Project Act the limitation uses the expression Article 3 -- paragraph (a) of Article 3 compact as truly meaning what the compact means as a Master founds, the mainstream plus tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.703" offset="1058147">Then the uses on the tributary is our accountable against this 7,500,000 3 (a) water which the Lower Basin may claim and we can claim only 5,500,000 out of the -- out of the Red River, the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.670" offset="1114049">If they figure was not 2,000,000, but 1,000,000 or 1,500,000, it would by just that quantity effect the residue of 3a water that we could claim out of the main river.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.129" offset="1159920">Also another point that I should have made clear I -- I try to but it is the distinction between consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.179" offset="1200044">The figure I just that -- phrase I just used, and the flow of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.968" offset="1223241">Now, the Master did that in the quotation that I read to you supply, Article III (d) cannot be correlative with III (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="287.049" offset="1251558">The flow of the stream at a given point that has -- is not -- has nothing to do with the quantity of beneficial consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.132" offset="1291891">It's a little bit the different stream gross income and net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.289" offset="1320521">7,500,000 acre-feet flowing at Lee Ferry that flow the resource will not sustain 7,500,000 acre-feet of consumptive use diversions less returns at any point down stream because our losses between Lee Ferry and point of diversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.784" offset="1382484">And moreover, the quantity that returns to the stream after it's diverted is credit against that diversion, and arriving that the net consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.639" offset="1421876">As a matter of fact the water that inevitably reaches Mexico and the form of return flow from the American projects, nothing you could do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.196" offset="1456149">That's a great part of the source from Mexico is deducted from a total diverted in the United States to arrive at the beneficial consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.215" offset="1504214">Another point that has been mentioned here about Upper Basin depletions, Upper Basin expansion, I should be -- to make it very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.749" offset="1538382">The Master declined to let us entered this evidence on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.017" offset="1559489">When the -- we first discovered from his report that he regarded the rate of Upper Basin depletions as a material, as relevant that there was no possibility of shortage under his formula because there is nothing to show how rapidly the Upper Basin were developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.284" offset="1624482">We ask Lee to present evidence upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.469" offset="1637230">The only evidence we had offered or referred during the trial he'd excluded and he declined to permit the trial of reopen to take testimony upon that.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.296" offset="1688534">Well, the relevance we saw in it was simply to answer his assertion of impossibility of shortage that his formula should not be measured by its effect because the effect we saw was based upon the enforcement of the compact and there's no likelihood the compact ever be enforced, nothing to show the Upper Basin every use so much water.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.121" offset="1771813">In other words, if the point he made against this is relevant that there's no possibility of shortage because the compact never be enforced, we thought it relevant, have an opportunity to rebut that by in the form of the chart that I showed you a few minutes ago that the Upper Basin can expand at all --</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.067" offset="4219591">By contrast, Arizona which was use in, perhaps, 250,000 before Hoover Dam was built would get out of the same 6,500,000 acre-feet about 2,400,000 or about 2,000,000 acre-feet of the benefits storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.170" offset="4280090">The benefits of storage are allocated between the States in such fashion that virtually all of the incremental new water made available by the construction of Hoover Dam goes to Arizona and Nevada and in minimum of it to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.152" offset="4348008">But the effect of the Master's formula, is that if -- in event of shortage, if there isn't 7,500,000 acre-feet for these three States, California bears 44/75ths or 59% of that shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.384" offset="4408926">Out of 6,500,000 acre-feet that the river may make available to the Lower Basin, we're in fact to allocate it about 20% of the new storage water, 20%, and Arizona, Nevada about 80%.But if there is shortage, we bear 59% of that shortage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2916.321" offset="11768665">That is why Arizona rejected the Colorado River Compact because the tributaries are so plainly included within its scope.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.402" offset="11896978">And for that very reason, no part of this compact for 22 years, it's because the tributaries were included.</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.282" offset="13352521">The narrow question is that the California Legislature in passing these two statutes on the same day used in one of them the expression Article III of the Colorado River Compact as encompassing the tributaries in which event we were assuming as against the Upper Basin the inclusion of the tributaries and the accounting which respect to the Mexican burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.356" offset="13440815">And on the same day, passed the statute that said with respect to Arizona exclude those tributaries, Article III (a) is inappropriate reference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3582.313" offset="14432632">The Master believes that the underscored language on the second page starting with the item one has this effect that the California Legislature, when it passed the statute accepting this offer and that Congress is making the offer, intended that the word “compact” which appears three times in the last half dozen lines, 4,400,000 acre-feet of the waters apportioned to the Lower Basin States by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.805" offset="14566588">That time, the word “compact” doesn't mean compact at all at shorthand, shorthand for 7,500,000 acre-feet in the Red River, Lake Mead to the Mexican body.</text>

            <text syncTime="4081.889" offset="16430895">The -- it is quite true -- it is quite true that in the debates on the Boulder Canyon Project Act, you'll find considerable confusion but the confusion is this.</text>

            <text syncTime="4130.305" offset="16624619">Senator Phipps of Colorado after this debate had indicated, developing confusion as to what they meant by this limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4179.754" offset="16822418">The language instead of saying paragraph (a) of Article III said simply the waters apportion to the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.546" offset="16861602">Senator Phipps said this, “Referring to the Amendment which is now before the Senate in order to remove any possible misunderstanding regarding the 4,400,000 acre-feet of water, I had desired to perfect the amendment by inserting on page 3 line 4 after the word by, the words paragraph (a) of Article III of so that it will show that that allocation of water refers directly to the 7,500,000 acre-feet of water that are mentioned in paragraph 3.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4948.706" offset="19898180">Namely, that if Arizona diverts in the flung third of the main river from the Lee Ferry to Lake Mead, what she takes there shall not be charge against the 2,800,000 acre-feet under this hypothetical compact where she takes it below Lake Mead and (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="4994.405" offset="20081037">Clause 7, said, agreement to take effect upon the ratification the Colorado River Compact by Arizona, California and Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.509" offset="20117400">Now, the Master says, the Master says in page 173 that I read at the beginning this morning that the Project Act in Section 4 (a) use a reference to paragraph (a) of Article III as shorthand, that his expression shorthand for 7,500,000 acre-feet in the main river, the Red River from Lake Mead to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.405" offset="20213008">Now, these three Legislatures were authorized by the second paragraph to enter into a compact provided it was exactly as written in Heichberger here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.233" offset="20264312">Is it sensible to say that not only it was Congress talking in shorthand in the first paragraph to the Legislature of California and California responded in shorthand?</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.046" offset="20307571">But moreover, if these three States of Legislatures adopted the compact to the second paragraph, they're supposed to be talking in shorthand in each other too by using a cryptogram.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.747" offset="20346337">When they say at paragraph (a) of Article III of the Compact, which by definition includes tributaries, all four sovereigns concerned, Congress, the three State Legislatures, all are presumed to be using that shorthand for something quite different.</text>

            <text syncTime="5185.947" offset="20847156">Here, the Master discussing the origin of the figures that were being quoted on the limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.070" offset="20879653">The conference about provision of the Governors in 1927 had proposed a formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.809" offset="20898565">It was related to the division of the 3d water, the water of the Upper Basin let down at Lee Ferry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5207.371" offset="20932838">The Master says after quoting the report from a remark from Senator Pittman, it was quoted from Governor's recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.214" offset="20972231">He says, “This report by Senator Pittman did not adopt or perhaps fail the grass that portion of the Governor's resolution which expressly found the source of the allocated waters in the Article III (d) obligation of the upper division, instead Senator Pittman related the limitation Article III (a), not III (d),” and he quotes Senator Pittman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.875" offset="21070869">On page 190 near the top he said, “Thus Senator Pittman used Article III (a) to define this -- the area against which the limitation was to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.449" offset="21105142">He did this in apparent misunderstanding of the Governor's recommendation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.682" offset="21126144">All subsequent discussion in the Senate flowed in the same channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.892" offset="21142967">Here, we're dealing with the debate that the Master characterized were confused and he doesn't -- he does not adopt the interpretation that Pittman is giving namely that the III (a) equals III (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.022" offset="21543476">He rejects that completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.947" offset="21543372">Having rejected it, there is not a single word in the legislative history, the Project Act to support the Master's truncation of the Colorado River at Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.642" offset="21543267">True enough, you'll find Senators who thought III (a) was the same thing as III (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.858" offset="21543163">True enough, you'll find Senator Phipps rejecting and correcting that, III (a) means the tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.841" offset="21543058">You will not find one Senator, you'll not find one word of support for the notion that the Senate of the United States intended to divide this river at Lake Mead, either Lee Ferry or include the tributaries but nobody said the Red River.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.533" offset="21542954">Now, the other element of the statutory compact that I want to emphasize is a priority feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5322.701" offset="21542849">The Master's concept is at Section 5 of the Project Act, which is in the reprint before you, delegated to the Secretary of the Interior, the authority to “impose a federal apportionment,” on the States if they fail to enter into a compact, and that the Secretary by its water deliver contracts in later use did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.177" offset="21542745">The Master rejects Arizona's contention that Section 4 (a) which we've just left creates a mandatory formula, a mandatory formula that the Secretary's bounded putting into effect but the States didn't accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.610" offset="21549850">He -- in doing so, he relies upon the colloquy I've quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.684" offset="21566151">He says, “I have rejected the contention of the second paragraph, in Section 4 (a) page on 202.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.624" offset="21589870">The Act established a mandatory form and they're governing them out of water, Arizona must receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.400" offset="21608991">He says at Section 5, “Authorize the Secretary of the Interior by in his discretion, in his discretion to place a formula in effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5384.955" offset="21643160">And that by the contract as Secretary later made, he did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.544" offset="21657579">And at that the conflict of the contracts of the Secretary were -- what I've described this morning namely proration, 44/75ths, 28/75ths, 375ths or whatever what was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.848" offset="21710764">Now, there is nothing in Section 5 which makes any such delegation of the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.425" offset="21741066">The record is replete with statements by Senators that the Congress did not have the power to divide the water, they -- as replete with the assurances that we're not delegating to the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.168" offset="21808044">Delegating to the Secretary of the Interior, the powers that they refused to exercise themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5439.807" offset="21862588">Here, typical expression, Senator Bratton of New Mexico, they're only two ways known to me through which titled the water of an interstate stream either for purposes of irrigation or development of power may be adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.512" offset="21905429">One is by a contract or agreement, the method sought to be followed in this case, and the others by a decree rendered in a suit instituted originally in the Supreme Court of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.203" offset="21940224">Here's Senator King, in the colloquy of Hayden, “If the Senator means by his statement,” as the King speaking, “That the Federal Government may go into a stream, whether it be the Colorado River, the Sacramento River or a river in the State of Montana and put its powerful hands down upon the stream and say, “This is mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.315" offset="22012635">I can build a dam there and allocate water to whom I please, regardless of other rights either suspended, inquorate or perfected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.955" offset="22039176">Now, I deny the position which the Senator takes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.049" offset="22055581">And Senator Hayden said, “The amendment that I have offered contemplates no such possibility.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.561" offset="22073657">That's the second paragraph of Section 4 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="5582.924" offset="22435088">And it is designed to require that no land may use waters of the Colorado River except by a contract which in turn shall contain the provisions required by 13 (b), (c) and (d) that it is subject to and in control by the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.905" offset="22499035">That is no use in Arizona could escape the consequences of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5602.920" offset="22515022">He had to get water by a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.829" offset="22522650">The contract had to contain a compact -- a compact term.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.526" offset="22537488">Here's -- here is Carpenter's explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.275" offset="22564446">Except by a contract made as herein stated means this, ”If the flow of the Colorado River is controlled and regulated by the constructions of Black Canyon Dam and any person of the State of Arizona attempt to take any water out of the stream, which has been discharged from the reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.587" offset="22617736">It's been carried in the streambed as actual conduit but (Inaudible), this law would be brought into effect and he would prevented from using any of that water independent with Colorado River Compact but unencumbered by any other condition for the benefit of California and Nevada.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.968" offset="22679280">In other words, a Compact does not disturb the right -- does not disturb the rights between Arizona, California and Nevada intercedes to their fortune of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5653.239" offset="22716374">The thought of this amendment is that any water stored in this reservoir, under the terms of the Compact when released through storage shall be burdened by the Compact wherever it goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.994" offset="22751378">As far as water is concerned, existing claims of the lower States are protected by the Compact and water must pass through this reservoir to take care of the person existing to lower claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="7018.226" offset="28176280">The limitation issue that I have spent so much time on and the priority issue which I do want to leave very firmly in your minds because we feel that even if you should decide that the Master's right on the limitation issue that reference to the Compact and the Limitation Act is inappropriate somehow.</text>
            <text syncTime="7037.934" offset="28255065">Nevertheless, we are entitled to protection for the priorities of our existing projects in California within that 4,400,000 acre-feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="7102.941" offset="28515140">Now, the Arizona, the first of these cases, I have already mentioned to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="7108.890" offset="28538964">If the Special Master is right in his interpretation of the Project Act, then it passes all comprehension that the Arizona Senators and Congressmen should've voted against this Act, should've opposed the appropriations to build Hoover Dam that conferred these benefits upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7124.316" offset="28600613">And in 1930, the State of Arizona sued in this Court to enjoin the Project Act in the Compact in going to effect.</text>
