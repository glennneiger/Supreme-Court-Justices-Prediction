            <text syncTime="945.589" offset="3885746">With reference to which Mr. Justice Sutherland stated that that was to be construed that where the United States was a party plaintiff and not a party defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1006.219" offset="4128266">One of the first reason that it is urged for the overruling of the Williams case is this, it is said that the -- this Court in the Williams case, disregarded the earlier rulings of this Court with respect to the Court of Claims, if not the rulings at least the views expressed by this Court with respect to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.041" offset="4243519">Now, the fact is that in the cases earlier like Bakelite or Williams, there was no discussion, there was no consideration of the question as to whether or not the Court of Claims was an Article I or an Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.018" offset="4323453">There were statements made by members of the court to the effect that the Court of Claims was a constitutional or Article III court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.682" offset="4442049">It was not until 1929 when this Court considered the Bakelite case where the very full discussion was given with respect to the United States Court of Customs and Appeal or Custom Appeals was engaged in and also a very thorough discussion with respect to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.108" offset="4539852">What was said of course with respect to the Court of Claims was very enlightening and very inspective but was not before the court in the Bakelite case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.724" offset="4630235">And in 1933, of course, there was a specific consideration of the question as to whether or not the Court of Claims was an Article I or an Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.107" offset="4679764">For in that case -- for in that case that this court had for determination whether or not legislation which had been passed providing for the reduction in the pay and the remuneration and compensation of judges of the Court of Claims could be effectively made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.063" offset="4759594">It was urged on behalf of Judge Williams who was the plaintiff in that case in the Court of Claims which was moved to this Court immediately, that he was a constitutional or Article III court judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.171" offset="6044087">I am not too sure about that, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.186" offset="6068120">Now, as I say one of the reasons that's been urged for the overruling of the Williams case has been this alleged disregard of the earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.530" offset="6125484">I just part -- tried to meet it if I may, the objections that have been made to the Williams case and the reasons that it have been urged here for the overruling of the Williams case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.161" offset="6164041">The first has been, as I suggested, that the Williams case did not follow the previous statements of observation of this Court with respect to the Court of Claims but I say that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.879" offset="6214928">It's true that there were observations and statements made by courts with respect to the Court of Claims and being a -- an Article III or constitutional court but it was only in Bakelite and in Williams that you have the square presentation of the issue and the consideration of the question and where the question was fully mooted and fully considered and decided by unanimous court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.613" offset="6321821">Now, it has also been urged that Williams should be overruled for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.133" offset="6363930">It is urged that in the Williams case, it was stated by the unanimous court there that in addition to the fact that the Court of Claims performed solely congre -- congressional matters, susceptible to congressional dissemination, that in that case, it was stated by Mr. Justice Sutherland that in view of the fact that the courts up here -- that the United States District Courts did not have jurisdiction in those cases where the United States was a defendant under that clause reading controversies to which the United States shall be a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.532" offset="6549504">It was stated with reference to that clause in Section 2 of Article III by Mr. Justice Sutherland that under that clause, the United States could not be sued in courts created by Congress under Article III because it was not contemplated that the United States would be a defendant and it's through to that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.711" offset="6658173">Now, the fact is, however, that in the Williams case, the statements made by Mr. Justice Sutherland were completely unnecessary to that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.754" offset="6702373">There had been a full determination and discussion made by the court with respect to the fact that the Court of Claims was a -- an Article I congressional court sitting at the whim and will of Congress, performing the work of Congress, relieving Congress of its burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.853" offset="6786800">And the fact that it was unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.146" offset="6799966">The fact that it was dictum was pointed out by Mr. Chief Justice Vinson in the Tidewater case, pointed out in the footnote at page 640, pointed out that the discussion there and this Mr. Justice Black joined in this particular opinion, it was pointed out that that statement by Mr. Justice Sutherland was unnecessary and was dictum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.373" offset="7252825">In 1953, the Congress enacted an amendment to Section 171 of Title 28 of the United States Code by enacting an additional sentence to provide that the Court of Claims is hereby declared to be a court established to organize whatever particular work was under Article III that was in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.285" offset="7376541">In 1956, and again by additional legislation in 1958, the Congress enacted legislation which came out in the form of Section 293 (a) of Title 28 of the Judicial Code to provide that the Chief Justice could decide a justice of the Court of Claim or a judge of the Court of Claims to serve on a United States Court of Appeals as was done in this case with respect to Mr. -- to Judge Madden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.979" offset="7527320">Now, it is our intention that that declaration by Congress in 1953 was a mere declaration without any effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.382" offset="7596910">The legislation of 1953 did not undertake to enlarge the powers or the functions of the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.804" offset="7638601">It did nothing but spell out this statement a label that that it wanted to give to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.830" offset="7674650">It gave this label or gave this additional amendment to Section 171 for the reason of attempting to repudiate this Court's determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.393" offset="7732955">This Court's ruling with respect to the constitutional applications of the Act in effect in 1932 which Mr. -- Judge Williams attempted to have declared unconstitutional in the Williams case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.508" offset="7805367">Now, what Congress has done, they said, we will supersede the Supreme Court of United States and we will interpret the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.396" offset="7840998">And we don't agree with what Supreme Court has said with respect to the Constitution and we're declaring the law to be so and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.121" offset="7871822">We say that is a repudiation, a futile attempt to repudiate the rulings of this Court with respect to the Constitution and is completely ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.150" offset="7916022">We say it's also ineffective for this reason, that in making this declaration in 1953, as I stated before, the Congress did not enlarge the powers or functions in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.906" offset="8002957">It's been our contention here that the powers and the functions of a court are the characteristics which determine whether it is an Article I or Article III Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.498" offset="8061367">That was the test that was laid down in Bakelite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.904" offset="8070980">In that case, Mr. Justice Van Devanter stated that the test is not what in -- what the intention of Congress was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.611" offset="8109850">It was what was the actual jurisdiction conferred on a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.595" offset="8129703">What were the powers?</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.688" offset="8134092">What were the functions conferred upon a court?</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.816" offset="8150601">Those were the factors which determine its character as an Article I or in Article III court and not what Congress intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="2778.701" offset="11218213">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.869" offset="11234826">I should like to address myself preliminarily to the question as to whether the question which this petitioner has raised in this Court for the first time, is a question that he can't raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.477" offset="11305253">And for that purpose, we associate ourselves fully with the argument made by Solicitor General in the Lurk case that the issue of Judge Madden's competence to sit in the Court of Appeals for Second Circuit has been waived by not being raised in that court when the appeal was heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.848" offset="11410787">May I indicate to this Court the extent of the neglect of this petitioner to raise that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.698" offset="11450180">The appeal was argued in the Court of Appeals on February the 8th, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.027" offset="11475466">The petition for certiorari was filed in this Court on July 21st, five months and 13 days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.848" offset="11514755">That was the first time this issue was raised by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.044" offset="11543594">It is no answer for the petitioner to say, "We weren't aware of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.495" offset="11565328">We didn't know about the issue being raised in the Lurk case."</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.779" offset="11594480">The fact is that the issue came up first in the Bakelite case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.158" offset="11616005">That was decided in 1929 and reported in the official reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.193" offset="11640142">It was followed by the Williams case in 1933 that was, likewise, reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.294" offset="11664593">And that was followed by the comment which has been quoted from the Sherwood case in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.176" offset="11696044">And I think it's no answer from my adversary to say that he was unaware of what this Court said in these several cases as an excuse for not having raised that issue before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.023" offset="11751424">Now, the public policy phase of this question, I think, is also relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.985" offset="11787264">The Administrative Office of the United States Court in answer to an inquiry by me indicated on the date of December 26, 1961 that three judges of the Court of Claims have from time to time been assigned by the Chief Justice to sit in the various Courts of Appeal both in the District of Columbia and in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.827" offset="11906696">The only statistics available as to the number of cases which they heard and participated in decision apply only for the year 1961 at which time the record indicates that Judge Madden in a period of one week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.450" offset="11997184">We can question where this particular case was argued during that one week where which statistics are available participated in 18 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.915" offset="12039084">Now, if we follow my adversary's position, that there is a jurisdictional defect in the sitting of Judge Madden and the assignment of Judge Madden to Court of Appeals and that that jurisdictional defect can be raised at any time five months and 13 days later as it was in this case for five years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.005" offset="12127378">Then of course, the decisions in all of these cases would be of no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.242" offset="12148381">And the questions could be raised by a motion to vacate the judgments.</text>

            <text syncTime="3026.231" offset="12208253">There -- there are no statistics available to us although we've made inquiry which might not indicate that that's situation might prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.027" offset="12239496">But, I think it's mere coincidence that you have this situation of one judge dissenting with Judge Madden being part of the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.589" offset="12277739">I think that's pure coincidence because if the question should have been raised then as a matter of a public policy that I believe disposes of the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="4361.404" offset="17549040">If they don't arise in that fashion, of course, Congress could do otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.983" offset="17567326">And that was always the attitude of this Court for a period of 101 years from Canter until Bakelite from 1828 until 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.366" offset="17612884">There was no deviation at all in the attitude of that court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4403.087" offset="17715702">And -- and this Court in 1828 carved out for the first time this concept of a legislative court which would apply and which they did apply to courts in territories and to counsel of courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.212" offset="17784247">But for 101 years, that principle was not extended until the issue came up in Bakelite and in Williams.</text>

            <text syncTime="4519.392" offset="18180890">In the Williams opinion and in the Bakelite opinion, the Court never touched upon the question of the judicial power as it extended to all cases arising under the laws of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4535.198" offset="18244211">But clearly here was a broader, a broader scope for the grant of judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.960" offset="18279215">And I say that the Court of Claims is dealing constantly with cases which arise under the laws of the United States and it does all of the other things that any other court could do with the jurisdiction that it exercise are under appropriate legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.691" offset="18346088">And the mere circumstance that it's an act of Congress doesn't differentiate the Court of Claims from the District Court or the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="5118.151" offset="20576005">The authority of the Indian Claims Commissions to make the words to the Indians, as I understand it, and I think I'm right with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.690" offset="20622085">I'd -- I don't want to go too far in assuring the Court of things that I've -- have only a general idea about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.571" offset="20649671">As I understand it, the Indian Claims Commission, may make awards to the Indians on grounds that would not be applicable in a suit between Your Honor and myself or other private citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.131" offset="20707871">And it therefore occurred to me when the question was asked earlier about setting up a court to hear claims of the Indians that if they -- it had the full power that the Indian Claims Commission does but then it would seem to me that it was not the type of case or controversy or the type of judicial business that the framers of the Constitution had in mind when they wrote Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.623" offset="20813824">And that therefore, a man appointed to sit whatever term he was given by Congress would not be entitled to the security that Article III gives to a federal judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="5549.311" offset="22300609">It's not only concerned with cases or controversies but that these are cases or controversies to which the United States is a party or in the other event which arise under the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.702" offset="22362154">I think that it's quite clear that they fall under both heads of Article III power and in that respect that the Williams case was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.848" offset="22410742">Furthermore, I would emphasize one other thing about the nature of the Court of Claims' business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.440" offset="22437177">It's been suggested during the argument by Mr. Bordeau and by Mr. Gressman last week, that a court cannot be an Article III court unless it hears some cases that must be heard by courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.437" offset="22497155">Apparently, they've conceived of two kinds of judicial power, one which only Article III courts can exercise and another which Article III courts can but don't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.790" offset="22542503">Now, some of the business of the Court of Claims, it seems to me, is the kind -- involves the kind of question, which this Court has held, must be the subject of a judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.278" offset="22588479">I have in mind particularly the cases where the United States is sued for a taking not by eminent domain but simply by a superior force, the Standard Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.633" offset="22637902">The early case of the Monongahela Navigation Company, this Court said that the determination of what is just compensation is peculiarly a judicial function and must be det -- must be made in the last instance by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.733" offset="22706343">So that we think on this account, the Court of Claims clearly exercises judicial power in the ordinary sense of looking to see what it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.718" offset="22750229">It's also plain that the Court is organized in the manner and has the powers including the contempt powers and subpoena power which go to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.851" offset="22794742">And I would emphasize third that its judgments every since the Act of 1866 have been final and binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.111" offset="22831835">It is true that the Court has no power to levy execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.435" offset="22857122">The payment depends of a -- upon Congress passing in appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5694.837" offset="22882722">And there is a suggestion in the opinion prepared by Chief Judge -- Justice Taney in the Gordon case that -- that was the -- that the lack of power to levy execution was the fault in the 1863 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5712.880" offset="22954924">Indeed, he dwelt on that somewhat more, I think, than he did on the power of the Secretary of the Treasury to revise.</text>
