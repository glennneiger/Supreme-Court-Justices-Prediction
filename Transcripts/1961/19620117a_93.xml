            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Terris</label>
            <text syncTime="9.840" offset="142712">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.990" offset="155355">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.495" offset="177403">The sole issue in the case is whether the Government can appeal from an order of the District Court, granting the respondent's pre-indictment motion to suppress evidence, when the order is entered in the district other than the district of indictment and trial, the -- the motion both for the suppression of evidence and for the return of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.093" offset="263711">The relevant facts are the respondent was arrested by FBI agents on September 29th, 1959 in Miami, Florida and charged with the robbery of a federally insured bank in Ohio, approximately a month earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.952" offset="339153">The arrest was based upon a warrant which was issued in the Southern District of Ohio which was later found to be invalid and on information known to the arresting officers which was later found to constitute probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.442" offset="401115">Incident to the arrest, the respondent's house was searched and large sums of money and other items were seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.097" offset="435806">On October 9th, 1959, a final hearing was held before the United States Commissioner in the Southern District of Florida on the Ohio complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.818" offset="482617">On October 12, 3 days later, the respondent filed a motion for the suppression of the evidence which was seized and for its return in the Southern District of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.877" offset="530892">On October 16th, four days after the filing of the motion, an indictment was returned in the Southern District of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.611" offset="565791">And subsequently on December 18th, the District Court for the Southern District of Florida granted the respondent's motion to suppress the materials seized as evidence on the ground that the search and seizure were unreasonable, even though that the officers had probable cause to make the arrest but denied respondent's motion for the return of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.012" offset="651368">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed the Government's appeal from the order of suppression on the ground that it was an interlocutory order in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.947" offset="699120">In the petition for certiorari in this case, the Government contended that the decision of the court below was erroneous and that the order of the District Court was appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.793" offset="742588">In preparing our brief in the DiBella case, we -- we reevaluated our position to regard to the appealability of orders deciding motions to suppress generally and we've concluded that the decision of the court below in this case, dismissing the Government's appeal was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.444" offset="825135">I will first consider the order of the District Court as if it had been made in the district of indictment and trial instead of in the district of seizure which turned out not to be the district of indictment and trial and will contend that it would not have been appealable if it had been made in the district of indictment and trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.223" offset="904234">I will then argue that it makes no difference that the order was entered in a district other than that of indictment and trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.641" offset="941955">In the DiBella case, I indicate and I repeat now that we think none of the older cases, in the Perlman case, the Burdeau case, Cogen, Go-Bart which are the only cases which even bear on this subject, are holdings contrary to the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.898" offset="1006947">While they tend against the Government's position and there's very little at any discussion in these cases, we do not think that they are controlling in view of the Court's more recent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.312" offset="1052609">In the Wallace Company case in 336 United States, this Court stated with regard to appealability, whether a motion is to be treated as independent and plenary or as merely a procedural step in a pending trial must be determined by particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.683" offset="1122095">We think this indicates that no mechanical rule should be applied and then again in the Carroll case, which is the most recent decision of this Court in this area, the Court emphasized in considering a Government appeal of an order granting a motion filed -- granting a motion to suppress filed after the indictment was returned unlike here in the DiBella where motion was filed before indictment that fragmentary appeals are not favored and “The delays in the prosecution of criminal cases are numerous and lengthy enough without sanctioning appeals that are not plainly authorized by statute.”</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="290.835" offset="1266709">Now, this one had brought to attention to the fact that in the Carroll opinions had occasion to say, I think it's not without significance in referring to the earlier case, earlier cases illustrated sometimes without inspection.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="307.249" stopTime="377.014">
            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Terris</label>
            <text syncTime="307.249" offset="1332328">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.268" offset="1336404">Precisely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.130" offset="1339852">Now, that -- that statement was -- has been cited -- the state -- the statement in Carroll that the earlier cases decided that motions made before indictment are -- are appealable and motions made in the district other than the district of indictment and trial are appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.998" offset="1415398">At that state -- those statements have been cited for the proposition when numerous Courts of Appeals and in -- and in DiBella case by the petitioner for the proposition that -- that in those situations that the appeal is automatically allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.686" offset="1482167">We -- we think however, that the Court in -- in Carroll did not decide even in dictum which there would have been such a proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.222" offset="1508289">It merely alluded to the earlier cases and did not have to consider them because that wasn't the issue which was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.215" offset="1544234">The principle which the Government is contending for in both DiBella and in this case is that orders deciding motions under Rule 41 should not be appealable unless they decide important interest of the movement which are separate from the criminal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.151" offset="1732002">But we think he is wrong on the proposition that is binding or res judicata.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.141" offset="2779930">I'd like now to consider the basic principle for which we've argued in the DiBella case and here in -- in five different situations, all involving pre-indictment motions to suppress and or seeking the return of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.552" offset="2841579">First, we have the situation in DiBella where -- where the movement asked only with the suppression of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.368" offset="2864880">We think that there's no possible way that that kind of a motion could be independent of a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.849" offset="2886719">The second situation is where the motion asked for the return of the items seized but the property is contraband so he's clearly not enti -- so that moving clearly isn't en -- entitled to the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.878" offset="2930918">So that in this case too we think that the motion is merely one for suppression even though it's labeled as also asking for return and the motion is not independent of the criminal case no matter when it is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.496" offset="2985357">The third situation is where the motion asked for the return of property which may or may not be returnable to the movement even if it was illegally seized depending on the outcome of the criminal trial and I like to give an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.764" offset="3042408">For exa -- the -- the issue whether the property involved is contraband or is stolen often depends on the outcome of the criminal trial if -- in fact that's -- that's the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.174" offset="3096116">The money which was seized, the Government contends was stolen and therefore the movement isn't entitled -- the respondent isn't entitled to it -- to the return of this money even assuming that it was illegally seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.249" offset="3140420">So there too, in that kind of a situation we think even though the motion asked for both return and suppression, it is an -- is in essence only a motion asking for suppression and that therefore it is not independent of the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.482" offset="3201337">And the fourth situation is where the motion asked both for suppression and return but the movement has an insubstantial property interest in the materials which were seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.541" offset="3241566">An example of that would be copies of documents which he doesn't -- with -- in which he has the original documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.576" offset="3265703">There's no need for him to get them back immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.022" offset="3275421">Of course, he would be entitled to it -- to the return after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.587" offset="3293706">We think that such -- that an order deciding that kind of a motion is not appealable since the movement's property interest is so unimportant that it -- that his plea for return does not make that portion of the motion an independent proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.724" offset="3354311">The last situation is where the movement asked prior to indictment again for both return and suppression and valuable property rights are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.848" offset="3390777">Now in our brief, we suggested that that kind of a -- that that kind of a motion -- an order deciding that kind of a motion is appealable whenever it is made before indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.795" offset="5482559">We would -- we would think that if the respondent had an unchallenged right to the return of this money upon a finding that it was illegally seized, then that this proceeding would've been independent of a criminal case and the defendant would have been entitled to ap -- to appeal the refusal of the Court to return his property and the Government would've been entitled to ap -- to appeal the order of the -- of the District Court too.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.469" offset="5621217">The Government contends that this $14,000 is part of over $30,000 stolen in the bank robbery and therefore this issue must await the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.804" offset="5662595">And we think that as to this part of the motion, it is -- it is just -- it in essence asked only for suppression and not for return even though it labels -- the motion is labeled both for suppression and return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.996" offset="5711391">Now, there are some other --there is some other property involved and it's listed down on pages 15 and 16 of our brief, it's quite an extensive list but most of it is -- is extremely trivial royal -- of roles of coin wrappers and all things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.118" offset="5771891">Now, the most important items were a pistol, three pairs of slacks and a sport shirt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.971" offset="5875231">We think in other words, that his motion is based -- is basically a motion in the independent -- in this part of the criminal case, it is basically a motion asking for suppression and not for return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.275" offset="5944508">In conclusion, I would like to emphasize two -- two points, one is that if the Government is wrong in DiBella and the -- and the order of the District Court in that case is appealable then we think a fortiori the order of the District Court in this case was appealable by the Government that the only factors which are different between DiBella and this case tend to show that the order in this case was more -- was more final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.388" offset="6064880">The only two different factors are that here, the movement asked for both return and for suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.560" offset="6093615">In DiBella he asked only for suppression and here, the motion was not only prior to indictment, but it was in a -- it was in a district other than the district of indictment and trial and we think both those factors tend to make it more final of those I've emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.266" offset="6160488">We do not think that it was a final decision that neither order either in DiBella or in this case was appealable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.894" offset="6874990">I guess the respondent in this case enjoys a rather unique position because directly, and perhaps to some extent, directly the petitioner is trying to help our cause before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.079" offset="6919711">However, I am now justly confused and I'm not going to rely with the briefs or notes any further and just pretend them back down the lower court's arguing the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.898" offset="6959000">The issue was then and I hope it is now as to whether or not an order relative to a motion to suppress evidence which was filed prior to the return over the indictment and in the district different from the district of trial would be appealable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.096" offset="7315728">He is freighted through his living room, through his family into the kitchen in ordered to sit down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.449" offset="7345194">At that time, may it please this Court, they ran into the front door, they ran into the back door, they climbed in through the windows, ten agents of the FBI.</text>

            <text syncTime="1900.112" offset="7703803">This Court has gone out and stated that the start of a criminal action is very apparent when an indictment is returned and when an information is filed, but it also starts at the very least when a commissioner's warrant is issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.199" offset="7760123">Now, what is the difference of a cow as the cow here, can it ever become a bull?</text>

            <text syncTime="1922.726" offset="7794291">I'm talking now perhaps in a lower court fashion, but I'm greatly concerned, we can't be playing around with words and semantic problems of -- of any sort when it comes to something as fierce as this, 25 years of a man's freedom at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.782" offset="7858552">My client isn't concerned, if I have to move back and tell him, “Well, I'm sorry, this is not a criminal case our fighting to stop this evidence from being used against you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.895" offset="7898990">The law is logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.017" offset="7907453">The law has to follow from the statute of const -- from the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.464" offset="7921246">There must be some reason in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.476" offset="7929292">It's as simple as that and when it comes to rights of appeals which are not inherent, in our jurisprudence none whatsoever, strictly statutory and safely guard and limit it, especially when it comes to the Government, we must follow those rules of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.958" offset="7995225">And now what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.423" offset="8001076">In the rights to appeal by the Government, it's extremely limited when it comes to a criminal case under Title 18, whatever the proper number may be and this Court is familiar with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.133" offset="8039946">They can only appeal for motions to dismiss that have been granted against them or for judgments in arrest of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.300" offset="8064606">They can't appeal from a judgment of acquittal, which is the vaguest thing any defense lawyer this client has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.237" offset="8088325">They can't appeal from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.734" offset="8094281">And yet, they file a decision, the most final known under the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.696" offset="8118105">But under Title 28, anyone can appeal from final decisions including defendants in criminal cases but not the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.905" offset="8151019">And this Court has so held because the criminal statutes are limiting their rights to appeal when it comes to the Government.</text>
