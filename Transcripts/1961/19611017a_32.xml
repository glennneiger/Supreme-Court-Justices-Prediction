            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 32, Charles Clarence Hamilton, Petitioner, versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.528" offset="165491">Mrs. Motley.</text>

            <label>Ms. Constance B. Motley</label>
            <text syncTime="17.297" offset="172596">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.437" offset="193076">This case is here pursuant to the provisions of Title 28, United States Code Section 13 -- Section 1257 (3), petitioner having asserted below in here rights secured by the constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.010" offset="275414">The rights asserted below and here are rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution specifically the unqualified right to counsel in every stage of the capital case and the right to a trial on a capital charge which afforded the petitioner a fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.346" offset="380740">Now, this case is here for the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.677" offset="398085">Petitioner first sought to have this Court review his case during the October 1959 term when he petitioned this Court to grant a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama affirming his conviction on a charge of burglary with intent to ravish for which he had been sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.789" offset="506546">In that petition, the petitioner claimed, as he now claims, that he had been denied due process of law in that he had not had counsel at the time of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.054" offset="563597">And in that he was denied the fundamentals of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.315" offset="584600">On his appeal from his conviction to the Supreme Court of Alabama, he made this same claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.210" offset="616260">Now with respect to the first claims, the Supreme Court of Alabama ruled that it had no quarrel with the petitioner's claims right to counsel in a capital case where the accused is unable to afford counsel and the petitioner's claim of right to counsel at the time of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.767" offset="698389">But the court ruled that these principles were without application to the case before it because the record on its face read that the petitioner was represented by counsel at the time of the arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.913" offset="763068">Petitioner sought to prove by reference to a certified copy of the bench notes of the trial judge that he had not in fact then represented by a counsel at the time of his arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.312" offset="824613">But the Supreme Court of Alabama ruled that the state law precluded impeachment of the minute entry of record which showed that counsel was present at the time of arraignment and at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.995" offset="887306">In his October petition to this Court from that ruling of the Supreme Court of Alabama, petitioner asked this Court to find as a fact that he did not have counsel at the time of arraignment, that this deprived him of due process of law, and that the conduct of the trial in view of the representations of this petitioner by his court-appointed counsel among other things did not make due process requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.916" offset="1011022">Now, in opposition to that first petition for certiorari in 1959, the State of Alabama filed a brief in opposition thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.336" offset="1052714">And on pages five and six of that brief, the state said this, “The burden is not on the State of Alabama to explain the fancy inconsistency as to why the minute entry of the record shows that the defendant did have counsel at his arraignment and yet his trial counsel was apparently appointed three days later.”</text>
            <text syncTime="261.500" offset="1149367">Actually, the counsel in the particular case have appointed quite some time prior to the official judgment entry to defend the petitioner on a previous indictment and remained assigned as counsel to the defendant throughout and including the day of arraignment on the second indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.818" offset="1218644">The two entries of judgment are not in conflict and the statement by the petitioner that the defendant was deprived of counsel at the time of his arraignment is pure conjecture on the part of the petitioner's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.131" offset="1283845">Then Alabama pointed out that however, petitioner still had available to him another remedy to attack the judgment entry in this case with extrinsic matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.326" offset="1340688">That method it said was by writ of error coram nobis.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.934" offset="1359078">This Court refused to review that decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama affirming his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.855" offset="1410800">Now after that, the petitioner then filed in the Supreme Court of Alabama a petition for leave to file a writ of error coram nobis in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.483" offset="1457298">In that petition he alleged that he had been indicted on November 9th, 1956 for the crime of burglary in the nighttime with intent to steal.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.692" offset="1502124">Arraigned on this charge on January 4th, 1957 at which time his counsel Mr. Mayfield was appointed and entered a plea of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.269" offset="1548413">Trial was set for January 14th, 1957 but was passed four times until April 24th, 1957 when the case was now crossed on recommendation of the Solicitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.173" offset="1604106">Now in this petition for leave to file a writ of error coram nobis, petitioner also pointed out that on February 12, 1957 before the first indictment was nolle pros, he was indicted the second time by the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.682" offset="1682056">This time he was indicted for burglary with intent to steal in one count and burglary with intent to ravish.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.023" offset="1731480">He was arraigned on this second indictment on March 1st, 1957 at which time he again pleaded not guilty but this time without the aid, advice or representation of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.767" offset="1790412">Counsel is not appointed for him he alleged until March 4th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.903" offset="1814967">Now this allegation was supported by the affidavit of the petitioner's trial counsel which was attached to his petition in which he stated that to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, he was not present at the arraignment on March 1st and that he did not advise or consult with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.436" offset="1901066">In addition to the affidavit which was submitted by the petitioner (Inaudible) counsel, the State of Alabama submitted an affidavit from the trial counsel in which he again said that he had been appointed to represent the petitioner with respect to his first indictment, later nolle pros, and that on March 4th, 1957, he was appointed to represent petitioner with respect to the second indictment that is three days after the second arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.498" offset="2041396">That he knew of the indictment prior to its being returned by the grand jury, that he was aware of the second indictment and arraignment which he stated occurred on March 1st, 1957 that he considered himself as representing the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.608" offset="2109837">And that the arraignment was done with his knowledge and consent although he was not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.337" offset="2140766">He alleged that he would not have entered any different plea from the plea of guilty entered by petitioner had he been at the arraignment, and finally he alleged that he considered the arraignment a mere formality, since the same plea would have been entered which was entered on the first arraignment, and that this was his reason for not representing petitioner on March 1st on his second arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.864" offset="2246823">Now in addition to these two affidavits, there was a third affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.588" offset="2265736">This one was filed by the deputy second Solicitor who prosecuted the case in which he alleged that he had spoken to the Mr. Mayfield, the petitioner's court-appointed counsel informing him that there no indictment was being procured and later told him that the new two count indictments had been returned and that the petitioner would be arraigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.422" offset="2361031">However, none of these affidavits indicates whether Mr. Mayfield actually sought the second indictment with the more serious crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.143" offset="2403976">The prosecutor alleged that the --</text>

            <text syncTime="693.197" offset="2876165">Now upon considering petitioner's application in which all of these facts were alleged for leave to file a writ of error coram nobis, the Supreme Court of Alabama held that the petitioner had followed the proper procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.425" offset="2941053">It also found as a fact that petitioner was not represented by counsel at time of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.294" offset="2972505">It ruled that it was not bound by the minute entries that had been on the appeal and so they could find this as a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.731" offset="3006255">The Alabama Court then held that the law of the state placed upon the trial court the obligation to see that the petitioner here had counsel because this was a capital offense and that he had such counsel before he was arraigned and called upon to plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.206" offset="3088175">It pointed out that there was no decision in Alabama expressly so ruling but that this had been the almost uniform practice of the Circuit Courts of Alabama for many years and that the very purpose of the statute would seem to dictate such action.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.458" offset="3221191">The Alabama Court acknowledged this Court's decision of course in Powell against Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 and held that the right to counsel is not a right confined to representation during the trial on the merits citing this Court's decision in Moore against Michigan, that's 355 U.S. 155.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.033" offset="3307499">However, it ruled that in this case, there was no denial of due process since the petitioner had failed to show that he was not prejudiced by the absence of counsel at his arraignment.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.812" offset="3770598">Now this Court -- this petitioner now asked this Court to review this judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.610" offset="3801840">The record filed in this case with this new petitioner causes supplemented by the record which was filed here in 1959 with the first petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.069" offset="3867669">And petitioner asked this Court to take judicial notice of that record as the Supreme Court of Alabama might have done upon its review of petitioner's request for leave to file a writ of error coram nobis.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.220" offset="3924302">Now this record shows that the petitioner, an indigent Negro was convicted by the courts of Alabama of burglary with intent to ravish and sentenced to death on April 23rd, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.912" offset="3986996">Now the testimony on the trial I think is far from clear but it shows that the petitioner was convicted on the night of October 12th, 1956 or the early morning hours of October 13th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.025" offset="4051466">At that time, petitioner was found in the bedroom of an elderly white woman in Ensley, Alabama by the woman's grandson by marriage who live in the same house who testified that petitioner was indecently exposed when found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.351" offset="4116773">The petitioner testified that he was summoned into the house by the woman who gave him the impression that she had been robbed and sought help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.095" offset="4159718">He testified that he could not understand her because he spoke with a foreign accent, and that whenever he attempted to leave, she prevented him because she insisted on his helping her, whatever her plight might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.819" offset="4218650">The grandchildren called the police who arrested the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.527" offset="4233488">There was some testimony concerning the lock on the door of the room which petitioner was found -- in which petitioner was found, a door which led from the porch into the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.766" offset="4278418">But it was not demonstrated that this lock had been broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.444" offset="4293151">It appears that while the windows and doors had been secured and so forth, the door in the porch was open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.896" offset="4318960">In addition, although there was testimony that the petitioner was indecently exposed, Mrs. Giangrosso, the elderly woman who was the alleged intended victim of the rape did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.045" offset="4375594">Petitioner's counsel called her for testimony during the trial but since she had not been subpoenaed she did not appear and no effort was made to secure her attendance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.726" offset="4418226">There was no evidence that there was any rape, violence or physical injury at any time which occurred to alleged intended victim or anyone else, neither was there evidence that petitioner had any weapons, burglary tools or the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.042" offset="4483532">Now, the trial of this capital case have started at 11 o'clock in the morning and terminated at 4:10 in the afternoon with an hour and 40 minutes for lunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.855" offset="4522820">When the case came on for trial the petitioner got up and said to the trial court, “This is not my lawyer, he was appointed by the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.804" offset="4570572">The trial counsel then got up and asked to withdraw from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.510" offset="4597426">All of these occurred in the presence of the jury because petitioner had indicated his dissatisfaction with his counsel, the Court didn't inquire as to the basis of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.084" offset="4639744">He merely asked him if he had other counsels and he said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.412" offset="4653014">The Court then invited the petitioner to participate in his own defense and said that he could ask questions after the counsel had completed examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.009" offset="4699408">And during the course of the trial, the petitioner made a bungling, inept effort to defend himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.308" offset="4728560">He interrupted the Court and argued with witnesses for which he was reprimanded by the Court throughout the trial in the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.221" offset="4768266">The trial concluded with a lengthy charge to the jury which nowhere defined intent to ravish and to which no objections were taken by the trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.031" offset="4819466">Petitioner himself argued to the jury but as he said in his own words, he did not understand the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.797" offset="4850604">The verdict of course was guilty and the petitioner was sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.607" offset="4869831">Upon this review, petitioner claims first that his right to counsel in a capital case may not be qualified as the Supreme Court of Alabama has qualified it, by superimposing upon this right a requirement that he shows some qualitative disadvantage flowing from the denial of the right to counsel at time of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.622" offset="4981844">Petitioner also claims that even assuming for the purposes of this argument that a showing of disadvantage is required, the record in this case demonstrates that the petitioner was denied a fair hearing.</text>

            <label>Ms. Constance B. Motley</label>
            <text syncTime="1961.155" offset="7947995">Now, as I've pointed out, the law in Alabama is clear that he had this right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.691" offset="7974118">And that the right was qualified by Alabama by this ruling which it has made that in order to show a denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, the petitioner was found to show prejudice to him from this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.930" offset="8051127">Now, we say that the right to counsel in a capital case of this kind is so essential that it cannot be qualified as the Supreme Court of Alabama has qualified it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.510" offset="8105462">In so ruling, the Supreme Court of Alabama relied on several lower, federal, and state court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.567" offset="8141615">It also relied upon this Court's decision in Canizio against New York, 327 U.S. 82, a noncapital case in which the defendant who plead guilty was not represented by counsel at the time of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.242" offset="8208384">There this Court ruled that under the circumstances of that case, no denial of due process had been shown and then the Alabama Supreme Court relied on two other decisions of this Court, one, Gayes against New York, 332 U.S. 145, another noncapital case in which it was shown that the petitioner waived his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.556" offset="8297618">The same with the case of Quicksall against Michigan, 339 U.S.660 in a capital case on which Alabama relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.270" offset="8336488">But, there again, it was clear that the petitioner there had waived his right to counsel so that the Alabama Court did not have any decision of this Court on which to rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.824" offset="8378702">It relied upon cases of this Court which were either noncapital cases or cases at which the petitioner had actually waived his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.482" offset="8425305">Here of course, the petitioner was charged with a capital case and he certainly didn't waive his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.813" offset="8454666">And so we say that in a capital case of this kind, at every stage, it is so essential to have a counsel that to deprive him of counsel at the time of arraignment is in itself a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.003" offset="8515375">As Mr. Justice Stewart said in the concurring opinion in Spano against New York, 360 U.S. 315, at page 327, a case involving coerced confession in which the defendant was without counsel at the time, he confessed following indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.405" offset="8593011">Now, Mr. Justice Stewart said this, “Under our system of justice, an indictment is supposed to be followed by an arraignment and trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.115" offset="8623835">At every stage in those proceedings, the accused has an absolute right to a lawyer's help if the case is one in which the death penalty may be imposed”, citing Powell against Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.795" offset="8682559">What this Court said in Von Moltke against Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 723 is clearly applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.367" offset="8720802">Arraignment, this Court said is too important a step in a criminal proceeding to give such wholly inadequate representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.233" offset="8764270">Arraignment is considered so crucial as step in a criminal proceeding that in 19 states, the law provides for appointment of counsel for indigent defendants at arraignments in virtually all felony prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.705" offset="8822157">Now, in the appendix to appellee -- to this petitioner's brief, we have set forth all of the law of the various states on the right to counsel at time of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.533" offset="8873462">Under Alabama law, arraignment is the time to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity as we have pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.966" offset="8911287">And the failure to answer the plea at that time means that your right to do so is lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.451" offset="8941171">You may then make a motion which is then wholly within the discretion of the trial court and the Alabama Supreme Court has so ruled.</text>

            <label>Mr. George D. Mentz</label>
            <text syncTime="4624.074" offset="18599685">That is my personal interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.180" offset="18632077">Now, but in line with Canizio case, while it was discretionary with the trial court, the trial court nevertheless had the authority to grant any of these motions that I just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.250" offset="18720371">Now, furthermore, inasmuch as this Court refused to review a federal appellate court, amended 1955, the Court seemingly recognized the principle that representation by counsel at arraignment in a state court is not mandatory even in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.848" offset="18806784">I refer to State versus Sullivan in which the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that where an accused charged with murder entered a plea of not guilty and is immediately thereafter furnished with counsel for the preparation for the trial, for the trial itself, and proposed trial proceedings, that the sentenced rendered is not void.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.774" offset="18902497">In that case, the court found that there was a complete failure of any showing that at any juncture in the criminal case, the accused was denied any substantive or procedural right which might have been available to him except for such plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.115" offset="18979819">The court logically reasoned that the petitioner did not suffer any proscription or disadvantage arising out of the plea of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.251" offset="19012420">And therefore, that there was no violation of due process or any impingement of fundamental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.512" offset="19049409">And we submit that in this case that there is a somewhat situation, a comparable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.527" offset="19081488">While counsel was not appointed immediately, he was appointed three days later, after the arraignment, he was appointed 50 days prior to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.420" offset="19137076">And in line with State versus Sullivan, I think there's a very close analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.526" offset="19165497">And as I say, in his petition for coram nobis, he did not allege and he did not offer any evidence and the record doesn't show that he was injured by not having been represented by counsel at arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.629" offset="19253896">Now, as to the second question presented, it's our contention that the record in this case does not make such a showing a fundamental unfairness as to warrant a decision that the Alabama Supreme Court ordered the reversal and denying Hamilton's petition to coram nobis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.885" offset="19338951">Various tests have been applied in the determination of what constitutes fundamental unfairness, and they include the gravity of the offense, the nature and the complexity of the issues, the age of the accused, his mental capacity, which would embrace mental illness or feeblemindedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.734" offset="19430275">His background, including education and experience, ignorance or literacy, his knowledge of law, such as lack of familiarity with legal rights, capability of questioning witnesses, the degree of protection given during the trial as it appears from the conduct of the court or the prosecutor, or any other like inadequacy which makes the accused incapable of conducting his own defense in that particular stage of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.427" offset="19569037">Now as applied -- as we apply these tests to the present case, we admit of course that the offense was extremely grave.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.660" offset="19609997">But I am unable to see where the issues were complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.736" offset="19638314">As for his age, the record doesn't show how old he was but there's no claim of youthfulness and we know that he served in the army for five years.</text>

            <text syncTime="6282.597" offset="25233742">If the counsel has been present in the arraignment, the Court might have at that time, seen the conflict between counsel and the client, and then was the time to have made the change in counsel of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="6295.706" offset="25286196">But the lawyer was not there and this is one of our reason for saying arraignment is very important because this kind of thing, they come to light at the time of arraignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.228" offset="25328306">But all of the remarks made by the Court and this conflict or dissatisfaction with client and lawyer was all in the presence of the jury and what they concluded of course was mere speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6321.037" offset="25387551">But we say this kind of thing should not happen in the presence of the jury in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6328.679" offset="25418062">Another thing I'd like to clarify which was raised earlier in the argument with my -- my opponent, this petitioner never had a hearing on his coram nobis application, permission to file coram nobis in the trial court was denied by the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="6351.163" offset="25508028">So there was no hearing on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6352.982" offset="25515342">He made an application for leave to file a petition in the trial court which is a procedure in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="6359.693" offset="25542196">So that what was denied was the permission to file it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6364.881" offset="25562885">Now of course, petitioner says that arraignment is not a mere formality.</text>
            <text syncTime="6370.501" offset="25585351">The arraignment is a very, very important step in a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6375.557" offset="25605622">In this case, the charge shows that the petitioner here was presented with a charge involving complex legal and factual issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6388.245" offset="25656404">As was pointed, the code nowhere defined intent to ravish, yet that was the charge in the indictment to which he pled.</text>
