            <label>Mr. Burton Marks</label>
            <text syncTime="14.321" offset="160684">Thank you, Chief Justice and Associate Justices of this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.787" offset="178552">This case involves a dual question of the denial of effective -- of consistence of counsel to two indigent defendants at trial and at the appellate level, and as our contention that the petitioners were denied assistance of counsel and thus due process of law and equal protections of the law at both stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.945" offset="267160">Now, there are two different problems arising.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.165" offset="280012">And as far as I'm concern, only one problem as to each defendant as were arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.708" offset="302164">I think the ultimate question which is going to be involved is whether or not appellate justices are lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.256" offset="332361">And I think the answer to that question in the sense that I might define lawyer would be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.184" offset="356080">To go back to the original premises that at the trial, there was a very -- and I'm just going to go through that situation very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.868" offset="390875">An attorney who is appointed for both the defendants stood up and announced to the court that number one, he was not prepared to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.166" offset="420028">He had interviewed the defendants twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.810" offset="426611">I believe these were 13 felony accounts charged against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.597" offset="441762">And secondly, he declared that there was a conflict of interest, I believe the -- Mr. Mitchelson's explanation of why there was a conflict of intere -- interest at a later date, well, he illuminated to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.076" offset="495679">However, I think there's no argument in the court that the Fifth and Fourteenth of Amend -- Amendments of the Constitution as they include the Sixth Amendments define what effective assistance of counsel means.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.825" offset="546670">One is that you must be, as a counsel, prepared to defend your client.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.972" offset="567254">And I think that was enunciated in our California courts, People versus Madison, which is cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.435" offset="593063">And second is that you are -- to be effective counsel, you must be able to devote your entire zeal, energy and devotion to the cause of a single client and if there -- if you cannot do that then you cannot give effective assistance of counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.085" offset="831718">I do know that they are constantly in court each and everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.464" offset="845197">They do have at least one case a day if not at trial a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.552" offset="857631">After they are finished with their trials, they go to the county jail and interview their clients for the next day.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.446" offset="993155">Now, if the attorney is not prepared and has a good and valid excuse then I think a reason for not being able to be prepared and that is an extraordinary case load then I think that it would be an abusive discretion for the court to say that he was prepared.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.735" offset="3626297">And then these people were found out by the police and came in and testify then some of their testimony was not too reputable.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.682" offset="3654092">And as I understand from Mr. Michelson, a great deal of cross-examination was involved in these witnesses to discredit them and impeach them.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.501" offset="3685334">And it seems to be supported by the fact that the prosecution's theory of murder by lying in wait because of these enormous number of prior robberies and the defendants knew they were going to be apprehended and therefore, they were lying in wait to kill the police officer didn't materialize.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.686" offset="3738102">Apparently, the jury just didn't buy that theory of -- the prior robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.569" offset="3761612">Now, if you're going to go into these new 13 felonies and you're going to have to be very well-acquainted with the prior cross-examination of the witness is in also the fact of alibis if the defendants have them and how you could confirm the alibis by other independent witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.228" offset="3832247">And that's why I say it's more difficult because there were 13 counsels altogether, different things -- different robberies of different occasions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1064.085" offset="4359711">Well, that was the first motion made, the very first motion that Mr. Atkins made was to disqualify the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.418" offset="4381027">He asked, “May we approach the bench?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.128" offset="4395865">And page 29, Mr. Atkins, “Your Honor, we have filed the affidavit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.017" offset="4419480">And that is the very first motion he made so it couldn't have been a secondary thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.316" offset="4432645">I'm sure it was a first thought in the defendant's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.618" offset="4445811">When they talked to Mr. Atkins, they didn't want to have Judge Rhone try the case because Judge Rhone had tried the first murder case and I understand that there had been some sort of conflict going on between prosecution and defense at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.354" offset="4500773">Now, getting to the second portion, our judges, appellate judges and lawyers, I referred to Mr. Goertzen, the respondent's brief where he states on page 46, “The safe to assert that counsel for petitioners would,” that's me, “If you were an indigent defender rather have his trial record reviewed for possible error by a group of experienced appellant justices where conscience is to a fault.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.877" offset="4586872">That was my words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.121" offset="4591888">And have the said record assigned to a private practicing counsel whom he treats as court appointment with irritation and undue hazed as many do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.035" offset="4619473">Now, I take great -- I'm abridging that and I disagree greatly because I sincerely believe that I would rather have a novitiate attorney review my record on appeal, if I were in that position, than any appellate justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.121" offset="4671822">The reason for that is because appellate justices are not advocates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.524" offset="4689481">They are not out to look at the record to determine error and find the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.872" offset="4710902">They are there to -- they -- there's a different slant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.924" offset="4727097">They're judges and they don't advocate a cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.294" offset="4740577">And I'll also -- I will take another abridge of the fact that private practicing counsel treat a court upon with irritation because in Los Angeles County, we volunteer into the appellate courts, so we submit our names and we are appointed from this list and the situation which occurred is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.751" offset="4810376">A court will -- a court clerk will call us up and say, “Would you like to take a look at a particular case?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.551" offset="4833573">And you say, he's certainly send over the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.877" offset="4842872">So, either we pick up the record or they send it over and then we spent some time or eye view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.941" offset="4863143">I look over the record very carefully to see whether or not I can find any error which I think might be risk and I'm not looking for suspicious error and I'm not trying to -- if there is anything which I think could be raised, I will then write to the court and say, “Please appoint me because I'm going to take it” or just call the clerk as it maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.857" offset="4934823">If I think that the record is error free or if I think that there is possibly part of the record that isn't apt that might contain error, I may ask for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.855" offset="4970768">In any case, if I don't think there is any error, I will so inform the court and ask that I'd be relieved as appointed counsel and ask for no fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.275" offset="5008488">If I think there's error, I write a brief and maybe I'm wrong, which I usually am, and it's affirmed however then you will ask for reasonable fees to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.184" offset="5052061">But I do not think that this same practice is employed by an appellate justice no matter how conscientious he maybe in reviewing a record because he is looking at it from a judges' view point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.645" offset="5093961">He isn't looking for error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.267" offset="5100440">And I think an outstanding example of that fact is that error which to me was patent and egregious that is a conflict of interest, it's denial of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.605" offset="5149759">On that ground alone was -- was completely passed over by the appellate justice who reviewed the court -- review the record and only brought up by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.795" offset="5198555">As a matter of fact, and after it was brought up by the Attorney General, never mentioned the end of the decision of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.663" offset="5222066">And again, when the defendant took his petition for review up to the California Supreme Court, I know that he didn't have this specification of the error in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.484" offset="5261354">Perhaps, the Supreme Court might have reviewed it on that ground but it wasn't there -- it wasn't presented in a proper form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.781" offset="5286536">It's true that the brief covered practically everything, every legal point that you want to consider but it was a hodgepodge of legal justification such as a grand jury indictment which is not applicable in the state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1439.202" offset="5860185">We have Mr. Douglas who had previously been represented by a private attorney and then ran -- assume ran out of funds, who would obviously have the right to have a private counsel appointed for him if there was a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.049" offset="5919535">I don't think that the inquiry should go any further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.664" offset="5934059">Now, assuming that he had the right to have a private counsel appointed for him and Meyes didn't, still, Meyes and Douglas would have the right to have a short continuance and they weren't asking for a long continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.451" offset="5989125">I don't think anywhere in the record that shows that they -- these tactics were dilatory because in one portion of the record, they said one week would be alright but give us a chance to prepare or give us -- our attorney a chance to prepare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.415" offset="6041057">And so they were asking for a short continuance in order to prepare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.298" offset="6056521">And nowhere in the record could I find any place where the people were objecting that the continuance would put them to a disadvantage because already this case had been going out as I believe over a year and a half since the first inception of the murder trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.015" offset="6119424">So a short delay wasn't going to effect their prejudice to people's point and that was never the argument of Mr. Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.870" offset="6146800">His argument was not that we're going to be pre -- prejudiced but the -- the defendants are trying to be dilatory and they're raising these suspicious motions for defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.023" offset="6187447">I think the judge just -- maybe he took abridge of the fact that an affidavit of prejudice was filed against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.631" offset="6225899">Although, it's never intended that specific way some judges do but maybe his back was up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.964" offset="6255261">In any case, with re -- the last point is, with respect to the transcripts on appeal, again, we have a very peculiar situation and especially, with respect to the appellate review and how it happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.004" offset="6307401">Now, Mr. Meyes was filing briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.945" offset="6319104">They both asked for counsel on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.276" offset="6328508">They both asked -- well, Douglas asked for a separate transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.019" offset="6343450">And he was 119 miles away from Meyes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.325" offset="6376678">He could have gone up to the appellate court and taken their transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.689" offset="6390157">Or if he'd been given the transcript, maybe he could have prepared his own brief.But he wasn't given any either.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.536" offset="6557550">Now, as far as an additional transcript is concerned, in the beginning, it -- it only means that a -- the reporter need insert an additional page, copy in his typewriter in order to produce another copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.222" offset="6624214">Now, they both filed separate appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.078" offset="6635708">And it would seem that they both have the right to transcripts on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.661" offset="6650023">And as I say, taking Griffin versus Illinois at its full meaning, it has no meaning, unless you say that the transcript, if a defen -- indigent defendant has the right to a transcript where an opulent, defendant would -- then the same manner, he must have to have the right of counsel because the transcript has no meaning without the use of the counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.799" offset="6766529">I suggest that the holding in the Hynes case which is a federal case that the Sixth Amendments affords to write a counsel that even to determine whether or not a forma pauperis appeal would be available.</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.960" offset="6919189">Now, if you need additional record, he is not going to go any problem -- trouble to move the court for additional record to see the instructions for instance that were given whereas a private counsel would if he were at all conscientious.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.379" offset="7776841">Mr. Chief Justice and the Associate Justices, let me state this as to the Court's question as to whether or not there's a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.423" offset="7825115">I have the occasion to represent Mr. Douglas in two murder trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.069" offset="7843610">One was a hung jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.789" offset="7854477">One was an acquittal in his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.233" offset="7868270">Now, all these witnesses that testified in this robbery trial and these witnesses, they were cross-examined by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.506" offset="7905364">They all testified in those murder trials and they were thoroughly cross-examined Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.733" offset="7930337">And it's even admitted in the transcript, we have before us, by Mr. Carr, the prosecuting attorney that all of these witnesses were thoroughly cross-examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.002" offset="7975372">And I state to this Honorable Court that many of these witnesses were impeached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.047" offset="7999509">Now, Mr. Carr's theory that there was no conflict, Mr. Carr, the prosecutor that is, and he was also the prosecutor in the three murder cases, is that both of the defendants denied participation in any of the robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.698" offset="8066173">Well, they both denied the murder charges, too, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.263" offset="8084459">But yet, they were separate of counsel for each defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.047" offset="8099610">And one received an acquittal and the other one received a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.725" offset="8114239">Now, I say to you, Your Honors that the conflict simply is, that the stigma of Meyes' conviction for murder rubs off on Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.675" offset="8162095">And I know from my own 12 weeks experience in trial that many of the witnesses identified one party but they did not identify the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.535" offset="8205563">Now, he did the same thing in these robbery trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.476" offset="8217266">So perhaps, Douglas might want to find himself in this situation where he de -- denies that he had anything to do with Meyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.676" offset="8250075">I'm not trying to prejudge Meyes' guilt but maybe his testimony is just like it was in the murder cases that -- that he could've -- he had alibi witnesses for example in the murder cases on the date that the robberies were supposed to be committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.579" offset="8309739">Judge Rhone even has this in the transcript as Your Honors have seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.862" offset="8330846">So therefore, if he can produce an alibi witness for example at the robbery trial and Meyes cannot, how can an attorney representing both of these people be arguing and advocate for one of them when he can't do it for the other one?</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.342" offset="8404720">The case is cited here and I believe it's the Matson case and also the Robinson case, state that an attorney must have his mind free and cluttered -- free and uncluttered, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.918" offset="8475042">He must not be worried about being embarrassed when he argues for a second party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.532" offset="8497507">And if he can be embarrassed in his argument, he cannot effectively represent both men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.386" offset="8520913">Now, this is exactly the situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.171" offset="8536064">How can both Meyes and Douglas be effectively represented by the same man when in a -- in a proceeding earlier in two proceedings, one of them has received an acquittal for heinous crime that involved as a motive all these robberies and the other has been convicted?</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.992" offset="8619342">So I submit to Your Honors that this is conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.143" offset="8631986">If I ever seen conflict in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.033" offset="8643480">Now, earlier, Chief Justice Warren, you inquired to Mr. Marks as did some of the other justices about the lack of preparation and I would like to state --</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.448" offset="8913168">I'm asking for continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.058" offset="8923617">Past history proves that no conflict appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.216" offset="8932185">This is what Mr. Carr said, "What has happened since then?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.533" offset="8941484">said Mr. Atkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.910" offset="8947022">“Well, something has happened since then Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.895" offset="8954964">Douglas was acquitted and Bennie Meyes was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.803" offset="8966562">Now, I can defend both of them but I am in a disadvantage in that if I defend both of them, the stigma of the murder conviction as to Bennie Meyes, I have to talk out of one side of my mouth as to Bennie Meyes and out of the other side of my mouth is to Mr. Douglas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.553" offset="9021628">And the court says, "I don't know why."</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.917" offset="9031032">Well, how obvious can anything be?</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.106" offset="9043780">And this is certainly brought up in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.718" offset="9054229">Now, Mr. Atkins goes on as Your Honors can see that he feels Mr. Douglas, he should have an attorney who would represent him and him alone who can make the best use of the fact that an acquittal was earned on his behalf in the murder trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.058" offset="9099577">That is a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.220" offset="9108250">I submit that that this a conflict present in this case which should be obvious to anyone that two lawyers are necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.531" offset="9129462">Then again, on page 67, at the top of the page in the transcript, there is a discussion that is taking place in the impaneling and the Board hearing of the jury that concerns -- again, he really brings up this question of conflict because you can see that there's going to be a conflict again between a prior conviction that Meyes is (Inaudible) going to not have to take the stand and sit mute and Douglas might like to get up and defend himself and you know state that he have nothing to do because he doesn't have to fear being impeached by having a conviction of a prior felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.580" offset="9333739">But he can't -- but they want to see an attorney going to argue for both of the petitioners at the end of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.541" offset="9357563">Why did one get up and testify?</text>

            <text syncTime="2345.485" offset="9485354">One moment, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.891" offset="9534986">Well, the court says the only problem that worried me in all juries when the jurors asked whether or not they would consider the testimony of this one or that one any differently.Jury has not seen or heard any testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.638" offset="9609906">Well, Mr. Atkins talks -- I think the question is perfectly proper because the consideration of a previous conviction by the defendant shouldn't no way influence their determination weighing the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.754" offset="9642402">The point is Mr. Atkins there is where during the juror on previous conviction because he knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.329" offset="9668733">He knows he has to bring it up as to Meyes if he allows Meyes to get up and take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.472" offset="9693288">But he doesn't have to do as to Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.133" offset="9703946">Now, the same attorney representing both men here asking a question like this, about -- would the fact that are -- it was a previous conviction, the previous felony conviction prevents you from -- you know even considering that are giving a just verdict and they, of course, they answered that it wouldn't but either fact that even brings it up because he knows that this is what is going to happen as soon as he starts conducting the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.455" offset="9801226">This stigma which is clearly pointed out to the court because it is a colloquy between Mr. Atkins and the court is going to reverberate against Mr. Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.662" offset="9841977">And Mr. Douglas says, "I don't want to have any of that stigma."</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.997" offset="9851382">He doesn't want to have a lawyer talking about a man who has a felony conviction and at the same time talking about a man who has a clean record, who has an acquittal for -- in the murder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.582" offset="9909687">Now, I say that Mr. Atkins can't properly and with full heart as the Robinson case asked him to do, talk for both of these men at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.314" offset="9956603">Now, that I -- I submit to you as ample evidence of a conflict between these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.314" offset="9996622">Now, going onto the questions that were directed as to the preparation, well, I'm just wondering Your Honors but I don't put these in the form of a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.270" offset="10040404">Your inquiries were directed as to how much time was available for the Public Defender to prepare his case and some 39 or 40 days I think was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.432" offset="10077080">Well, are the defendants to be charged with the lack of preparation by the Public Defender?</text>

            <text syncTime="2535.647" offset="10245935">Now, Judge Rhone have us believe that all the Public Defender wasn't prepared for was the fact that he didn't cross index the earlier transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.986" offset="10291284">Your Honors, I submit to you, this is an untruth because Mr. -- Mr. Atkins has consistently, I'm going to point out to you page-by-page now, stated that he was unqualifiedly unprepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.255" offset="10348440">Now, I refer Your Honors to the following statements by Mr. Atkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.752" offset="10366412">It isn't just a matter of not cross indexing Your Honors and before I point that out, I just want to say that that is no small task.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.898" offset="10394937">There were 12 weeks of murder trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.025" offset="10403506">There were several hundred pages of transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.715" offset="10418239">So that -- that was a considerable job that not had done prior to coming into court that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.824" offset="10438719">Now, first, he says that he is not prepared, on page 29, and he goes on to be more ex -- explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.111" offset="10475813">He says that he hasn't had a time to make a complete investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.558" offset="10501622">That's in the fifth sentence down, the next sentence down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.967" offset="10515205">He says, "For that reason, we have not been able to complete the investigation, contact these people, these robbery witnesses and interrogate them, asking their reasons for remembering dates."</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.618" offset="10557837">Well, he has stated, "This is a lot different than not cross indexing prior transcripts", is it not Your Honors?</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.517" offset="10593468">When a man says “I've not investigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.833" offset="10606738">The Matson case, and I refer you to the petitioner's brief, page 12, the footnote, Matson -- People versus Matson and this is so important where a federal due process requires appointment of counsel, the state court's appointment must be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.695" offset="10682180">It must afford counsel time and opportunity and impose upon him the duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.335" offset="10704750">Now, here's the crux of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.600" offset="10713736">There is a duty on this public defender to be ready for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.787" offset="10734529">Are we going to charge the defendants, Meyes and Douglas with the fact that their counsel wasn't ready just because he had 29 days to prepare?</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.787" offset="10770474">Your Honors, these two men are sitting up on the county jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.069" offset="10783640">They can't walk into the courtroom earlier to make a motion, much is made of the fact that they made a delayed motion on the time actually set for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.848" offset="10814777">I'll point out to the Justices that there was no prior continuance of this case at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.709" offset="10842258">This was a cumulative impact on the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.608" offset="10853752">They realized just as time drew near for trial that their counsel wasn't getting them any attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.073" offset="10875695">That he hadn't come up to see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.061" offset="10883636">He admitted that he says he came up for three hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.552" offset="10893563">They say it was less than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.299" offset="10900564">Three hours, Your Honors, are not enough to prepare a case that involves almost a thousand pages of earlier transcript plus the other investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.879" offset="10942882">So here, the court talks about the Matson case imposed a duty upon this counsel to investigate and prepare for this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.541" offset="10981543">What duty is the court imposed upon him?</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.173" offset="10992097">Now, if he says that he was unprepared and later qualified to say that I could go ahead and try this case but I haven't done certain things, he said much more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.567" offset="11033684">Here's what he said, on page 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.917" offset="11043088">Now, let's turn to page 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.505" offset="11053432">I refer you to renewal for motion for continuance and denial thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.051" offset="11071613">That's drop down to the sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.805" offset="11086555">Since now, in talking to these two defendants, there's a problem arouse only yesterday amongst other problems when I discussed with them the final -- talking to them to prepare to come in to court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.797" offset="11126575">He speaks there about the fact that these problems just arouse the day before the trial which is a very good indication of the fact that he wasn't prepared to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.566" offset="11165654">Now, page 32, now, listen to this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.462" offset="11181223">I never heard a more statement that contradicts itself, on top of page 32, “On my own part I feel that I'm prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.829" offset="11218735">However, I have not been able to state in the transcripts of the previous trials which are voluminous and through the press of all the other businesses that our office handles, I have been handling a case today like every other deputy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.821" offset="11258650">I have not been able to give this the time that I think I should devote to it at present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.172" offset="11284041">So, for that reason, I, myself, feel that would like some more preparation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.361" offset="11300864">Now, you can't equivocate your statements like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.568" offset="11313612">You can't say “I'm prepared, I'm not prepared”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.205" offset="11324165">An attorney is prepared or he is not prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.380" offset="11336913">And it -- again I say, it was the duty of the court to -- to see if this man was ready for trial before he sent these two defendants on the -- have tried the case alone and the record being replete with objections give us a week continuance, give us more continuance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.558" offset="12837595">This is about halfway down, “But not sufficiently in my own mind”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.791" offset="12866539">Page 45, this is perhaps his strongest statement, right at the top of the page, Mr. Atkins starts talking, about three lines down, “It is my opinion that I do not and have not had enough time devoted to this case to adequately prepare me for trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.154" offset="12939995">Now, Your Honors, if two defendants don't have a right at that stage in the proceedings to stand on their constitutional right as annunciated by the Pal case and a hundreds of cases since that time to have effective counsel appointed, prepared counsel appointed and say, “Well, we cannot have this man represent us because he states, he isn't prepared to try this case."</text>

            <text syncTime="3511.121" offset="14147897">Could not the court have granted him one week continuance on his first motion for continuance?</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.040" offset="14171512">Even Douglas stated that he said, “I would go for it if I -- he -- I had a week.</text>

            <text syncTime="3552.890" offset="14314977">Well, what motive would they have for that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.384" offset="14320933">They are in the county jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.949" offset="14331173">It isn't like they're buying a few more days of freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.627" offset="14345906">Douglas wasn't serving anytime at all except he -- after he was acquitted on the murder case, he would have been able to go out to the court, the streets of freeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.229" offset="14388328">Mr. Carr brings up something about being him on probation from a check but that's not true because the court at the end of murder trial said that he already done his time while being in custody for the murder trial as a violation of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.177" offset="14436080">So he was perfectly free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.074" offset="14443708">So there's no reason why Douglas want to continue this case and want to delay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.223" offset="14460217">On the contrary, they want it heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.771" offset="14466487">They just wanted their counsel to be prepared for their case and give their full benefit of their advocacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3680.741" offset="14826350">California has Penal Code 1050 which states the over -- overall philosophy I think of many states that these people of the State of California are all interested in speedy trials and criminal cases and for continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.086" offset="14895731">The Judge will not allow a continuance unless there is affirmative proof of cause and on reasonable notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.161" offset="14924048">Now, we turn to this case where the first notice of the continuance was on the very day of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.348" offset="14948812">And frequently, both counsels can vouch for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.664" offset="14970023">Defense counsel, when they - when they know they're going to hit for a trial unprepared, if they are, and really in good faith, continue it, they can advance the cause on the calendar and so move if that was done in the Kirkwood (ph) case cited by Mr. -- Mr. Marks in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.324" offset="15036688">Now, let's look to the actual preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.415" offset="15045047">Was Atkins himself prepared or did he feel himself prepared?</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.942" offset="15063124">Well, I think this Court can take judicial notice that when counsel is -- desires to put off a case a little bit, he -- he can tend to try to bluff the judge so to speak and -- and advance reasons here and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.012" offset="15123414">And the judge is on the burden, the trial judge of making a decision, well, does he really have good reason for continuance?</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.821" offset="15150686">And it submitted that Judge Rhone did put into this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.423" offset="15169076">And the only reason that is in this record for the desire on the part of Mr. Atkins for continuance was so that he could cross index those prior trail records and preliminary to the instant case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3847.495" offset="15493308">He said that -- in other words, there was an illusion made by Mr. Marks in the record that he felt that he could prepare as he went along the whole trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3864.577" offset="15561644">He could sit there and pull the record of the -- the witnesses testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.741" offset="15578363">And as Your Honors know, trial judges frequently after a witness has testified on direct, allow 5, 10-minute break.</text>

            <text syncTime="3894.038" offset="15679509">Mr. -- getting back to Mr. Atkins' statements, true, he made various equivocal statements about the preparation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4203.516" offset="16917400">Also recall this Mr. Justice Black that the Public Defender's office was not strange to this case because Mr. Brackenridge, defended Meyes throughout the two murder cases on court appointment and he's from the very same office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.919" offset="16971003">Now, let's turn to the murder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.489" offset="16981347">This has been brought up in -- in counsel's briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.198" offset="16992214">And there was much made of these voluminous transcripts of the murder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.608" offset="17017814">The murder case, I handled the appeal from the Attorney General's office on a murder case and at the time of the filing of -- of Mr. Marks' brief, a hearing was still open.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.704" offset="17058147">And Hearing has since been denied in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.076" offset="17067656">There was 3819 page document.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.043" offset="17083538">Now, of that document or of that transcript, 267 pages dealt with these robbery witnesses, evidence of 11 of the 13 counts in the instant case were submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.729" offset="17138291">Now, Mr. Mitchelson has stated there was no reason to cross-exam or there was no reason to really get worked up and find alibis for those particular witnesses at that time, it's only at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.538" offset="17193566">However, Your Honor, the only theory of the prosecution in that murder case of that police officer was that these defendants knew they were being -- they were being sought after for the -- for the -- being sought after for these instant robberies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.641" offset="17261902">And that when the officers knocked on the door of the apartment, the -- the defendants ran into the room, hit out and when the officer walked in, they shot him and killed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.449" offset="17301191">Now, I submit that Mr. Mitchelson would be acknowledging negligence on his part as a practitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.689" offset="17334105">If he didn't hammer out every possible alibi he could for those robberies where that's the sole theory of -- of the prosecution eminent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.190" offset="17372139">And I submit that Mr. Mitchelson did a whale of a job in cross-examining these witnesses, bringing out the fact, their - their bookmakers and their -- their inability to or their perceptive ability to identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.308" offset="17416652">Much the same thing as Mr. Salter did at the preliminary hearing later on the robberies themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.543" offset="17445595">There was every motive to develop every possible thing they could at those murder trials to -- to exploit those robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.143" offset="17467956">They did offer one alibi witness for Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.230" offset="17480286">And Meyes categorically deny involvement and he -- he handled his alibi via his own testimony by stating that he had jobs at those times, his working nights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.583" offset="17517693">That would have conflicted with the possibility of committing those robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.463" offset="17529187">He offered no outside alibi witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.213" offset="17540263">But there was time, there was -- there was ample warning of -- of or ample identification of the type of offenses that might later have been lodged and which were lodged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.394" offset="17580910">And the Public Defender's office, having been in all stages of this case prior to the instant case and being one office, these transcripts were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.885" offset="17618944">And as I say, there was only 267 pages of that 3800 page document that were really material.</text>
            <text syncTime="4386.215" offset="17648201">Now, Mr. Marks in his argument stated -- he argued -- now, the first two trials were murder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.184" offset="17712149">The robberies were really subsidiary to a murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.985" offset="17723329">Mr. Mitchelson expand -- expand on this theme also.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.481" offset="17745272">Now, we're saying this, the murder or the bulk of that 3800 page document is subsidiary to the robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.840" offset="17782784">See, the other side of the coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.751" offset="17790412">And all Mr. Atkins really had to be familiar with was that 267 pages plus a short preliminary transcript and he was ready for trial on the robberies because that's all it was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.188" offset="17840149">Now, Mr. -- Mr. Justice Harlan, I believe, asked Mr. Marks if it was not a fact that -- that these defendants had dismissed the Public Defender, it was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.218" offset="17900231">And that time, Mr. Marks in his -- in his answer to Mr. Justice Harlan said, "All they really wanted was a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.362" offset="17936802">They weren't asking for much a week try to get another -- another counsel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.766" offset="17962402">Right, so the counsel could be prepared was one of the other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.486" offset="17977344">At page 78, Mr. Atkins' last speech at the bottom of that page, “Well, now, suppose that this case were continued until Monday”, recalling this is September 30th, a Wednesday prior to that Monday, “And I had that much time to prepare, would you still desire to have me relieved as your counsel?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.838" offset="18046725">Defendant Meyes, “Yes, Mr. Atkins.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.619" offset="18057801">And he went on to say, "Well, if he can have his own counsel, he'd be satisfied."</text>

            <text syncTime="5152.660" offset="20714036">Now, on -- on relation to that motion, Mr. -- Mr. Marks stated that apparently, this is some reflection on his -- on -- on Atkins' preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.919" offset="20763042">Well, first of all, I answered your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.235" offset="20772342">I don't think that the evidence that they wanted to exercise a preparatory challenge in and off itself supports any legal reason that, any legal reasoning so to speak or -- or law that -- that Judge Rhone was -- was unfair with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.805" offset="20842559">I really don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.597" offset="20845798">They -- in other words, they knew Rhone advanced through the -- the first mistrial murder case with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.123" offset="20867845">And they -- they had reason, apparently, from that that they wanted to dismiss him on the other hand after -- once they have -- understand this that 170.6 is a preparatory challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5202.375" offset="20912880">You can do that, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.727" offset="20922284">You don't have to have any cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.526" offset="20929494">170 in California Penal Code is still in effect for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.405" offset="20949034">You can dismiss the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.759" offset="20954363">Anytime you -- you can show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.903" offset="20963035">Now, apparently, there was no great discrepancy between this man and Judge Rhone or they or having laws on 170.6.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.635" offset="20989889">Mr. Atkins would have turned around and try the 170 and -- and spell out to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.113" offset="21007862">The difference that to me is in 170.6, you don't have to allege any reason at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.947" offset="21023117">You can just orally state, “I -- I don't want you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.107" offset="21035760">On the other hand, on 170, you have to tell a court why you don't want him to sit, why you think he is prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="5251.744" offset="21110366">And there had been three continuances before and then he corrects himself, three motions for continuance before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.044" offset="21131577">I can adhere these matters piecemeal, a motion is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.792" offset="21142549">In other words, at this time, Atkins came back with a suggestion that he had Leo Brennan and -- and that -- that morning already Judge Rhone, who by this time was probably getting a little hurried, had heard three other mixed motions for continuance on various grounds including Douglas' mother illness and -- and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.916" offset="21223006">He meant that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.915" offset="21227081">There'd been three motions for continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.923" offset="21235022">There had not been any continuances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5285.802" offset="21246621">Now, I think, unless Your Honors have other questions on the preparation point, I might turn to the conflicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5293.069" offset="21275669">As a spearhead for this, Mr. Marks stated that some evidence of Atkins' lack of preparation was the fact that he should -- he undoubtedly knew or should have known that five days prior to the day of trial, you had the file list preparatory challenge under 170.6 or it wasn't timely and which was so held in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.101" offset="21367724">Therefore, if Mr. Atkins knew that, he also knew that the highest court in our State, State Supreme Court, has held that where two defendants desire to -- whe -- where defendant desires to dismiss the judge under 170.6 where a codefendant has dismissed the judge under 170.6, the code -- the -- the defendant then desiring to exercise, it much show a conflict of interest or an adverse interest to the one exercising it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.772" offset="21482454">What I'm saying is this, that in -- in California, as I've submitted in the other state, there are numerous judges that either defendants or plaintiffs or -- or both don't particularly desire to have their case heard in front of or the feeling they're summoned to prejudice of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.358" offset="21552776">Mr. Atkins had available here, two challenges, if there was a conflict of interest between Meyes and Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.157" offset="21575973">He could have had Meyes execute this -- this one and then save the other one in case he got into some other judges' court he didn't like then Douglas could have done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.735" offset="21606275">He would have had two shots, he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.741" offset="21614320">They filed a joint affidavit of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.304" offset="21624560">And I submit that -- that this launches us into a discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.746" offset="21638353">I'm not saying that's a lot of evidence at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5385.553" offset="21645563">I'm just saying that utilizing Mr. Marks' argument about that 170.6.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.397" offset="21664998">It is a good focal point to turn into the actual conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.028" offset="21679522">Now, assuming this Court desires to impose the rule of -- the federal rule of Glasser upon the States, they will -- they can do so through the Fourteenth Amendment and hold at any given set of facts, the denial of separate counsel and analogizing to the Betts-Brady type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.138" offset="21759875">In a given situation if the facts are there, denial of separate counsel where there's a conflict of interest might be a denial of due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="5512.195" offset="22152129">There were, in other words, witnesses that would -- would have testimony that wouldn't affect Glasser but would affect Kretske, in other words, a substantial trial tactical conflict between the interest of Kretske and Glasser.</text>
            <text syncTime="5527.819" offset="22214614">Let's turn to our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.715" offset="22222242">Mr. Atkins made only one real statement and that all he did was bring up the murder trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.524" offset="22249514">He said, “What has happened since then after Mr. Carr asking to show what the conflict is?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.556" offset="22269576">Recalling that Mr. Carr had told the judge, “Our evidence will be related to the -- relating to the 13 counts that these men both rob so and so, both rob so and so, both the solid so and so (Inaudible).”</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.462" offset="22325269">And then later, he said -- he said, “As to the robbery transactions, I enumerate in the court, that evidence was introduced on both of these homicide matters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.614" offset="22361840">The defendants testified concerning those robberies and their testimony made a general and categorical denial as any participation of those robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.504" offset="22389426">They didn't try to throw the blame on the commission of the robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.097" offset="22403741">Douglas didn't attempt to throw it on Meyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.893" offset="22410951">Meyes didn't attempt to throw it on Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5578.381" offset="22416906">They got up, offered independent alibis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.213" offset="22428191">Douglas offered one -- one witness only as to one of the dates and otherwise just categorically denied and Meyes did likewise offering no other witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5590.555" offset="22465599">Now, that is all the showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.651" offset="22473958">He just says, “Now, I can defend -- what has happen since?</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.268" offset="22492453">Well, something has happened since then, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.941" offset="22499140">Douglas was acquitted and Bennie Meyes was convicted of this murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5602.405" offset="22513037">And that's all really, subs -- substantively that he -- he brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.685" offset="22530069">Now, go -- going back to what Mr. Marks stated, he -- he has stated that in -- in talking about another point that the -- the robberies were subsidiary to the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.532" offset="22577507">And we say here, this murder is subsidiary to the robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.805" offset="22590568">Those men were tried on a murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.396" offset="22596942">One was acquitted and one was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.171" offset="22604048">But getting -- staying away from the prior record aspects, first, going right to the actual trial conflict, the tactical trial conflict, there was non-showing from that as in Glasser.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.951" offset="22651173">I submit that, there -- there was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="5639.232" offset="22660263">The only conflict, and I'll turn to that in a minute, that Mr. Mitchelson raises it all is the -- is the fact that these two men were -- had to go to trial and one had some -- one had three priors and one had an allegedly clean record.</text>

            <text syncTime="6086.360" offset="24448815">I'll try -- I'd like to try and close and leave Mr. James some time on this right to counsel on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6092.150" offset="24472012">And I'll close with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6093.782" offset="24478490">The only other -- the only other point brought out it -- that might -- we -- we might examine as a possible conflict is what about this, where a man is put to trial with another man and they both have priors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.067" offset="24539617">I submit that there are many, many types of people that are put to trial together and -- and may have one counsel, may have two counsels.</text>
            <text syncTime="6117.206" offset="24572217">They probably just didn't even want to be -- be in trial with that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.392" offset="24584965">In other words, the fact that a man has priors alone is enough reason to say not to want on your own prior as a defendant to be tried with him because even if he's got separate counsel, there's a chance that that might rub off or if he stays up the stand, the jury is going to draw a bad anyway any way against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6137.684" offset="24654137">And I don't think that -- that this in and off itself either as a matter of due process or as a matter of substantive law is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.601" offset="24681827">Now, I will say this that this record shows adequately that the trial judge, Mr. Atkins, too, before he was dismissed and the prosecutor drove home to the jury and on the basis that Mr. Atkins undoubtedly intended to place Mr. Meyes on the stand, drove home the effect that this jury should pay those prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6171.708" offset="24790183">I have reference to page 65 by Mr. Atkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.833" offset="24814738">No excuse me, page 65, Mr. Atkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.976" offset="24847235">He stated if it came to your knowledge that one of these defendants had been convicted of a very serious felony in the past, first, I will ask you that part.</text>
            <text syncTime="6194.125" offset="24879835">First, would you be able to keep that felony conviction separate and apart from the other defendant in the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="6199.241" offset="24900315">Again, I'm going to go down the line on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6201.193" offset="24908152">By that question, I mean I am just asking you if you think you would be capable of not letting that conviction taint the other person in anyway, in other words, the “birds of a feather attitude”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6210.419" offset="24945037">The judge inter -- interrupting at this point said, “Well, before you do that, I think that those who have not set on a jury case before should understand that a witness maybe asked if he has ever been convicted of a felony and it can be -- that can be asked only in one basis and that is for the possible impeachment of him as a witness and that could be the only basis it can be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="6228.621" offset="25017866">It cannot be considered for any other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="6231.263" offset="25028420">All 12 jurors answering they could keep that fact of mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6234.627" offset="25041899">And it might be added that it's -- it's a standard ins -- instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6239.345" offset="25060707">And if Mr. Meyes had actually taken the stand in this trial and had not -- never denied his prior as if he did not or if he had never admitted his priors, if he admits his priors, they won't be brought up again except on the impeachment basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.626" offset="25113893">But if he took the stand and they came up on that basis then the -- the judge would have instructed the jury later that evidence has been received of other crimes and he had told them exactly what they were supposed to consider it for.</text>
            <text syncTime="6268.695" offset="25178154">And we can only assume and hope that jurors follow those instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6272.900" offset="25194977">And with that, I'll turn the argument over to Mr. James.</text>

            <text syncTime="6282.553" offset="25233533">Honorable Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, I will devote what is left of the argument to point number two which has been advanced by these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="6292.967" offset="25275225">Mr. Goertzon has covered the aspect of due process and the claim of denial thereof at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6299.466" offset="25301243">These petitioners also complained that they were denied due process and equal protection on the appeal because the appellate court did not appoint counsel to them and therefore, they were discriminated because of their poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6314.960" offset="25363205">We, of course, submit that there is no basis in fact or substance to this claim and that these defendants as are all indigent defendants in the State of California are accorded a full effective appellate review, required both by the State Constitution and the provisions of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6336.098" offset="25447737">Now, the claim in this regard is presented in two aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="6340.305" offset="25464560">The first aspect is the claim that one of these petitioners did not get himself an individual copy of the reporter's transcript and the clerk's transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="6350.122" offset="25503848">And therefore, he was denied some right to present anything to an appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6356.012" offset="25527463">And 1the second aspect is that both of these petitioners were denied appointment of counsel by an appellate court and therefore, because of their indigency, they were denied a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6368.037" offset="25575528">Well, inherent and implicit in this particular attack upon the judgments of the California court is the claim that California's appellate procedure, as it relates to defendants both indigent and those who are wealthy, is discriminatory because of the particular financials status of the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6389.570" offset="25661628">And as we will point out in the time remaining, the entire appeal procedure in the States was thoroughly in accordance with state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6399.139" offset="25699976">And it is only be by holding that the rules of appeal in the State of California and the provisions of the Penal Code of that State are a denial to indigent defendants of equal protection that we can strike down these particular judgments on the basis of this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="6416.798" offset="25770611">First, we should perhaps examine just what happens in California when an appeal is taken by the -- by a defendant in a criminal case from a judgment of conviction in the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6429.646" offset="25821915">In California, a -- an appeal is instituted by filing a written notice of appeal within 10 days after the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken with the clerk to the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6441.733" offset="25870294">There's no fee required for the filing of this notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6444.767" offset="25882415">It can be a handwritten document as where the documents in this particular case, delivered to the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.870" offset="25906866">California, in aid of indigent defendants, while the rule is generally that this 10-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional has held that where an indigent is in prison and because of the mailing conditions of the prison is unable to timely file his notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6468.994" offset="25979382">It will be presumed that there was a constructive filing and he is allowed his appeal regardless of the timeliness of the filing of the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6477.115" offset="26011878">Now, this institutes the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6480.118" offset="26023894">And certainly, this is not a denial to an indigent defendant of any right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6484.782" offset="26042493">Now, when the appeal is instituted, there is prepared, as a matter of course, what is denominated a normal record on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6492.448" offset="26073213">And these consist of the clerk's transcript, consisting of the pleadings, the motions, the clerk's minutes, the judgment and the notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6501.097" offset="26107800">In addition, there is a reporter's transcript which is prepared at county expense, not at the expense of the particular appealing party but prepare at the expense of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="6513.709" offset="26158164">This contains the oral proceedings on the taking of evidence, objections made and the rulings of the court on the objections to introduction of evidence and it also contains the oral proceedings taking at the motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6528.566" offset="26217618">In addition, the appellant may request that if he shows good cause for an additional or augmented record and this was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6538.003" offset="26255339">These particular petitioners requested an augmented record and their request was honored and granted and the court made an order granting these defendants more than the normal record on appeal so that they could have an effective appellate review of the proceedings that took place in the trial court and it --</text>
