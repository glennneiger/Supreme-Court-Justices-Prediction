            <text syncTime="541.424" offset="2269080">And the panel that decided the case on the merits was unaware that this attempt had been made, it seemed very apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.514" offset="2297396">So, that the petition for rehearing was filed with the Court to point out that these affidavits had been filed and that there -- that the petitioner had attempted to excuse the failure to appeal since that was the basis of the Court's opinion that -- we're trying to bring it to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.063" offset="2399587">And on -- on the basis of the petition for rehearing, the Court vacated their initial decision and on their motion set the case down for rehearing en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.720" offset="2442219">Now the question that they -- that they sought the counsel to discuss, the rehearing en banc was a limited one.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.291" offset="2552560">“The question is whether the appellant, either in the affidavits filed in this Court or otherwise, has made such a showing as to entitle him to a hearing in the District Court on the question of whether notwithstanding his failure to appeal directly from the judgment of conviction, he is entitled to a hearing in the District Court, on the right he claims to attack collaterally under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255, the validity of the judgment of conviction on the basis of the admission and evidence of an alleged coerced confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.253" offset="2700413">Now on the basis of that question and after rehearing, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court again with three judges dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.922" offset="2747016">The holding of the majority in that Court I believe is important because I think it does define with precision, the specific issue which should be here under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.723" offset="2790275">The majority ruled that Section 2255 is simply not available to challenge an unappealed conviction based upon a coerced confession regardless of the reasons for failing to appeal whether excusable or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.578" offset="2869687">The majority assumed again without deciding that the petitioner's confession was coerced and that his failure to file a timely appeal was excusable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.037" offset="4919568">Our position is that it -- well actually, there are -- there's a broad position and a narrower position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.374" offset="4944854">One is that where this claim of a basic right has at -- the conviction is based upon the denial of a basic right is made that absent some of the fact that is frivolous, that he is entitled to a hearing on that claim because that's what sub -- that's what the purpose of collateral remedies are, and this is regardless of whether there's an appeal or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.157" offset="5040044">This is the same as it would be in -- in many other areas that might be claimed where -- which could have been raised on appeal, but were not raised on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.004" offset="5075362">But later, the Courts have held the collateral attack was -- was available because it was necessary to do substantial justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.928" offset="5107127">Now, I -- I would say that in this case, if the -- if the Court is going to limit the availability of the writ, that certainly they shouldn't limit it where in -- for all practical purposes, there was no opportunity for a person to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.145" offset="5199914">Now, we get back to the merits of his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.137" offset="5215901">Now, it seems to me what the Government seems to argue is that -- well, in some cases, there is -- it's very clear that it's a coerced confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.455" offset="5253204">And in those cases, surely, we would give collateral -- we would allow collateral remedy and then there are other cases which well, there's just a little maybe a coercion maybe or it's not as clear, but I'm saying, unless it's absolutely frivolous, he's entitled to a judicial determination of whether or not this claim -- his claim that this confession was coerced is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.135" offset="5343901">It's only a judicial determination of this basic constitutional issue that will -- will offer him any protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.819" offset="5418611">And to me, it makes all the difference in the world between sayings where there was a constitutional claim, duly canvassed at trial, appropriately considered or pursued perhaps erroneously considered for which the remedy is appeal, automatic right as appeal and that automatic right of appeal has been foregone not because of any unfairness in -- to the defendant that the appeal wasn't taking because it wasn't taken with eyes wide open whether in such a situation, you may then go over the same ground instead of an appeal in -- under 2255.</text>

            <text syncTime="1434.212" offset="5840227">Well, I think that -- I think that no different rule should apply here than applies when a District Court under 2254 considers the claim that a -- a confession was coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.896" offset="5886934">And there, this Court has held that the review of the trial transcript absent any other unusual showing would probably be sufficient for the Court to make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.059" offset="5935626">Actually in this case, the Court -- the case was presented on the basis of the trial transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.742" offset="5962376">And so, I would think it's discretionary with the District Court Judge at the time of the hearing as to whether or not to allow additional evidence if there's some proper of additional evidence which he feels maybe appropriate to the decide the question which is the important one of whether this confession is coerced or not, then I will assume that it's within his discretion to allow additional evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.327" offset="6052655">In this case, no addition, we're not relying on additional evidence although we don't know whether it was proper at the 2255 hearing since the transcript of that hearing is -- is not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.453" offset="6109184">And our position really is that, in meeting the Government's, we haven't briefed or -- or -- or we weren't prepared to argue the question of whether or not this trial transcript does show a coerced confession because that question, we haven't thought, was decided by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.565" offset="6177625">The Court of Appeals had decided only that he's not entitled to have that question decided in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.637" offset="6201971">And we think that the trial transcript does clearly show that this confession was involuntary as the matter of law and that the circumstances surrounding the obtaining of this confession are far more compelling than many of the cases which this Court has decided where they have held that a confession was coerced and a conviction should be set aside because it was based upon that coerced confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.540" offset="6301550">We don't feel at that -- that question, we don't feel has been passed upon by the Court of Appeals, the merits of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.494" offset="6333315">In our -- in our view, the -- the Court of Appeals has merely held that he is not entitled to have this question heard collaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.551" offset="6381589">And we say that this is a stringent rule that -- and I would like get into what we consider the -- the -- the balances which are involved here and which the Court relied upon as opposed to what we would say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.008" offset="6451388">That the important thing, it seems to me, that the majority and the dissent below both seem to in our view agree upon the issue that where there is no direct appeal but a later collateral attack based upon a coerced confession introduced into evidence and even though there's good reason for failure to appeal, the majority says that the availability of the remedy should be denied and the minority said that its certainly should be granted in that -- in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.855" offset="6578761">And this is an issue, if we can agree upon the issue, that has never been passed upon by this Court and we think that it is a -- that it is -- this issue is in sharp focus here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.676" offset="6638111">Of course, there's no point in going in to the -- the fact that this -- the Court's decision was regard to coerced confession and their effect upon basic constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.268" offset="6680430">This has been held time and time again by this Court to be fundamentally -- render the proceedings fundamentally unfair and of mere pretense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.194" offset="6728182">But in order to focus upon the -- this concept of the affect of a coerced confession on a trial, in relation to the availability of collateral remedies, I'd like to discuss very briefly four decisions of this Court which I believe was in the context of these decisions, this case must be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.154" offset="6808012">First is in 1939, the Bowen v. Johnson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.883" offset="6822954">In that case, the Court was determining the scope of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.913" offset="6846986">The -- the Court made this -- the distinctions there between the availability of the writ for -- to review constitutional errors or -- and mere errors of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.527" offset="6897455">Actually, in that case, it was a technical jurisdictional question which -- and there had been no appeal from the conviction and the question was whether the United States had jurisdiction over certain park lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.052" offset="6959626">The Court, in that case, held that due to the exceptional circumstances, even though there hadn't been an appeal from the conviction that they would allow him to collaterally attack the conviction on the basis of this technical jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.615" offset="7033814">The Court did then undertake to resolve the issue which the petitioner had claimed all though he -- they resolved it against him, but it was an -- a legal issue that was presented there which the Court did permit the person to -- to raise collaterally even though he had not filed a direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.751" offset="7130363">And again in Sunal v. Large in 1947, the Court was concerned specifically with the failure to appeal on the right of collateral attack of a conviction and there again, the Court distinguished between error -- an error depriving a person of a constitutional right and a mere error of law, saying that, “That the writ is not designed for collateral review of errors of law committed in a trial court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.355" offset="7248750">In that case, there had been no appeal from the conviction, but the court had determined that the -- that the defendant deliberately chose not to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.480" offset="7301308">And also, that Court determined that the error that was being charged was not a constitutional proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.969" offset="7331297">And for these reasons, the Court denied the right to collateral attack, but the Court also, in dictum, pointed out illustrative instances where the failure to appeal would not bar collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.611" offset="7385840">And, one of these was specifically mentioned where the trial or sentence by a federal court violated specific constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.426" offset="7429099">It seems apparent from the reasoning of the Court in Sunal that the remedy of habeas corpus would have been available in that case if the claimed error had been a constitutional proportion despite the failure and in despite that the volunteer -- the deliberate choice that he had failed to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.026" offset="7515512">Now since the Sunal case, this thinking of the Court has become crystallized in the case of Jordan against the United States which was decided by this Court in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.474" offset="7577266">Now, we have relied strongly on Jordan and the Court of Appeals and we rely heavily upon the Jordan decision in this Court because we think that the Jordan case and the Jordan decision is absolutely controlling of the issue that's before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.503" offset="7637347">I'd like to run through that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.005" offset="7643408">There, the petitioner had been convicted of an attempted robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.064" offset="7663679">An appeal was taken from the conviction, but it did not raise the point that he had been deprived of a speedy trial in violation of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.258" offset="7716446">The -- on appeal, the -- the conviction was affirmed, and certiorari was not sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.837" offset="7746748">Subsequently, he filed a motion under Section 2255 claiming that his constitutional right had -- to a speedy trial had been denied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.535" offset="7801501">The Court of Appeals, it seems to us, consistent with their decision in this Hodges case, ruled that this contention of lack of a speedy trial could not be raised on a 2255 motion, since it could have been but was not raised on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.562" offset="7881644">And certiorari was sought on this precise issue, namely whether a prisoner is entitled to a 2255 hearing, solely on the ground that his conviction was constitutionally invalid because he had been denied a speedy trial despite the fact that he could have, but did not raise the point on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.315" offset="7988642">On the petition for certiorari, the Government argued that this was the type of claim that could only be raised on appeal and that there was not a type of error which could be made the basis for collateral attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.252" offset="8160423">The Court, anyway, rejected this argument of the Government and reversed the Court of Appeals per curiam, sent it back to the case -- sent the case back for determination on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.090" offset="8207757">It seems to us in the essentials that these two cases, the Hodges and the Jordan cases are similar and I'll get back to your distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.936" offset="8251120">Both petitioners claimed that their convictions were based upon a denial of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.376" offset="8272854">The errors claimed, by both, were correctible on appeal that neither petitioner raised the point on appeal, but both later sought a hearing under Section 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.647" offset="8330010">The Court ruled that Jordan was entitled to a hearing, but in the Hodges case, the Court of Appeals ruled that Hodges was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.241" offset="8384345">Now, it seems to us, actually, that there's -- that the Hodges -- and the Hodges case has a far more compelling reason than the -- in the Jordan case because the -- in Jordan, he offered no reason for his failure to raise his constitutional objection on appeal, whereas in Hodges, he has a reason which for all practical -- from every practical standpoint means that he was denied the opportunity or he had no opportunity to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.421" offset="8517047">It's interesting to -- to note that in the Jordan -- that the Government before the Court of Appeals despite our heavy reliance upon this did not mention the Jordan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.597" offset="8565739">The Court of Appeals also did not mention it in their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.953" offset="8591235">In the present brief, the Government for the first time makes the mention of the Jordan case on page 52 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.257" offset="8624358">And there, they treat it by simply brushing it aside with the contention that the claim in that case, lack of a speedy trial, “Could be deemed to vitiate the entire trial, and in that sense was truly jurisdictional.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.740" offset="8690291">It seems to us that by this language, the Court appears to be attempting to make a distinction between the seriousness of the constitutional right claimed that have been denied in Jordan and the constitutional right claimed that have been denied in Hodges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.672" offset="8750059">The implication is that while lack of a speedy trial vitiates the trial, the use of a coerced confession does not, but this is completely inconsistent of course with this Court's many pronouncements to the effect that the use of a coerced confession in a trial would -- is sufficient to void the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="5074.412" offset="20400985">I think -- and therefore, it is our view that you simply don't have to reach it because that on this record, there is a very clear and almost uncontrovertible ground that is that it is not -- there are no decisions that I know of which hold that if an issue was a question of fact for the jury that that issue can be canvassed on 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.633" offset="20521880">Now, the other question, assuming it was here that whether the judge made a mistake as the matter of law in allowing confession to go into evidence and then allowing it to be submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.652" offset="20585932">This, we think, is a different question and while we agree with the Court of Appeals, we realize that this involves a much more difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.195" offset="20624175">This Court has held with respect to state cases that even though a defendant has appealed his conviction and has sought certiorari in this Court, the issue of whether a state has used a coerced confession -- confession is cognizable by motion, by habeas corpus in the state court and I take it that this is a largely the basis of petitioner's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.950" offset="20759176">He is saying, what you held about state trials ought to carryover to the federal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.883" offset="20790941">We think it clearly should not do so in the situation where there has been an appeal or there has been a very conscious election not to appeal because the situations, as I say in federal cases, are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="5192.478" offset="20873279">The leading case that established the right to attack a state court conviction through habeas corpus is the case of Brown against Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.029" offset="20927509">And in that case, this Court in a sense articulated its reason for allowing that matter to be brought up in a federal habeas corpus proceedings in the District Court even though it has been reviewed by the Highest Court of the State and as I -- we understand that case, the reason was this, since 1867, when Congress in the Habeas Corpus Act provided that the writ of habeas corpus extends to a prisoner in state custody in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the federal court has its duty to make sure that a state conviction has not been in violation of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.083" offset="21127711">Now, on direct review, the only court that can carry out that duty would be this Court and the volume and the difficulties set forth in Brown against Allen were (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.788" offset="21178493">It was felt for this reason that the matter should be deemed subject to review in a federal court -- the Federal District Court subject to review by a Federal Court of Appeals and then ultimately before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5286.154" offset="21247979">But of course, that doesn't apply in a federal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5376.687" offset="21610141">Now, this Court has said with regard to confessions that while it's bound by the findings of fact by the trier of fact, what actually happened, the interpretation of the facts are whether as a -- whether those admitted facts amount to coercion as the matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5399.754" offset="21702405">This Court has said as a fact, “A federal court isn't bound by the state court's findings and presumably, an appellate court is not bound by the District Court's finding” and that's where, I think, the debatable area comes in generally, not this case, but generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="5428.317" offset="21816613">It seems to me in the normal case where defendant has taken an appeal or where he could have taken an appeal and consciously elected not to do so, even if he's now claiming that the District Court erred in the interpretation of the fact, that this is a matter which he should have urged on appeal and that it should not be re-litigated before the same court, and again subject to the same standards just saying, “Well maybe, you'll might have changed your mind,” where we get into a few more difficult areas unquestionably is if we could be said that District Court made a mistake in its interpretation of the fact and I didn't appeal, but my appeal was based on excusable neglect.</text>
