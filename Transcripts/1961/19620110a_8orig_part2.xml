            <text syncTime="1482.409" offset="6033011">But until the building of Boulder Dam, virtually all of those projects where occurs first by flood and then by drought.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.768" offset="6854405">Arizona was afraid that California would develop first therefore, she wanted to be protected before she would vote in the support of this project.</text>

            <text syncTime="1768.392" offset="7176965">In the first place that the water actually being put to use in 1928 and this is a rough estimate but it shows the proper order of magnitude, was only 3.2 million but what she talks about today as existing project it's not water that is being used today, the water that California hopes to use through those projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.528" offset="7281455">The Metropolitan Water District in 1928 was a gleam in somebody's eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.553" offset="7305592">They've spent some money on engineering.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.777" offset="7410500">Under these circumstances, I think it's unnecessary to argue that the United States had the constitutional power to allocate the waters impounded and controlled by this federal works.</text>

            <text syncTime="2632.296" offset="10632547">Well, of course they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.156" offset="10639966">I don't dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.749" offset="10650415">I don't think the Master really disputes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.985" offset="10667342">The Master as I understand it was saying essentially this, “Congress are questionably referred to Article III (a) of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.225" offset="10720319">It did this supposing that Article III (a) apportion to the Lower Basin 7,500,000 acre-feet out of all the waters in the mainstream.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.003" offset="10791372">The Congress may have been wrong in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.815" offset="10798582">He, in fact -- the Master goes on and says, “The Congress was wrong in that, that the true meaning of the Compact is that Article III (a) apportions a universe or apportion 7,500,000 out of the universe of all the waters in the Lower Basin including the Gila.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.217" offset="10876217">But Congress was wrong” so the Master says, but that was the last Congress put a meaning which is quite clear from the legislative history and for the words of the Project Act on the Compact and we must did interpreting the Project Act, give effect to what Congress thought it meant rather than what we now in our after the event wisdom may concluded that it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.835" offset="10990738">And I think what can put the issue fairly so sickly by saying that the question is whether Section 4 (a) of the Project Act to these critical words should be read to incorporate the meaning of the Compact had which Congress suppose it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.215" offset="11092198">Now, as a matter of fact -- which is had -- I mean which suppose the Compact had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.799" offset="11118529">As the matter of fact, Arizona read -- argues that Congress's assumption as the meaning of the Compact was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.056" offset="11151548">And if you were to delve into that, I think you would conclude that there was a good deal to be said for that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.310" offset="11184567">If Arizona is right in its meaning about Compact, then there is now a departure from the literal meeting of the Section 4 (a) of Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.354" offset="11236812">There's now departure from the proper meaning of the Compact and therefore knowing consistency in the words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.993" offset="11271293">If the Master is right in saying, "Oh, that's not the meaning of the Compact" then of course we are not putting a literal interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.685" offset="11314134">Compact and we are not giving the quite of reference, the meaning which it truly has but rather the meaning which Congress opposed it to have.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2841.006" offset="11467421">And I take it, we therefore go to the point of saying that we are willing to have the Project Act construed on the assumption that Arizona is wrong and California is right about the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.008" offset="11519352">Really what I'm trying to suggest and all I'm trying to suggest is that the meaning of the Compact was not beyond debate and that therefore, there is nothing very cruel or -- about saying, “We're going to give it the meaning that Congress thought it had” and -- rather under that what we know -- think is the actual meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.643" offset="11633977">Now, I would like to turn to the implications both in the statute and in the legislative history, which indicate that Congress refer to the Compact supposing that if apportioned that, therefore as way of apportioning but I call loosely the mainstream water, the mainstream and the waters in the upper tributaries above Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.080" offset="11743692">I found the first indication of that in the Project Act itself as the Master said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.686" offset="11770128">It seems to me that there are three -- well, it seems to me that once you doubt first that no one spouses here a completely literal meaning of all the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.635" offset="11829896">For example, California while it contents for a literal meaning of the Compact and a literal reading of the words 4,400,000 acre-feet of the waters apportioned to the Lower Basin States by Article -- by paragraph A of Article III of the Compact says, “We should read those literally and should read the Compact literally.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.408" offset="11928952">When it comes to the phrase not more than one half of any excess or surplus waters unapportioned by a said compact, it doesn't want to read the Compact literally because the only time that unapportioned by the Compact comes in to the Compact is it one of the closing articles where it says it preserves those waters for later apportionment after 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.839" offset="12038771">At the 3b water cannot be called, we think water unapportioned by the Compact if one is govern by the literal work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.349" offset="12084746">Now, Arizona is not willing to have a literal meaning put on the Compact and have it been literally incorporated into the Project Act neither as the Master and neither as we, and neither are we.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.282" offset="12144515">So that all of us agreed that what cannot resolve is by an absolutely literal meaning that some construction is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.396" offset="12200939">And I don't think anyone advances the case where I thought by saying, "Oh well, you are trying to go behind the words, what has to go behind the words?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.219" offset="12236257">Now, the second thing which I would emphasize about the Project Act itself is that the second paragraph of Section 4 contains three strong indications that the Master is correct in his reading of the first paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.916" offset="12323088">Subdivision 1 of the second paragraph, “The states of Arizona, California, and Nevada are authorized to enter into an agreement which shall provide water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.280" offset="12376482">That those 7,500,000 acre-feet, annually apportioned to the Lower Basin by paragraph A of Article III of the Colorado River Compact.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.494" offset="12425383">Now, there you see, Congress indicated quite plainly that it sought that paragraph A of Article III of the Colorado River Compact was at apportionment of 7,500,000 acre-feet, which was not present -- or which is not mentioned in the first paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.238" offset="12512319">And the two paragraphs are quite plainly belong together as opposite have of the same apple or opposite has at the torn piece paper and indeed if the edges on one piece of paper have been sculpt and rumpled and obliterated, I think you could find the meaning, find their true shape by lucky get the other half of seeing how they fit together because this obviously were meant to fit together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.358" offset="12628825">The second indication that is important is that enclosed to, the second paragraph of Section 4 (a) says that the State of Arizona may annually use one-half of the excess or surplus waters of apportion by the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.060" offset="12719626">Well now, currently says given the half to California, half to Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.647" offset="12749928">If Congress has in mind all the waters in the Lower Basin, it's authorized these three states to take all of them, excluding the New Mexico, Utah and gives that nothing at all which is something which would seem most extra ordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.892" offset="12854941">Furthermore, if that were the meaning, Congress is undertaking to divide between these two states without qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.234" offset="12900289">The water had switched the Compact it selves speaks off as subject to further apportion that measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.011" offset="12931427">On the other hand, if you read the whole thing on the Colorado River water excluding the Gila then this speaks in terms of the States that had accessed to the river water and of course leaves the tributaries out and the rights of New Mexico and Utah are not impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.697" offset="13010108">Third, the third subdivision that the State of Arizona shall have the exclusive beneficial consumptive use of the Gila River and its tributaries within the boundaries of said States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.627" offset="13069876">It seems to me that nothing further is required to be said to show that this obviously gives the Gila to Arizona in addition to the waters apportioned as 7,500,000 acre-feet, add one half of the excess or surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.367" offset="13152841">Now, California says that they have seen this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.959" offset="13163186">Well, this is just a specification that Arizona is to be able to take her share out of the Gila that out of Arizona's 2,800,000 apportioned by the earlier subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.052" offset="13227551">She used to have the right to take it out of the Gila.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.883" offset="13242911">But what they normally looked back to say that there was no need to make any declaration to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.544" offset="13269556">California can't take water out of the Gila and Nevada certainly can't take water out of the Gila.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.688" offset="13294111">Furthermore, as you read this second paragraph through, I think it will become quite clear that each of this is an addition to the previous subdivision that there should be this one addition which is a sub-specification of the meaning of an earlier subdivision, just as not in keeping with the general scheme of gratitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.489" offset="13401318">California has a broader argument as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.791" offset="13418559">She says in her brief, I think I'm stating it accurately that well paragraphs one and paragraph two of Section 4 (a) were alternatives, it was never thought that they would both take effect at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.360" offset="13480835">The paragraph 2 contemplates tri-state compact, if you've got the tri-state compact, there would be no problem about getting ratification of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.880" offset="13526915">And therefore, there would be no reason for the Limitation Act ever to come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.546" offset="13553560">I think that there are several complete answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.381" offset="13580936">The first one is that the first paragraph of Section 4 (a) requires ratification of the Compact within six months and says that the California must adopt their Limitation Act unless the Compact is ratified within six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.933" offset="13663065">There is no such time limitation of the second paragraph of Section 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.660" offset="13690023">In other words, if six months runs, California must enact its Limitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.159" offset="13723982">There still would be an opportunity for a tri-state compact under the second paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.319" offset="13748642">Now, there's an indication in Section 8 (b) which I think makes it fairly clear that the Congress did visualize that the tri-state compact might be negotiated after the Project Act had taken in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.534" offset="13829517">And that would mean had almost surely had taken effect pursuant to California's adopting a Limitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.198" offset="13860133">Section 8 (b) contains further instructions about the way the United States is to manage the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.196" offset="13900152">And it instructs the United States down at the very bottom of the page, the last word of the third from the last line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.873" offset="13926902">Shall observe and be subject to and control anything contrary not withstanding, by the terms of such compact if any between the States of Arizona, California and Nevada, skipping some words which may be negotiated and approved by said States and to which congress shall give its consent on approval on or before January 1, 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.000" offset="14039333">And the terms of any such compact concluded between said States and approved and consented to by the Congress after said date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.196" offset="14080188">So, in that Section talking about something that would happen after January 1, 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.793" offset="14106520">And then it says, provided that to the latter case, such compact shall be subject to all contracts if any made by the Secretary of the Interior under Section 5 Gila prior to the date of the approval and consent by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.906" offset="14167019">So there was, at least a possibility that the Secretary would make contracts under an effective Project Act before the tri-state compact became affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.495" offset="14217383">I may say this is also further evidence that Congress did contemplate the Secretary making an interstate allocation because it says that any later arrangement by the States as to what their allocations must be is to be subject to the contract he has already made, which certainly speaks in terms of a Secretary of interstate allocations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.083" offset="14323754">Then the third reason for assuming that these were concluding, that these two paragraphs of Section 4 (a) go together is in the legislative history because I shall saw in a moment all the way through to the last page, the paragraphs where in terms of the conjunctive and the chains that was made to make the second paragraph permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.723" offset="14442245">It was not in terms of its operating as an alternative to the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.239" offset="14468368">Our third reason for thinking that the statute does contemplate a federal apportionment is simply as a matter of commonsense, the commonsense logic to the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.357" offset="14528763">Congress was concerned with water which the project would make available when the water that would come down for Lake Mead -- from the Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.552" offset="14569618">And what would be more natural in the event of despite between the State than for Congress to indicate how the water was to be allocated and to authorize its delegate to fill in the gaps that it left.</text>

            <text syncTime="3826.457" offset="15409194">The three things which I ask you to keep in mind, there're three of us running through it, what I think were assumptions of the basis of which everyone discussed this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.448" offset="15461125">I mean the statute in Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3884.409" offset="15641057">I said three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.454" offset="15645236">I was going to say dealing with the mainstream waters and an assumption that there was 7,500,000 acre-feet which was very clearly in their assumption all the way through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.015" offset="15699466">The background of controversy was outlined and outlined very accurately as I see it by Mr. Wilmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.466" offset="15741262">The problem was to get some kind of assurance for the Upper Basin States that the Lower Basin States wouldn't appropriate all this water once Congress had made it usable in order to assure them since they anticipated that they would develop later that there would be some water left for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.233" offset="15832273">And the problem also from California's point of view since she would be the first in the Lower Basin of the use water was to find some way of getting Arizona to go along or to state converts Arizona either have to be satisfied sufficiently to go along or else there had to be some kind of a provision written into the Act whereby all the rest of the States were willing to say, "Well Arizona, you can go your own way, fight it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.860" offset="15962781">We are satisfied with this and we think this sufficiently protects the Upper Basin.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.438" offset="15989112">Now, the history as I understand the evolution of problem goes back at least until 1925.</text>

            <text syncTime="4507.809" offset="18134601">She was interested in getting the used of the Gila as against the rivals in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4524.902" offset="18202937">As a practical matter you see, the Gila either has to be used in Arizona or used virtually in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.693" offset="18234180">There maybe a little you can divert out, but it's pretty much one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.911" offset="18251003">And they want to -- they didn't want to have the Gila charge with water perfection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.935" offset="18271065">And you will find that also in one of the subdivision of the second paragraph of Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.059" offset="18303561">But now, after the Governors' conference whereas I say there was apparently no dispute about tributaries that where attention was out focusing set -- was an allocating 7,500,000 other than the water at tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4568.613" offset="18377853">We turn to the situation in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.285" offset="18396557">In May 1928, there was a debate in the Senate on this subject.During the course of that debate, Senator Pittman introduced what really became after some changes, the substance of Section 4 (a) of the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.875" offset="18490911">He said it was -- it's found at pages 24 and 25 of the Arizona legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.040" offset="18519542">He said, "This was based on the recommendations of the Governors' conference."</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.657" offset="18542007">Except that in the interim, something has been discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.583" offset="18557680">They discovered that they forgot about 1,000,000 acre-feet in the mainstream in addition to the 7,500,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.479" offset="18597282">And so he drew up a proposal which attempted to incorporate the Governor's recommendations plus an equal division of that additional 1,000,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.122" offset="18655901">And if you read, I will check to it now.</text>

            <text syncTime="4680.572" offset="18825697">In other words, it was going to be something in addition to what was done under the first paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.943" offset="18851192">And if you take the Pittman Amendment as a whole, there is just no way of reading it other than saying that it was talking about the mainstream that gave the Gila to Arizona, which I can't see any other way in briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.793" offset="18946591">We come to the climax of the Senate debate in December, 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.848" offset="18982745">There was a very revealing debate there at that time, and the Act was passed in that same session in the closing days of the year.</text>

            <text syncTime="4733.684" offset="19038124">There was bill before the Senate, which has been introduced by Senator Johnson of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.200" offset="19068217">It proposed to break this impasse by giving California 4,600,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.162" offset="19104057">I didn't say anything about Gila and so far as I can see, it didn't say anything very revealing one way or the other on the issue before us except that it used 4,600,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.138" offset="19151914">Then Senator Hayden introduced as amendment to the Johnson bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.730" offset="19182320">An amendment is exactly the words of this Pittman proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.893" offset="19210951">It would have differed from the California proposal from the Johnson bill clearly and then it limited California to 4,200,00.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.753" offset="19250343">It would also seem to me but I'll take judicial argument if that clearly gave the Gila the tributaries of Arizona and we clearly come -- clearly concentrated at the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.467" offset="19309275">The debate that -- debate will call it became one over the difference between California's claim to 4,600,000 plus one half of the surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.888" offset="19362879">And Arizona's insistence that California should have over 4,200,000 plus one half of the surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.216" offset="19404257">There was very little explicit mentioned of the fact but it seems plain that everyone at that time was talking about 7,500,000 acre-feet plus an uncertain surplus of mainstream one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.203" offset="19464234">I say that's clear because of the two halves to the Hayden proposal if you read both halves, if you read one in the light of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.781" offset="19502477">The Gila necessarily was not included.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.067" offset="19515643">I would say it furthermore because the light of the Governor's recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.864" offset="19546781">No one who was taking in terms of the apportionment of anything other than the mainstream could possibly have said as a number of them did in that State that the difference was oddly between 4,600,000 and 4,200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4877.878" offset="19614908">Now, there were in fact expressions from all the Senators prominently engaged with the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.511" offset="19657435">Let me say the word in fact expressions from this -- from the Senators most prominently engaged in the debate would seem to me to indicate that they all knew or assume that they were talking about mainstream one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.591" offset="19713755">Senator Pittman is quoted on page 67 of the Arizona legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.107" offset="19751790">There is practically nothing involved except in dispute between the States of Arizona and California with regard to division of the increased water that will be impounded behind the proposed dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.891" offset="19794944">That is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.732" offset="19802258">Now skipping down to the end of the quotation of the 7,500,000 acre-feet of water let down that river they have gotten together within 400,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.548" offset="19857533">They've got to get together that not Congress should bring them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.737" offset="19874356">Senator Hayden repeatedly spoke of the amounts of water to be received from the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.893" offset="19914898">Senator Johnson himself -- I'm now reading from 70 (Inaudible) record at the page 237, spoke of what was the fight was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4972.768" offset="19994415">He said that the discussions relating to the use of water in California, in Denver and indeed here and elsewhere, it is the -- it is only the mainstreams that Your Honors will recall that has been discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.848" offset="20046764">The tributaries of the Colorado River in Arizona have a flow of at least 3,500,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.879" offset="20078843">Arizona's claim in writing on some occasions that it runs 6,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.915" offset="20099009">So what it is proposed that California will take 4,200,000 acre-feet and Arizona at 3,000,000 acre-feet plus one half at each instance from the surplus water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.053" offset="20151568">It means in reality that California shall be accorded 4,200,000 acre-feet plus one half of the surplus and then at least 6,500,000 acre-feet plus one half of the surplus shall go to Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.420" offset="20205066">So he had no doubt that he was representing California that they were talking about the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="5031.914" offset="20230980">And then he says, a little further down, “To divide the mainstream 4,600,000 acre-feet to California and 2,600,000 acre-feet to Arizona still gives Arizona more than 60% of the water from the Colorado River.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.787" offset="20302555">He meant and tributaries there clearly or nearly two thirds there up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.860" offset="20326797">So that -- I think this -- well, it's to 70 congressional record 237.</text>

            <text syncTime="5128.499" offset="20617383">And then there had been the Hayden Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.100" offset="20631803">Senator Phipps then offered an amendment which was designed to give California 4,600,000 instead of the 4,200,000 which was proposed in the depending Hayden Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.947" offset="20695124">There could have been a vote or straight out on the Phipps Amendment as a matter of parliamentary law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.516" offset="20725426">Well, the Senate decided not to do that because there were two differences according to Hayden Amendment and the Phipps Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.414" offset="20756982">One difference was in the amount of water specified in the California Limitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.161" offset="20779969">The other difference was that while the Hayden Amendment contemplated a seven State Compact but it would have still made the whole act in addition to Arizona's ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.342" offset="20836707">The Phipps Amendment contemplated a six State Compact plus the California Limitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.509" offset="20865442">That Senator Hayden desired to have these two issues was voted on separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.487" offset="20885295">And so what they did was they'd agreed that Senator Hayden would withdraw his Amendment that the Phipps Amendment would be offered proposing 4,600,000 and a six State Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.117" offset="20955826">And then Senator Hayden simply moved to strike out the 4,600,000 and substitute the 4,200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.584" offset="20985710">Senator Phipps' motion lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="5224.006" offset="20999398">Senator Bratton then proposed the 4,400,000 and that motion was carried and was certain perfected changes the Phipps Amendment became the first paragraph of Section 4 (a) of the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.191" offset="21080168">Now, I repeat once more that the whole debate seems to me to focus especially when one remembers the prior historical incidence and the assumptions in the prior proposal that they were allocating the mainstream and the Gila would go to Arizona as indeed, remember it did clearly in the second paragraph of the Hayden Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.092" offset="21191764">But at that point, Senator Hayden now has left with the second paragraph of his Amendment hanging.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.374" offset="21220916">So he rose and moved that the second paragraph of his original Amendment be added to the Phipps Amendment which had already been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.365" offset="21280789">You will find the second paragraph which is much like -- which is identical with the second paragraph of the Pittman proposal and the original Hayden Amendment set forth on page 98 and 99 of the Arizona legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.431" offset="21365112">The part that I wish to emphasized is in his statement reprinted over on page 102 where he said, “The first part of my Amendment is a mere corollary to the Amendment offered by the Senator from Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.163" offset="21428015">It provides that the remainder of the 7,500,000 acre-feet there apportion to this -- there shall be apportioned to the State of Nevada of 300,000 acre-feet to the State of Arizona 2,800,000 acre-feet, which combined with the 4,400,000 which the State of California will use completely exhaust the 7,500,000 acre-feet apportioned in perpetuity to the Lower Basin.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.912" offset="21535013">Now remember, he was describing the first part of an Amendment which in the third part gave Arizona the Gila in addition to all of this, as is the case in the third part of the second paragraph of 4 (a) statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.728" offset="21606275">So then it grew up opposition to Senator Hayden's proposal in only one respect that this goes to provide for Judge Stewart phrase later.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.102" offset="21667819">One of the subdivisions of Senator Hayden's proposal said that the Gila should be free from any burden with respect to the perspective of Mexican Treaty that Senator Johnson objected very vigorously to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.551" offset="21745560">He didn't object so far as I can find anywhere in the record to the recitation that Arizona was getting the Gila in addition to the apportionment made by the Phipps Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.670" offset="21802088">Indeed, the language of the debate indicates that he knew very well what had happened and that the only thing he was currently fighting about was the attempt to exempt the Gila from part of the burden of the Mexican treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.057" offset="21871574">At 70 conversional record, beginning at page 466, what has a long debate to dial -- to find myself to his little (Inaudible) as I can between Senator Hayden and Senator Johnson about this proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.666" offset="21954017">In the course of it, Mr. Johnson said, "What Arizona says that she has but 2,800,000 acre-feet of water."</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.985" offset="21991320">That's what she just had been given by the Phipps Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.545" offset="22005530">“To that, there must be added the Gila River with its 3,000,000 and 3,500,000.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5481.231" offset="22028309">That's very little.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.694" offset="22034160">“And then it will be found that Arizona has in reality two thirds of the water of the Colorado itself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5489.095" offset="22059760">Then he goes on to say, "If we should exempt as possibly we may -- should this Amendment be inducted, the Gila River from any burden or any servitude that might thereafter attached because of water to Mexico.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.525" offset="22109497">We should then exempt from burying its just share to paraphrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.757" offset="22130395">And a little later, there is a -- in the colloquy between Mr. Hayden and Mr. Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.514" offset="22153383">Mr. Hayden said, “The Senate has settled it by a vote that California may have 4,400,000 acre-feet of that water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.035" offset="22187551">It follows logically that if that demand is to be conceded as everybody agrees, the remainder is 2,800,000 acre-feet for Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.398" offset="22224959">That settles that part of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.856" offset="22234781">Senator Johnson, “How much from the Gila?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.302" offset="22248573">“Whatever is in it", Mr. Hayden replied."</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.587" offset="22257768">That is ours anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.807" offset="22266650">It's yours anyhow?"</text>
            <text syncTime="5542.059" offset="22271561">“Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.167" offset="22276054">“Then your Amendment is of no use?</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.198" offset="22284204">If that is yours anyhow then you're already on your tributaries, what are you putting this in for?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.817" offset="22302595">And the reply was that, “I'm putting in to except it from the Mexican treaty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5554.353" offset="22320776">There are two different problems here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.942" offset="22327150">One is the allocation.One is the burden of treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.937" offset="22339166">And when he said that's the burden of the treaty, Mr. Johnson said, “That's exactly what I objected.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.820" offset="22370617">And then Mr. Johnson after bringing that out and saying he objected said, "Alright, I'll accept your figure of 3,500,000 for the Gila."</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.483" offset="22413354">Now, in the division of Mr. Johnson, now, in the division of water with Senate sought it to impose yesterday, Arizona had 2,800,000 acre-feet and 3,500,000 from the Gila, did it not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.219" offset="22472286">“That is correct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5595.071" offset="22483675">Then Mr. Johnson goes on and said, "Then you wish to put on the California and Arizona equally the burden of the Mexican treaty" and says that's what he objects it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.310" offset="22520560">So it seems --</text>

            <text syncTime="5624.098" offset="22599764">I was skipping over about three pages, 466 to 469 would cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.715" offset="22626200">I may say incidentally that the full debate of this December session of the Senate is not terribly long and I found it myself more convenient to read it in here that -- while this is a very helpful job of excerpts, really isn't so long that one can't get the feel of it and going through the whole thing in reasonably short time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.911" offset="22723062">The part that I was seeking was one further thought that I was wish to emphasize that in this debate, after Senator Hayden and Senator Johnson got at loggerheads about burden of the Mexican treaty, then Senator Pittman came in and said, "Well, I don't think it's right to impose a tri-state compact terms of which we have specified as a condition of this active Congress being effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.381" offset="22856913">Let's tell the States that they can enter into this Compact and we'll give them advance ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.455" offset="22889200">But let's not impose it on all three of them the way we imposed the California Limitation Act on California."</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.238" offset="22920338">And Senator Hayden agreed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5707.428" offset="22933086">And they changed was then made, which you now find in the beginning of the second paragraph of Section 4 (a) which says the three States may enter into this treaty rather than they must.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.283" offset="22996511">But it would have been extraordinary at that stage having treated this as two parts of the same thing, all the way through to have jumped and made this permissive thing an alternative to the first paragraph, and then the discussion was certainly in terms of being two parts of the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.069" offset="23079685">And I submit therefore that the meaning of one throws a great deal of light indeed if it is not controlling.</text>

            <text syncTime="6049.080" offset="24299708">Well Congress of California -- now, I don't think that's quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6055.294" offset="24324577">Let me restate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6056.389" offset="24328965">I'm not sure if I understand you but let me, if I restate it what I tried to say I'll make it clear.What California says, "We were intended at a minimum yet 4,400,000 acre-feet."</text>
            <text syncTime="6061.957" offset="24351222">Now, the most you can say that was apportioned to the Lower Basin by the Compact is 8,500,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6086.455" offset="24449233">This means that if we say 2,000,000 for the Gila, it would be 6,500,000 in the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="6100.976" offset="24507225">And if Arizona gets the Gila plus this allocation of the mainstream according to Master's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="6108.513" offset="24537422">This allocation of 6,500,000 in the mainstream then we won't get the 4,400,000 that Congress clearly intended as to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="6118.784" offset="24578487">And therefore, the assumption that the Gila is to be excluded from the accounting must be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6127.111" offset="24611819">Now, I think there are two faults, two evident faults in that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.642" offset="24641912">In the first place, Congress assault beyond question that there were 7,500,000 acre-feet available in the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.278" offset="24696456">And with respect to determining what was the intent of Congress during the course of this debate of what can make an assumption contrary to the assumption that Congress was making.</text>
            <text syncTime="6160.837" offset="24746715">The second difficulty with this is that saying, "Two million --” that it making the Compact counting and charging 2,000,000 for the Gila, this assumes a disputed question about the way in terms of water, the Gila uses are to be charged in disputed question as to whether the charge is the depletions of the mainstreams fly or divergence less returns to the stream, upstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="6194.688" offset="24882134">Another assumption that make which is certainly debated is that the reservoir losses are not to be included in the account, the evaporation that Mr. Ely was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="6208.447" offset="24937200">But if one goes to a compact counting, it doesn't make much difference under the Master's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="6216.322" offset="24968652">That question too would have to be looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="6219.260" offset="24980459">But I think that the really basic point is that the Congress -- one of the three essentials assumptions it made was that there were 7,500,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6233.087" offset="25035734">And therefore, you can't interpret what the Senator said by making a different assumption what they do.</text>

            <text syncTime="6301.980" offset="25311274">What gets appealing that there was a -- that they didn't think much about this probable evaporation loses or other stream loses between Lee Ferry and Lake Mead, and that maybe they didn't think about the additions in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6319.114" offset="25379819">They spoke more generally of water let down.</text>
            <text syncTime="6321.988" offset="25391313">Well, that would seem to me Lee Ferry but it was simply in terms of water in the river without this kind of precise measurement, which is certainly necessary here in the writing the appraisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6336.363" offset="25448782">So the way it lies in my mind is that the core of their meaning, it was made mainstream and not the Gila is presently clear but their precise definition of mainstream is pretty hard to get out of the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6353.302" offset="25516596">If there is anything that prevails, it is the 7,500,000 coming down at Lee Ferry as you suggest.</text>

            <text syncTime="6484.634" offset="26041866">I had put it in absolute terms that what has to face this kind of question and his recommendations concerning it, I think would that be accepted by all parties as they're willing to accept if the thesis of his decree stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="6504.538" offset="26121488">I've now completed with the legislative history simply summarizing very briefly the conclusions that I draw from it, are that all the way through after those early negotiations, there was an assumption that the waters apportioned by Article III (a) for 7,500,000 million feet of mainstream water and that the excess was the mainstream waters in excess of 7,500,000 acre-feet which would include the Article III (b) (1) since not everything in excess of 7,500,000 acre-feet and borrowing the questions about the diversion above Lake Mead that of course is the conclusion that the Master has written.</text>
            <text syncTime="6554.166" offset="26320018">Conversely, it seems to me to have been assumed and agreed by everyone concerned from the initial direct discussions between Arizona and California on that Arizona was getting the Gila in addition to whatever allocation was made out of the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="6577.144" offset="26411969">Now, I come to the question that was raised earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6583.694" offset="26438196">And that is don't, Sections 14 and 18, indicate that Congress was not making a federal allocation but rather that the entire right -- the entire question was to be decided in accordance with state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6606.897" offset="26530983">The Master partly accepted and partly rejected that notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6614.643" offset="26561912">So far as the interstate controversy is concerned, he wholly rejected the notion and as he said, “There is nothing in Section 14 and nothing in Section 18 that quite in a different direction that all the indications in Sections 4, 5 and 6 that there is to be a contractual allocation by the Secretary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6640.660" offset="26665984">He accepted the notion Justice Douglas to this extent.</text>
