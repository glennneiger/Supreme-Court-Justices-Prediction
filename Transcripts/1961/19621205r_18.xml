            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="15.356" offset="164760">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.617" offset="181791">This case which is here on direct appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act to the District Court for the Western District of Missouri, presents the question of the constitutionality of the provision in Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act which makes it a crime to sell goods at unreasonably low prices for the purpose of destroying competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.444" offset="273115">The District Court in this case, dismissed the number of counts under that section, on the ground that the statutory provision is so vague and indefinite as to violate the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.075" offset="327659">The appellee, National Dairy Company, is a large company engaged in the business of purchasing, processing, distributing and selling milk throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.450" offset="377187">The violations involved in this indictment involved the area of Kansas and Missouri which is served by National's plant in Kansas City.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.951" offset="427133">Now, in this big two-state area, National sells directly to customers in the Kansas City area itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.573" offset="461615">And in the rural areas throughout these two states, it sells through distributors and the indictment alleged that in such sales, National competes both with other large dairies and also with a number of small dairies.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.980" offset="535280">The indictment was in 15 counts and it charges National Dairy in parallel counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.353" offset="560776">That is a count under the Sherman Act followed by a count under the Robinson-Patman Act relating to various activities in numerous markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.740" offset="606333">More specifically under the Robinson-Patman Act, National and in one count a Mr. Wise, its vice-president and director, are charged with selling at unreasonably low prices for destroying competition in each of seven different areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.675" offset="694105">The counts are basically identical under all the Robinson-Patman Act charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.545" offset="717511">And I would like to invite the Court's attention to the first of the Robinson-Patman Act charges at page 9 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.242" offset="748335">This is typical of the Robinson-Patman Act counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.791" offset="770487">The offense charged is stated in paragraphs 22 and 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.032" offset="795460">The first paragraph, paragraph 22 begins, and in the language of the statute said that National are engaged in the foresaid interstate commerce sold milk to its distributor in the Paola-Osawatomie, Kansas market at unreasonably low prices for the purpose of destroying competition in that market in violation of Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.927" offset="895039">Then the second paragraph, paragraph 23 goes on and particularizes the sales of unreasonably low prices charged in the statutory language in paragraph 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.067" offset="943626">It alleged -- pursuant to an effectuation of the offense, National utilized the advantages it possesses by reason of the fact that it operates in a great many different geographical localities in order to finance and subsidize a price war against small dairies selling milk in competition with it and its distributor in the Paola market.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.881" offset="1042892">By intentionally selling milk to its distributor Martin at prices below National's cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.420" offset="1073089">So what we have in this indictment is a charge that in this particular market and there's seven of them, National sold at unreasonably low prices for the purpose of destroying competition and the particularization without the sales at unreasonably low prices here charged where sales below cost.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="285.394" offset="1244975">Well, let me put it this way if I may, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.432" offset="1257096">I think the Court has to look at the statute first to see whether it is --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="294.696" stopTime="296.370">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="294.696" offset="1282173">It was charged from the beginning.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="296.370" stopTime="883.174">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="296.370" offset="1288861">Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.053" offset="1291577">But then all that the Court has to do to sustain the statute in this case is to say that at least, as applied to the sales charged in this case, selling below cost, the statute clearly does provide a sufficiently definite standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.724" offset="1350301">But I shall, in my argument, first argue generally as to what the statutory standard is and then go on to show that without having to reach what maybe a more difficult problems in other cases, it certainly is constitutional to decide the violation here charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.061" offset="1415607">Now, the statute is set forth at pages 2 and 3 of our brief on re-argument and the statute contains three subsections.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.815" offset="1466598">The first two of them deal with discrimination in price and the third subdivision which is the one on which we are here concerned which is on lines four to seven of page 3, makes it a crime to sell or contract to sell goods at unreasonably low prices for the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.468" offset="1561266">So the statute is composed of two elements in addition to the sale of the goods that must be at unreasonably low prices and it must be for the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.325" offset="1616645">Now, while I said that these are separate elements and the Government must prove both of them, we think the elements are interrelated.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.366" offset="1648828">And we think that the ‘unreasonably low prices'; the meaning of that phrase draws its meaning and has helped in interpretation by the second clause, the specific purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.785" offset="1702536">In other words, we think that the frame of reference within which the meaning of ‘unreasonably low prices' is to be determined is the second section requiring for conviction the purpose of destroying competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.652" offset="1765961">We think as I shall now demonstrate that this clause from the basic purpose of the statute from its legislative history and from our entire antitrust experience of more than half a century dealing with predatory pricing, what the statute is directed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.258" offset="1836387">Now, a major purpose of the Robinson-Patman Act, and when I say the Robinson-Patman Act here, I'm not limiting it just to Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.257" offset="1876407">I also include the civil price discrimination provisions contained in Section 2 of the Clayton Act was to prevent predatory pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.020" offset="1915486">That is pricing which is designed to destroy competition or eliminate a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.570" offset="1945684">This statute was written against the history of many years of our experience under the antitrust laws with the devices by which monopolists and powerful firms have been able to destroy their competition to put competitors out of business, to force weaker firms into cooperation with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.347" offset="2040769">And this history had shown that one of the favorite devices which these large firms and monopolists employed was cutting prices in warfare against a smaller firm, and in most instances of course, what was done was using the profits in one area when they were not competing in order to attack a weaker competitor and another but not all and this history is shown in some of the early landmark Sherman Act cases which we have described in our brief, for example, this Court's decision in the American Tobacco case, the decision of Judge Learned Hand as the district judge in Corn Products case and both of these leading cases, sales below costs were a very effective method by which these tremendous combinations were put together in which competition was suppressed and by which recalcitrant smaller firms were driven to the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.367" offset="2304815">And in 1914, when Congress passed the original Clayton Act, it referred to this practice and the House Committee report which we have quoted in our brief stated that it was a common practice of great and powerful combinations to lower prices of their commodities oftentimes below the cost of production in certain communities and sections where they had competition with the intent to destroy and make unprofitable to the business of their competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.752" offset="2426337">And similarly, as we've set out in our brief, the legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act shows congressional concern with this predatory price cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.447" offset="2469177">Now, most of the legislative history dealing with the Robinson-Patman Act related again to discrimination and it was in many instances, this was what being discussed but not all of it there is evidence for example that people were terribly concerned about the practice of this large firms cutting prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.695" offset="2558203">Now, in terms of the effect on competition, it doesn't really matter whether the large firm is cutting prices in one area and using its profits in another area to subsidize them or whether it's big enough that it can afford to take a loss in a particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.583" offset="2629674">In both instances, the smaller firm that is faced with this price cutting find itself in the position that it can't hold up very long, it's either going to go out of business or it may find that it just has to give in.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.501" offset="2689337">It's going to stop its price warfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.248" offset="2696338">Much of this price warfare in these areas is designed not to put someone out of business but to get them to bring their prices up to the level of the large firm thinks appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.942" offset="2739179">And all these experience in history to us illuminates what the Congress was driving at in this third clause of Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.146" offset="2791946">We think that what we have in Section 3 is this, we have the first two clauses which deal with price discriminations and those are made crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.707" offset="2838235">We have the third clause which then goes on to make it a crime to sell at unreasonably low prices for the purpose of destroying competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.992" offset="2875329">We think what Congress intended to reach by that clause was the same type of predatory practices that history have shown, were frequent methods by which large economic firms throw their competitors to the wall and which however did not come within the precise boundaries of the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.721" offset="2970206">I'd like to illustrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.018" offset="2979401">First of all, many large firms may sell multiple products.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.525" offset="3005524">So they have for example a firm selling milk at unreasonably low prices in a particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.076" offset="3035721">It would necessarily have to make that up on selling milk in other areas at higher prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.599" offset="3061739">It could make it up by selling butter or cheese or some other dairy products.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.344" offset="3076786">In that situation, there would not be discrimination than the meaning of Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.663" offset="3102072">Similarly, products such as milk, there are frequently local variations in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.180" offset="3132061">The nature of the milk industry as such that milk is sold at different prices so that the mere proof that a company sold milk at one price in the Kansas City, Missouri market and at another price in the Chicago market might not itself be sufficient to establish discrimination and therefore we think what Congress did was to go on and prohibit sales at unreasonably low prices the same kind of predatory sales which did not however have the particular element of discrimination which is condemned by Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.284" offset="3272495">And we think in the light of this experience and this purpose that the phrase to sell unreasonably low prices for the purpose of destroying competition means that a price is unreasonably low when it lacks any rational foundation in the seller's normal business methods which would justify it being said other than a purpose to destroy competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.368" offset="3380851">Let me illustrate if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.262" offset="3396420">Ordinarily, a seller operates at a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.358" offset="3416795">Now, if a seller is selling a product at a price which could not be justified by the business considerations, the exigencies of the business which a reasonable man would rely on in setting his prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.076" offset="3491715">And if you add to that, the further specific intent, the predatory purpose the intention to destroy competition, we think that is selling at unreasonably low price for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.183" offset="3556080">And we think certainly, at least where the product is priced below cost with the predatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.939" offset="3591084">This is plainly an unreasonably low price.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.490" offset="3605295">There may be situations of course in which selling below price, below cost has a legitimate business purpose for example --</text>

            <text syncTime="1478.008" offset="6015352">Just unreasonable charges, unreasonable waste of natural gas, a host of standards which this Court has adopted and I think Mr. Justice Holmes' statement in the Nash case many years ago in upholding the Sherman Act is very pertinent here in which he pointed out that the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends upon its estimating rightly that is as the jury subsequently estimates at some manner of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.375" offset="6132903">And also, in the Regan case in which this Court upheld a criminal indictment involving charges of deducting more than a reasonable allowance for compensation pointed out that the mere fact that appeal statute is so framed as to require a jury upon occasion to determine a question of reasonableness is not sufficient to make it too vague to afford a practical guide to permissible conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.383" offset="6248887">Now, I just like to say one thing with respect to the cases upon which our opponents rely and which this Court has struck down statutes as unduly vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.968" offset="6291205">The leading case of course is the Cohen case which said that a prohibition on willfully charging unjust or unreasonable prices for necessaries was bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.879" offset="6334882">We think the basic distinction between that case and the other cases that they rely on -- and this case is that in those cases, the standards of unreasonable prices were just up in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.185" offset="6380126">It was not tied to any specific thing by which you could identify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.420" offset="6397053">There's no basic purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.318" offset="6408652">And in this case, we think, that the statute does get meaning after two facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.383" offset="6432893">First, it appears not just unreasonable prices but unreasonably low, and unreasonably low, we think in the light of our antitrust history discloses a basic concept here, predatory prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.027" offset="6487437">And in addition to that here, in contrast to the Cone case where the only intent was the requirement of willfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.366" offset="6516799">In this case, we have the specific intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.236" offset="6528293">And in conclusion, I just like to suggest to the Court that I find it difficult to see really how the Congress could draw a more definite standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.199" offset="9380133">I think I should remind the Court -- I'm sure it's unnecessary to do so but I think I should remind the Court at the outset, there is not one word in this statute about cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.302" offset="9428616">Sellers cost or anybody else's cost or the word cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.430" offset="9449096">The statute says it shall be an offense to sell at unreasonably low prices for the prescribed intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.130" offset="9491937">That's what the statute says and that's all the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.192" offset="9508133">Now, the Government has made a halfway admission, what I think they must and should admit mainly that this statute has two separate and distinct elements of which would -- which must constitute the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.064" offset="9579604">First is selling below cost and the second is with the intent to destroy competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.258" offset="9608443">Now, each must be proved, the Government admits that, and yet, and yet, the Government contends in effect that though they are separate and distinct, though they are separate and distinct, selling below cost which isn't even mentioned in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.440" offset="9685138">Selling below cost proves at least prima facie, both that the sale at the price was unreasonable and that the price -- and that the intent was anticompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.766" offset="9746474">Now, I think in order to straighten out this situation in the light of the words of the statute itself, I should have the temerity to start by reminding the Court of the Cohen Grocery case, of Cline against Frink Dairy and of the many cases which have followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.301" offset="9864547">They have held expressly and explicitly that the term ‘unreasonably high price' or ‘unreasonably low price' or ‘unreasonable price', or ‘unreasonable profit' is unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.289" offset="9944482">Now, those decisions are expressed and there they are and the Cohen case has been woven into the firm fabric of the law of this nation and it has been referred to by this Court over and over again, and as a matter of fact a -- a situation which the Government has not referred to in its brief or in the record when this very clause, the Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act was before this Court in the Nashville Milk case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2864.933" offset="11563133">In the first place, below cost is not necessarily unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.915" offset="11579016">There are many instances where below cost is perfectly reasonable, some have been mentioned by Mr. Justice White, others occurred to us all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2891.682" offset="11670131">The fact of the matter is that prices are set before the sale is made of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.802" offset="11698552">Certain prices are set if period goes by during which production takes place, the manufacturer does not sell a volume that he thinks he's going to or else other circumstances contribute to increase cost and it ends up that he sells below cost as it finally determined on the books of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.340" offset="11772740">I say that since there are so many instances and other instances were given by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3668.830" offset="14778702">At adjournment, Mr. Justice Goldberg, I was attempting to comment upon the question that Your Honor asked or a comment which Your Honor made which was in effect that the Congress doesn't have to write a detailed code of accounting in the statute, and of course I think that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.449" offset="14861145">We do have -- I do -- I would like to make two or three comments on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.892" offset="14878908">First is that if Congress meant to outlaw below cost selling, they didn't do so, that is they didn't specifically refer to below cost selling at any time nor does the legislative history indicate that they meant to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.491" offset="14941288">And the second is that if the Congress did mean to outlaw below cost selling, I think we're entitled to some specification as to what is meant by a cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.312" offset="14980577">Now, that doesn't mean in any way a detailed specification of course, that would be out of place in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.325" offset="15008684">But assuming that it is meant seller's own cost which is what the Government contends over here, seller's own cost even if you look just at the seller's books and nothing else, doesn't define what the Congress meant by cost but for the reason that got into my answers to Mr. Justice Black's question that is, it is very, very questionable as to what cost should mean or would mean unless Congress defines it in a situation of this sort as was said in this Small case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.348" offset="15160717">There is no general understanding as to what a reasonable or unreasonable price is so that the Lever Act will struck down both in its civil aspects and in its criminal aspects in the Small case for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.371" offset="15220903">Likewise, we say here, there is no general business understanding as to what a sale of below cost would mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.614" offset="15245876">Does it mean the invoice price that the seller paid for the goods?</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.155" offset="15271999">Does it mean production cost in the case of a manufacturer who has labor cost, material cost and all the rest in his plant?</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.386" offset="15304913">Does it mean in addition to that that the seller should include overhead cost of the type that are quite controversial which would include general administrative and the like?</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.887" offset="15350888">Now, the Congress would not have to specify all that but we say they could give some guidelines that would make it reasonably clear what the statute was meant to cover as indeed the states have done and the states had have sales below cost provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.351" offset="15412746">But basically, I want to state and reiterate that our position is that there's no word -- nothing about cost in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3846.455" offset="15489233">And if Your Honor please, on that connection, I would like to call the Court's attention to our brief, pages 82 to 83 in which we have collected all of the cases that have raised the question of vagueness of the statute under the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.001" offset="15559346">And we state there that so far as we have been able to determine in every case brought to this Court, on direct appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act, after the District Court had held an act of Congress unconstitutional for vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.270" offset="15616502">This Court has looked to the face of the statute and has determined the matter on the face of the statute otherwise, otherwise and we list the cases in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.222" offset="15656312">The constitutional doctrine of vagueness, it seems to us, could never be decided except after trial and that has not been the case because we are entitled we say to a specification in the statute rather than in the indictment as to what we must do to comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.313" offset="15736665">And following what I said to Mr. Justice Goldberg a moment ago when a client consults counsel on a matter of this kind, you're unable to tell him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.933" offset="15775117">Well, you've got to go below production cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.236" offset="15784312">I mean you've got to stay above production cost but you don't have to worry about fully distributed cost and all of these problems of allocating to particular products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.219" offset="15816286">It is true as Mr. Friedman said that many corporations make a great variety of products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.213" offset="15836244">What sort of overhead must be allocated, some specification in the statute as in the statutes of the states, we contend, should be specified if the Congress meant to outlaw sales below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.237" offset="15900296">I would also like to comment for a moment on the rule of reason question which I believe was brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.478" offset="15929240">I think Mr. Justice Goldberg referred to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.344" offset="15944704">+Inclined, the Court, Cline against Frink Dairy, the Court there distinguished the holding of the Nash case which upheld the constitutionality of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.343" offset="15996740">From Cohen and the price cases, holding that the there has been no ascertainable business standard for the meaning of unreasonably low prices or as there has been a standard for many years both in the common law and of course in the statute law or -- and the case law here as to the meaning of the rule of reason in antitrust cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.595" offset="16097782">That distinction was pointed out clearly in the Cline case and we think it is applicable of course to the situation in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.082" offset="16135711">The unreasonably low price clause requires the alleged transgressor to know from the statute what his price ought to be in dollars and cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.398" offset="16180955">He must be able to determine it whereas under the rule of reason the question is whether competition has been reduced and that is an ascertainable matter which of course is submitted to the jury in those cases where the rule of reason is invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.660" offset="16250023">I think the problem we have here on this cost question is illustrated by the position the Government has taken here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.157" offset="16292028">The contrary positions they have taken with respect to cost in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.329" offset="16308642">They say at one point, the Government brief 40, all appellees had to do was to sell above cost being the question as to the meaning of cost, if so they would be safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.691" offset="16350124">At another point, at Government brief page 37, they say that certain borderline cases may arise where the selling price is above the seller's cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.137" offset="16391920">But it is argued that the property is too small for the price to be reasonable which would indicate that the Government itself is uncertain as to whether there could be situations arise where a sale above cost would be claimed by the Government to be at an unreasonable price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.406" offset="16469034">I think I should -- I would like to comment in closing that the nonuse of this statute for the 26 years since it has been in effect is it seems to me noteworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.613" offset="16541863">The fact of the matter is that this is the first case contested in the courts that has been brought under this statute, the second indictment that has been brought under the statute in the 26 years of its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.751" offset="16594422">The first one having been settled and having been brought in 1959, 23 years after the statute was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.399" offset="16629008">To say the least, the fact if its nonuse would indicate that it has not been an important part of the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.917" offset="16667042">I also want to make this observation in closing that the cases upon which we rely starting with Cohen, required seems to us, that this statute should be determined on its face to be invalid, to violate the rule against vagueness and that we and Mr. Wise, the individual defendant here as well as the corporation, are entitled to the protection of having that action taken so that he will not be put to trial on an indict -- on a statute, the meaning of which at this time and at no time had been made clear to him or to anyone else.</text>
