            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Chief Justice, just before the recess, I was attempting to emphasize the judicial functions perform by the Court of Claims and particularly sought to call attention to the fact that at least in some instances, it seems to perform judicial duties which must be performed by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.092" offset="207705">And I cited the determination of just compensation in the case of the taking is in illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.432" offset="233096">I would add to that a second category of business which results from the fact that the Court of Claims has jurisdiction not only of suits against the Government but also of not only set-offs but counterclaims against as those citizens or other person who are plaintiffs in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.063" offset="319613">And without attempting to particularize, it seems to me that there could be little doubt not only that this is the kind of business which is the daily grist of courts but that undoubtedly some of those counterclaims would involve claims by the United States against the citizen which could not be adjudicated finally outside a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.760" offset="410415">And we think this emphasizes again that this Court's business is in truth the kind of business which was thought of as part of the judicial power of the United States of the kind of business that the court normally dealt with and was equipped to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.186" offset="488155">Hereto, I think when other distinction is important and then I plan to drop this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.923" offset="515114">There was well recognized that the time the Constitution was adapted and in the earlier English Law and later in our law, a difference between sovereign immunity and the existence of a legal cause of action, if you will, against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.239" offset="600377">And what Court of Claims has been set up to deal with is not the distribution of large gist but the adjudication of these causes of action against the Government of the kind of cause of action that was well-known and could be maintained where ever the sovereign choose waive it's immunity not only prior to the adoption of the Constitution but in this cou -- in England, but in this country about that time and in various types of cases afterwards that points develop with a history in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.132" offset="739871">And I simply allude to adhere as further evidence that controversies to which the United States may be a party as a matter of recognized usage at the time the Constitution was adopted involved not only controversies in which the United States might be the moving party but controversies in which the United States would be defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.986" offset="839346">And in holding the contrary, it seems to us that the Williams case is wrong not only as a matter of logic but also as a matter of history.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="252.946" stopTime="450.774">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="252.946" offset="1115199">Well, we do -- we do make that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.272" offset="1128469">We do argue in our brief and I aser -- submit here that in the case of special courts set up that the seat of the Government with a limited jurisdiction that Congress may as held in the O'Donoghue case call upon them to perform non -- not strictly judicial duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.223" offset="1248214">I don't think our case depends on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.066" offset="1263679">And I think the Court of Claims can be held to be a constitutional court without reaching that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.898" offset="1298996">But the answer to Your Honor is yes, we do make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.359" offset="1316760">May I suggest that, because I was just going to develop this directly, that I try to develop affirmatively where we do stand on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.086" offset="1351764">And then if I haven't answered all the questions to Your Honors' mind, I'll try to do my best.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.264" offset="1376423">I was just about to say that what we have here is a tribunal which is a court like any Article III court or except in its place in the hierarchy like this Court in respect to all its business, in respect to all its powers, in respect to the tenure and compensation of its judges, in every respect except for this fringe congressional reference jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.495" offset="1505364">And if it were not for that, it would seem to me there was really nothing to be arguing about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.705" offset="1530232">The question then becomes how does this affect the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.258" offset="1548413">Well, I would say first, Mr. Chief Justice, that just as the existence of this congressional reference jurisdiction has never been thought to prevent all the rest of the Court of Claims business from being judicial and justiciable and from being cases and controversies such as this Court could review.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.739" offset="1634304">So it would seem to me that the existence of this fringed non-judicial duties should not be held to affect the quality of the judges' tenure that they have been set up predominantly for the purpose of exercising judicial power the Congress has sought in everyway that it could to give them constitutional tenure because it thought it was appropriate to the dispatch of the judicial business because, and it mentioned this specifically in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.067" offset="1767633">It would make them available for assignment to other courts and finally because it declared this was to be a constitutional court.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.678" offset="1802115">So I would submit that even if these other duties have been given that this should not take away from the judges their constitutional status.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.934" offset="1843075">And I point out that that was the holding in the O'Donoghue case although since we are asking the Court to reexamine many authorities in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.543" offset="1881527">I think the reexamination necessarily involves the O'Donoghue case, too.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.656" offset="1977971">And I would say first that I don't think there is any occasion to enter a part and inquiry into it, because the -- I do think that one could uphold the status of the judges without going into it.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.925" offset="2067101">There are three possible answers, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.548" offset="2085595">The first is that being a special tribunal and not like the normal courts this district and circuit courts that this fringed that the rule in Hayburn's Case does not apply in this fringe jurisdiction can be added.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="510.922" offset="2147035">Because it's in the District of Columbia or what?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="514.586" stopTime="557.098">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="514.586" offset="2161768">Or because it is a primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.525" offset="2169501">Because it is a special court which doesn't have the general jurisdiction, the adding of the non-judicial business therefore seems to me not to involve all the problems of overloading the court and the risk of destroying its independence which would be involved if you are dealing with the District Court and the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.871" offset="2258840">And this is not after all a rule Hayb -- Hayburn's case is not a rule which is written into the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.834" offset="2294680">It's a matter of preserving the independence of the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.126" offset="2307845">But I think there's room for recognition of some questions of degree.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.259" offset="2480358">It -- well, the second possible conclusion is that the judges may not be required to do this but just as judges have from time to time all through history in this country, voluntarily taken on additional responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.560" offset="2569592">So the judges of the Court of Claims may voluntarily take on this responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.466" offset="2601253">Finally, there would be of course Mr. Justice Stewart that the possible conclusion that this part of the Court of Claims jurisdiction must be excise.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.805" offset="2646601">I would make just one point with -- with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.156" offset="2663946">I think that Congress has attempted to make it a constitutional court.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.686" offset="2686098">It has also attempted to give them this jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.222" offset="2700309">Now, if you say you can't have both, it is quite clear to me that the primary intention of this difficulty was pointed out to the Congress hypothetically.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.995" offset="2747329">The primary intention was to make them a constitutional court.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.670" offset="2766033">And I would submit that if the Court should feel that it had to face this question of the congressional reference jurisdiction and if it felt it could not be given even to the specialized court and then it should give effect to the primary intention of Congress as it has declared it and the rule that the congressional reference jurisdiction could not be added to a constitutional court that if Congress wanted a tribunal that could do both, it would have to change its legislation around.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.328" offset="2900720">But I think really the point which I can see the being most significant is the one I have made first to with that the -- had the -- that the status of the judges who have the judicial power to exercise is -- is clear and that that is the only question involved here and that the effect of this once a year congressional reference shouldn't alter their constitutional status or Judge Madden's power to sit therefore as a constitutional judge in the Second Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.685" offset="3750118">In the first place, it seems to me reasonably clear that the framers of the Constitution were in cant and anxious to be certain that those exercising judicial power were independent and could not be put under the coercion by the other two branches of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.433" offset="3877073">They were thinking of judicial power, I suppose, in the traditional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.626" offset="3893896">Certainly, they could not have had in mind the kind of subtleties which we had been discussing today.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.702" offset="3934229">If they were thinking in terms of the jurisdiction customarily exercised by the Courts in Westminster, they were competent lawyers there whom I assume knew that going back as far as the 14th Century the Courts of Westminster to with Court of Chancery and the King's Bench had exercised just the kind of jurisdiction that is exercised by the Court of Claims, the petition of right, monstrans de droit, the traverses of office.</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.718" offset="4198275">And I would suppose that the Court of Claims needs the protection as much as any court in the judicial system that is likely to come into conflict with the Congress and the Executive Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.709" offset="4262222">It's not -- it's passing on large problems involving large sums of money but it's also passing on critical constitutional rights involving the Bill of Rights problems, involving civil rights problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.656" offset="4349994">There was before this Court in O'Donoghue the question of the independence of the judiciary coming up in the in the guise of the Pahy case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.938" offset="4467127">So that I would suppose that this was the kind of exercise of judicial power that the framers of the Constitution wanted to protect against the coercion of the other departments and that this Court would not deny that protection unless it's compelled by persuasive argument that the Constitution would not permit it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1125.805" offset="4606621">I would suppose that there was no contest about the proposition that the Constitution doesn't invest jurisdiction in any court except this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1164.024" offset="4759489">And I would have thought before the arguments in the Lurk case and this that there had never been any question that Congress might give as much or as little of the powers specified in the second section of Article III as it chose to give to such a court and that have ordained and established a court under Article III and give it nothing but the Tucker Act jurisdiction there'd be no doubt that it could established that as an Article III court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.892" offset="8078921">In the first place, Mr. Cox in talking about the timeliness of raising this jurisdictional question stated that if it were a matter of jurisdiction relating to the subject matter of the lawsuit that he agreed, as I recall his statement, that that jurisdictional question could be raised at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.956" offset="8199189">I say with equal emphasis that if there'd be a constitutional lack of capacity on the part of Judge Madden to sit in an Article III court that that jurisdictional objection may likewise be raised at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.329" offset="8280691">Now in fact, the judges of the Court of Claims when we filed a petition for certiorari in this Court, a petition was also filed by the judges of that court as amici curiae in support of the petition filed by the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.577" offset="8369716">And I would like briefly to call to Your Honors attention the statements contained on page 5 of that amici curiae brief in support of our petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.322" offset="8412662">Our petitioner apparently did not bring to the attention of the Court of Appeals the objection now made to Judge Madden's participation in the hearing and decision of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.426" offset="8457070">But as Mr. Justice Frankfurter noted in his dissent on other grounds in the Lurk case, the question raised by the petitioner is jurisdictional in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.442" offset="8501164">Such a jurisdictional point may be raised at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.411" offset="8521017">See McGrath against Kristensen which one of the cases upon which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.115" offset="8539826">If Judge Madden, and I'm still quoting from this brief of the judges of the Court of Claims, if Judge Madden because of constitutional prohibitions was not competent to serve, as petitioner contends, the judgment in which he participated is null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.716" offset="8614222">That is the end of my quote and the cited number of case upon which we rely and support of our position that we may raised this jurisdictional question at any time particularly during the course of these proceedings and particularly during the pendency of it and after this petition before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.583" offset="8693739">And in -- thirdly in reply to that contention made by the opposition, I would like to call Your Honors' attention the ruling of this Court in the case of Lamar against the United States decided in 1960 where a Christian was presented to the Court as to the constitutionality of making an assignment of one circuit judge to another circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.749" offset="8798333">The case was tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.208" offset="8848175">And I think there were further proceedings taken in this Court and I would like to very, very briefly to note that this Court in a unanimous opinion held that the question they raised was properly and fully considered and was passed upon by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.366" offset="8944828">We submit that authority along with the case of Donegan against Dyson which I have also quoted in my brief as authority to the effect that this Court has on numerous occasions or at least on a number of occasions considered that the making of application upon the hearing of a petition in this Court was timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.369" offset="9028838">At least, no objection -- no objection was made this court undertook to hear and determine the particular objection which was raised as to the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.816" offset="9070634">Now, reference had been made to Section 1492 of Title 28 of the United States Code which grants to the Court of Claims the power and the function to pass on these congressional reference cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.193" offset="9164152">At the time of the enactment of the Act of 1953 which undertook -- which was an undertaking by Congress to describe the Court of Claims as the -- an Article III court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2297.030" offset="9291525">Now, it is interesting to note that, and I would like to call to Your Honors attention the remarks made by Senator Gore at the time of the hearings held with respect to this 1953 Legislation and I referred to a footnote on page 12 of the petitioner's reply brief, in which Senator Gore stated, “If in the future, judges of the Court of Claims should refused to act upon congressional reference cases on the ground that they are not within the proper scope of jurisdiction of a constitutional court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.189" offset="9436139">I suppose a simple remedy will be for Congress to redesignate the Court of Claims as a legislative court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.228" offset="9472293">I refer that to Your Honors to indicate that Congress in describing this court as an Article III court has the feeling apparently that it may redesignate the court at anytime it sees fit to serve its purposes.</text>
