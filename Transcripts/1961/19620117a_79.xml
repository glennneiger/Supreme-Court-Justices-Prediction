            <label>Mr. Willis F. Daniels</label>
            <text syncTime="17.139" offset="171969">Mr. Chief Justice, Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.480" offset="217318">This litigation which has extended over a long period of time starting on August 1, 1957, now comes before this Court and the statute involved is the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, which is the successor to the Agricultural Adjustment Act as amended in 1935 following the Schechter and the Panama Oil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.134" offset="379904">Also involved is Order 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.160" offset="399966">Now, Order 27 is an order issued by the Secretary of Agriculture, establishing a marketing area and as it was amended on August 1 or as of August 1, 1957, it includes Metropolitan New York, some upstate areas and 11 North Jersey areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.250" offset="524413">I deem it appropriate this time to outline the facts surrounding these two particular petitioners before I go into the act in detail and the order in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.779" offset="602467">But I might say at the outset that it is in the minds of a lot of people that milk is a very complex situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.572" offset="653667">I -- in my years, pardon the first pronoun, do not find it as complex but this particular situation is not going to be very complex as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.334" offset="716675">The facts that I'm going to recite if the Court please, are facts that were not disputed in the promulgation hearing or in the review hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.278" offset="776443">Now, the review hearing is under Section 15A and it means that we must, if we are to agree, we must go to the administrative agency for relief before we can go the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.522" offset="853452">We did that on the very first day at 9 o'clock when the order became effective, as soon as the door is open and we asked for -- for interim relief, but before the 15A was acted upon or even heard, the Government moved against us in an enforcement proceeding and Judge Corey of the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted the injunction which required us to file reports, but made this exception of we need not pay the money into the administrator or to be distributed among the producers which I'll explain later, but we should pay it into the registry of the Court, that's what we have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.826" offset="1102660">As of July 31 when our briefs were filed, Lehigh Valley had paid into the registry of the Court $617,454 and Suncrest Dairy $108,767.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.650" offset="1185938">Now, how do these petitioners operate and what is their situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.666" offset="1210075">Number one, the Lehigh Valley is a cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.543" offset="1229511">It has 3,400 members, 900 of whom are milk producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.448" offset="1265142">Lehigh Valley accepts all the milk that their producers produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.188" offset="1304116">They sell in fluid form, they manufacture cottage cheese, they manufacture butter and they manufacture ice cream.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.399" offset="1348942">At no time and the record does not dispute it, at no time has Lehigh Valley, since it was organized in 1935, diverted any of its milk into the marketing area of Order 27 except the milk it itself sells in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.009" offset="1467434">Lehigh Valley had been doing business in Philipsburg which is right across the river on Eastern Pennsylvania, Philipsburg, New Jersey a short bridge of less than a half a mile I believe since 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.396" offset="1548936">It built its business there and has been there continuously ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.171" offset="1592090">Lehigh Valley and Suncrest, if the Court please, are not strangers to regulations, nor are we opposed to regulations per se, but we do insist at heart that the statute be followed and the standards be complied with and the chartered course followed, and we do resist discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.736" offset="2046307">I have not raised that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.827" offset="2066683">Philipsburg, New Jersey has been considered by the United States Census Bureau and rightly so as part of the commercial and metropolitan area of Allentown, Bethlehem in Eastern Pennsylvania because we have Allentown, a few miles away from Bethlehem, a few miles away Easton, across the bridge, we have Philipsburg and we've been in there 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.748" offset="2194369">I just want to establish that fact or over 25 years since 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.818" offset="2226657">Suncrest is a company that is organized by combining two or three smaller companies, and it has sold milk in Philipsburg ever since or for the last 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.913" offset="2299068">Now then, how do these two petitioners operate?</text>
            <text syncTime="555.512" offset="2325400">I said they were not strangers to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.489" offset="2345357">The testimony shows this fact that we pay more for fluid milk which is called Class 1 throughout this argument and that we pay more for fluid milk that we sell in Pennsylvania and sell in New Jersey than the Order 27 of Class 1 prices, fixed by the secretary and why do we pay more because the Pennsylvania Milk Control Commission which is in existence as long as the First Agricultural Adjustment Act in 1933 fixes the prices that we pay for that milk even though we sell it out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.031" offset="2575548">In other words, if we bottle the milk in Pennsylvania and sell it out of state, we pay the price they fix which is historically and presently higher than the Class 1 price fixed of Order 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.082" offset="2667708">Milk Control Commission of Pennsylvania is acting under the authority of the Eisenberg case with which this Court is well acquainted, and quoted in the Dumont case, Wood versus Dumont with approval both by the majority and the two minority opinions so that we pay more, I want to fix that.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.964" offset="2787244">We do not divert any of our milk into Order number 27.</text>
