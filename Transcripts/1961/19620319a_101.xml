            <label>Mr. Edwin P. Rome</label>
            <text syncTime="17.432" offset="173119">In submission to Your Honors, this Honorable Court has granted a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.524" offset="217422">That court was composed of Judges Hincks, Waterman and Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.558" offset="237589">Judge Moore wrote the decision below for the majority of the Circuit Court with Judge Hincks writing a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.689" offset="274160">The question for review if Your Honors please is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.644" offset="293909">Did the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action, a private antitrust suit have power to transfer the case under 28 U.S.C. Section 1406 (a) for improper venue without having obtained personal jurisdiction over the transferred defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.195" offset="404146">The facts of the case are simple and are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.303" offset="420551">I would undertake to state them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.704" offset="434239">GoldLawr Incorporated is a Pennsylvania corporation which sued a number of corporate and individual defendants in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the antitrust laws charging that there had been damaged suffered by it as the result of the nationwide monopolization and conspiracy on the part of the defendants, unreasonably to restraints trade in the legitimate theatre industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.582" offset="553671">Trouble damages and injunctive relief were sought by the plaintiff corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.027" offset="575509">The action was instituted in the United States District Court for the Easter District Court of Pennsylvania on October 17, 1956 within one year from the date of entry of a consent decree in the Government's antitrust action against the Shubert's in connection with the legitimate theatre industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.872" offset="662862">The purpose of that institution within that one year was of course to secure the benefits of the tolling statute under Section 5 (b) of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.323" offset="700688">Service on all of the defendants was attempted in Philadelphia and thereafter, service was attempted also on select operating corporation and the United Booking Office Incorporated, two of the corporate respondents here by alias summons issued out of the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.707" offset="790235">Motions were filed to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and improper venue and also to quash the return of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.654" offset="822000">These were filed in November of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.721" offset="838301">The matter came on for argument having been fixed by the Honorable William Kraft in Philadelphia in June of 1957 and was decided on December 22, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.072" offset="891695">At which time, there was a rejection by Judge Kraft of certain motions and a grant of certain other motions on the part of the defendant, respondents who are here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.755" offset="950418">Before there was actually an order entered, there was application made by the plaintiff seeking the transfer of the action to the Southern District of New York and that was granted by Judge Kraft conformably to Section 1406 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="230.694" offset="1026173">There was no specific reference by Judge Kraft to the problem of jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction over the transferred defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.513" offset="1069432">Thereafter in the Southern District of New York, the clerk of that court refused to issue new summonses to the transferred defendants for the reason that there were already returns of service of those summonses as to those defendants from the action in the Easter District Court of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.916" offset="1163055">The individuals who had been transferred, three in number filed answers in New York and the matter continues as to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.898" offset="1199000">But the two corporate defendants select operating company and UBO, United Booking Office renewed their motions to dismiss and thereafter, Judge Palmieri in the Southern District granted their motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.583" offset="1261693">This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.812" offset="1362631">Thereafter, he died and I must admit quite frankly sir, there was no attempt made to substitute his executors or trustees thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.403" offset="1400978">The fact is that insofar as Mr. Heiman or his estate is concern, we as petitioners here do not press any point with regard to the decision made below in -- in his case.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.425" offset="1573073">This, if Your Honor would permit, leads me to address myself to the actual facts of the matter.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin P. Rome</label>
            <text syncTime="373.680" offset="1598046">-- because GoldLawr Incorporated is a Pennsylvania corporation which owns and operates the Erlanger Theatre in the City of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.164" offset="1640051">Its complaint has to do with the fact that effectively, it was denied opportunity to license and present within its theatre legitimate place in Philadelphia for Philadelphia audiences or persons coming to Philadelphia to attend the theatre there.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.247" offset="1704312">The allegation of the complaint is that there was a nationwide monopoly and conspiracy on the part of all the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.971" offset="1735241">In our judgment sir, the essential operative facts of the case have to do with Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.088" offset="1759692">The theatre is located in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.765" offset="1770454">The place that would have been presented for force would have been shown in Philadelphia and the plaintiff made a choice of forum in Philadelphia because they were the main and essential contacts with that forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.069" offset="1823640">But I repeat in response to Your Honor's question, it would have in our judgment and I do not think my friend would dispute this, it would have been possible indeed, he makes much of the fact that it would have been possible to bring the action in New York and service would have been made there.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.956" offset="1887169">The Court of Appeals below that, if the Court please, held in affirming Judge Palmieri's decision that there was not personal jurisdiction obtained over the transferred defendants and hence the transfer of the case was improper and granted the motions to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.628" offset="1969925">It did not so hold because of any feeling that this was more in the interest of justice than would have been the case if the transfer had been sustained nor indeed did it feel that there was any clear cut line of authority in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.474" offset="2033246">Now, I think (Inaudible) would require me to say to Your Honors that there is a -- an anomalous situation within the cases decided on this point.</text>

          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="491.757" stopTime="496.744">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="491.757" offset="2070444">Before you go to the case, don't you think it would be desirable to read the statute and in fact, you read it again?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_p_rome" startTime="496.744" stopTime="667.175">
            <label>Mr. Edwin P. Rome</label>
            <text syncTime="496.744" offset="2090297">Of course sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.213" offset="2100224">The statute involved says the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.671" offset="2114017">The District Court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.768" offset="2202415">There is as that language I think states no reference to whether or not personal jurisdiction should have been secured in the transferor district and indeed, the courts below have recognized that there is no such language.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.632" offset="2285902">The court below, however, has concluded by implication from the Senate report discussing the particular statute at the time of its passage that by implication since there was an example given which seemed to speak in terms of service or personal jurisdiction having been obtained that therefore, personal jurisdiction in the form of service is required as a prerequisite to the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.324" offset="2412648">In our submission, if the Court please, this writ, this conclusion reads into this language a requirement that the specific words do not set forth which Judge Hincks at least below thought was unnecessary and which Judge Parker in the Internatio case in the Fourth Circuit and also which Professor Moore feels to be a less than satisfactory result.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.742" offset="2538350">The court below in the Second Circuit seemingly felt bound by an implication as I as say from the congressional record or perhaps by some feeling of uneasiness that its own earlier decision in 1950 in the Schiller case led to the chain of events which caused other courts including that of the Fourth Circuit to hold that personal service or jurisdiction was not in fact required.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.426" offset="2661125">It attempted to distinguish those other cases by referring to them as admiralty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.164" offset="2692054">And further, it was reasoned that since the specific statute involved 1406 (a) was designed to cure a defect of venue, it ought not to be able to be used to cure a more grievous defect of jurisdiction without specific clear congressional mandate.</text>

            <text syncTime="702.094" offset="2911796">Our action was originally begun as I said in the Philadelphia within one year of the end of the consent decree in the Government's suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.463" offset="2945233">Therefore, we wouldn't have had and did in fact have the benefit of the tolling statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.743" offset="2966340">Now, because transfer is held to be improper, to the extent we institute another action against these defendants in the -- in the Southern District of New York, we are not able to take the case back to 1950 and hence we'll suffer irreparable harm because a great many of the operative facts which we rely upon just establishing the monopolization and the conspiracy occurred in that earlier period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.396" offset="5880978">In ultimate essence, this case represents therefore perhaps another aspect or another side of the coin which Your Honors have had before you in Hoffman versus Blaski and the Continental Grain case because in those instances, defendants were seeking to affect transfer to jurisdictions where the action might not initially have been brought against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.261" offset="5996440">Here, we have a plaintiff under 1406 (a) seeking to affect a transfer in the interest of justice to a jurisdiction where indisputably, the action might originally have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.571" offset="6057671">And yet here, under the ruling of the law, the plaintiff has denied the opportunity or right to do that although the judge in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania felt that it was in conformity with 1406 (a) to permit it and both majority and dissenting opinion below would seem to be in one view as to the propriety of it from the point of view of affecting ultimate justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.341" offset="6180760">The view with deference to the court below of the majority would seem to turn upon therefore a more narrowly limited construction of 1406 than the very words of the statute would require and has the net result of doing substantial damage, harm to the petitioner here because as I have stated, it cuts off a very considerable measure of the damage period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.716" offset="6298206">We think that the statute as drawn on its very faith insofar as the plain words are concerned would permit the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.944" offset="6343137">We think that there was nothing in the congressional record or report having to do with the passage of the legislation that would preclude it the result of sustaining the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.866" offset="6386813">Indeed, the one illustration given in the Senate report that represents an element of caution where the illustrations spoke in terms of a situation in which jurisdiction had been obtained in the transferor court is indeed answered by Your Honors' decision in the Hoffman versus Blaski.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.773" offset="6470510">And hence, that fear no longer would seem to be well-founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.891" offset="6486915">And finally, it would seem that the result here does prevent the plaintiff without an opportunity to have his day in court on the merits being precluded unnecessarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="2234.296" offset="9040541">We seem to have avoided this statute and the question is not really what ought to have been done or might have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.729" offset="9070320">But what did Congress do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.054" offset="9079620">And we must remember that whether it was good or bad prior to 1948, federal courts had no such power to transfer back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.394" offset="9120998">In 1948, the statute was first passed and it was mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.765" offset="9142418">If under 1406 the venue is brought in the wrong place, the court has got to transfer it to a place where the suit might have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.971" offset="9183274">And the very next year, Congress realized the difficulty there because then the surest way of getting jurisdiction into the federal court was to bring it as far from home base as you could and leave it to the court to find out where it ought too have been brought and sent it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.058" offset="9251610">And the very next year, Congress gave the District Court the right to determine whether that should be done or not in the interest of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.659" offset="9285987">So now, if you bring a suit in the wrong district, you run the risk that the court may say that's not fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.129" offset="9311901">Judge Hincks pointed out that that is not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.646" offset="9333948">It must also be recognized that the only question here is the simple ones they did in the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.354" offset="9364773">May a court which has no jurisdiction over the parties where service has never been made, transfer under Section 1406 to some of their district where the suit might have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.740" offset="9422346">Now, when Judge Kraft signed this order, I have the difficult decision of what to do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.775" offset="9458500">This transfer order affected only some of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.345" offset="9480756">And if Your Honors will remember Section 54 (b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, the interlocutory appeal section, it is provided there that you may appeal if the court permits you whether it has been a decision on some but less than all of the causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.042" offset="9555571">A great many cases arose and I think none of them reached this Court but all of them decided that a decision as to some but less than all of the parties is not the equivalent of a decision on some but less than all of the causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.378" offset="9620877">That therefore, barred me from an appeal in the -- in the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.356" offset="9644805">So when case was transferred, I followed it through and move to dismiss in that court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2497.549" offset="10093589">This suit was started on October 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.365" offset="10116786">Mr. Rome was not counsel then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.318" offset="10124622">The counsel at that time withdrew after about four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.918" offset="10147088">The complaint asked for four years of damages, quite obviously overlooking the suspension statute that has been referred to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.112" offset="10195780">I filed a motion to dismiss on a lot of grounds, lack of service and jurisdiction and also under the ground of the statute of limitations because even on the plaintiffs interpretation of the statute that had the wrong period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.194" offset="10260146">And being fearful of the rule that you may file one motion and you must include it in all your reasons, I feared that if I didn't mention the statute of limitations, I might be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.876" offset="10314898">That must have alerted the plaintiff because very -- in February the following year, it filed a motion to amend carrying its period of limitations, its damages, back a couple of years earlier which it might have done in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.222" offset="10380309">The point I mentioned is that being alerted during that period of five or six months up until February 17th, 1957, the plaintiff could have started a cautionary action in New York where my clients could readily have been served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.240" offset="10444361">Mr. Shubert's are indigenous to New York and Mr. Shubert occupied the same office for 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.163" offset="10464005">There is no question of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.511" offset="10477380">But the plaintiff didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.843" offset="10486784">Until August 1959, almost three years later when it got around the filing of cautionary action in New York which is beyond my power to attack, I mentioned all of this because if there is any hardship in this case because of the statute of limitations, it's the plaintiff's own doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.105" offset="10559822">It was alerted by my motions in plenty of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.832" offset="10574660">In fact, one of my objects was to get this litigation to New York because that's where the Shuberts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.928" offset="10599111">And any conspiracy alleged to keep shows away from this Erlanger Theatre must have transpired in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.826" offset="10626696">That's where the producers are and I think I needn't argue with that where its shows originate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.042" offset="13015542">Now, if you look at the (b) Section of 1404, there's a very curious circumstance there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.867" offset="13166843">It provided for that in Section 1404.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.939" offset="13183143">We are asked to assume that it meant the same thing when it wrote 1406 but didn't say it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.521" offset="13233507">Then Judge Moore in his majority opinion points out here that these sections are under the heading in the Judicial Code, Section Chapter 87 entitled Venue, venue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3688.397" offset="14856965">When I went to the Second Circuit, we had a different array of judges but they're quite closely, and they must have discussed it because they all agree, five of them sat on this thing eventually and agreed that they had not considered that question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.039" offset="14919555">They transferred it because everybody but the plaintiff agreed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.256" offset="14936377">And Judge Dimock came along a little bit later and worked in another case in the District Court in New York, Southern District, where there had been no service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.663" offset="14982040">He permitted a transfer but he expressly stated he had a good deal of misgivings but he felt he was bound by the Schiller case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.534" offset="15021537">Then the District Circuit and the Fourth Circuit followed and all of these cases either cite the Schiller case as authority or they cite a case which itself depends in its antecedents on the Schiller case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.667" offset="15086007">And if you read that, if Your Honor please it did not so hold, the Second Court readily agreed the Second Circuit that it did not so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.616" offset="15121847">So there is not an imposing array of difference of opinion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.348" offset="15140760">It's true that the District and the Second and the Fourth Circuit use words of approval but they always cite for it at this case, which does not in -- in all fairness so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.869" offset="15198856">Now, I think that that is the -- the essence of my argument, if Your Honor please, insufficient for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.213" offset="15244204">I think I neglected to state that I represent the two corporate defendants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.061" offset="15263640">And Mr. Lipper represents the estate of Marcus Heiman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.423" offset="15277014">I should have started that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3825.961" offset="15407208">I would just ask leave to bring to Your Honors attention the fact that Mr. Phillips said inverted in passing to the conclusion of the court below in the majority opinion about the use of the language and the actual placing of the words of 1406 as being indicative that it was intended only to cure a venue defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.424" offset="15525073">Actually however, no inference of course of legislative construction as to be drawn from the placing of the statute or the title headings of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.876" offset="15558928">The other point that I would ask leave to mention is that regardless of what one may say concerning the subsequent analysis by the Second Circuit of its decision in Schiller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.181" offset="15612113">It remains true that the Second Circuit did in fact sustained a transfer of a case where there had not been jurisdiction in the transferor court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.384" offset="15664880">And finally that Judge Parker, even though this was an admiralty case in the Internatio in the Fourth Circuit rest his conclusions squarely on the language and the purpose of 1406.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.859" offset="15730813">Thank you, sir.</text>
