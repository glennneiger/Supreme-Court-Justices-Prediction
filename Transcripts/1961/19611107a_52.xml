            <text syncTime="18.565" offset="177612">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.913" offset="199032">This is a contest between a mortgage in a federal tax lien for priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.557" offset="245635">Under statute, under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which I hope to discuss in more detail later on my argument, a federal tax lien in order to be valid as against the mortgage and several other classifications against the mortgagee and several other classifications must be filed in either one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.514" offset="381471">In a state office where -- which has been established in accordance with the laws of the state or authorized by the laws of the state or if the state has not authorized such an office in the office of the clerk of the District Court, the issue in brief here is whether a state has authorized such an office when it requires that the notice of lien describe particular parcels of real property in order that it may accept notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.728" offset="586271">The State of Michigan did prescribe under its law that any notice of lien filed in the office authorized by it must state -- must describe the real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.522" offset="669445">And since this was not considered as permitting a notice of tax lien to be filed in the form and with the efficacy of a full notice of tax lien that was filed in the office of the clerk of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.045" offset="759515">The facts are -- which are not in dispute are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.429" offset="789086">In January 1954, federal income taxes were assessed against Robert and Helen Peters in the amount of some $1300 and notice and demand for payment was sent to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.811" offset="874663">In July 1954, a notice of tax lien was filed by the Government in the clerk's office of the United States District Court, Eastern District of Washington, the notice did not contained a description of any real property owned by the tax payers.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.075" offset="975705">At that time, the statute of the State of Michigan, statute which had been in this form from the 1920's on required that to set up of certain offices for the filing of federal liens but required that the property be described before the -- in such a notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.345" offset="1096704">In 5th -- 1953, the year before these events took place, the Attorney General of Michigan had ruled that the registers -- County Registers in Michigan could not accept notices of tax lien unless they did contained such a description.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.166" offset="1207986">In view of the fact that the county register would not accept the notice, the -- and since it was felt that this was an unwarranted condition limiting the federal tax lien, the District Director filed a notice in the clerk -- office of the clerk of the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.979" offset="1311326">Subsequent to this July when the note 54 when the notice was filed, the insurance company respondent here gave a mortgage, loan money and gave a more -- and received the mortgage from the Peters on property which say they then owned in Oakland County.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.811" offset="1434624">Subsequently, this was done in November 1954, subsequently the Peters defaulted on the payments on the mortgage, the present action, the action before the Court here which was one of foreclosure the mortgage was brought in the Michigan State Court and the United States was joined as a party both the trial court and the Michigan Supreme Court held that the Government had not filed an adequate notice because it had been filed in the office of the clerk of the District Court and asserting that the state had provided an office.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.238" offset="1660322">The Michigan Supreme Court further considered two decisions, one, by the Sixth Circuit in the Youngblood case which held that it was proper for Michigan to require that the real property be described, and the other a decision of the Ninth -- of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in Rasmuson case which held to the contrary supporting on the Government's view point.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.561" offset="1825625">The Supreme Court of Michigan noted that this Court had not spoken on the subject and decided to follow the Youngblood case.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.865" offset="1886856">The nature of the federal tax lien is that it attaches upon notice and demand and assessment of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.278" offset="1944534">And that, it applies to all property then owned by a tax payer or after acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.659" offset="1982046">If in order to file notices of tax lien in the state or any other office, the district directors would have to describe the property to which a notice attached, it would be necessary to have some officer of the Government either continuously search the various registers offices to determine whether a tax payer has acquired owned property at the time the notice was filed and in particular whether he acquired property later.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.091" offset="2175770">This would effect we believe, very seriously the efficacy of the federal tax lien as created by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.528" offset="2213491">We think this is an unreasonable and improper condition to the designation of an office and under these circumstances, a state has an effect not designated any office at all and therefore the Government is entitled to file its lien in the office of the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.944" offset="2319130">Now, the legislative history of the federal tax lien, we believe strongly supports this argument in this view point.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.319" offset="2372629">The federal tax lien in almost its present form was first established in around 1867, but at that time there was no provision at all for the filing of notices of lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.705" offset="2446190">In -- it became Section 3186 of the revised statutes in 1875 and then 1893, a case came to this Court construing that provision of the revised statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.382" offset="2532916">The -- under the facts of that case which is United States against Snyder, a taxpayer had sold real property to a bona fide purchaser but this Court held that nevertheless, the purchaser took -- subject to the tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.527" offset="2645452">In 1913, the first provision for notice -- filing of notices of tax lien was incorporated into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.415" offset="2725073">That provision required that the notice be filed in the office of the clerk of the District Court and further provided that if a state authorized a place in a county for the filing of notices of tax lien, the notice should also be filed in the state office.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.741" offset="2846386">In 1928, the revised statute section was further amended and it then provided that the notice would not be valid as against the mortgagee, purchaser, and judgment creditor unless a notice was filed in one of two places.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.515" offset="2977416">In a state office, in accordance with the laws of the state, or if the state had not provided such an office, in an office of the United States District Court, while that statute -- while the statute in that form was in effect, namely, when the words were in accordance with the laws of a state, a case arose in the Sixth Circuit, Western District of Michigan construing the very statute that we have before us which requires that the notice of lien include a description of the real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.424" offset="3181066">The case went to the Sixth Circuit which affirmed the decision of the District Court against the Government on -- for the reason stated in the opinion of the District Court, that's United States against Maniaci.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.020" offset="3267480">What the Court emphasized was that the statute as it then read said that the state office was to be instituted in accordance with the laws of a state and therefore the Court reasoned that since the state might by law make certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.446" offset="3381164">Within a few year -- two years after the affirmance by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit of the Maniaci case, Congress then changed the law -- amended the law again to read as it does in the governing provisions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.804" offset="3498611">It changed the language from in accordance with the laws of the state to and -- ought -- as authorized by the laws of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.517" offset="3541452">And in so doing, the Committee reports indicate quite clearly that it was the purpose to obviate, to overrule legislatively that station of the Sixth Circuit, and to prevent state offices from doing any more than designate state -- the states from doing anymore than designating offices and to denying to states the rights of setting any conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.606" offset="3701844">I'd like to read what the Committee -- the Senate Committee reports said, it's on page 16 of our brief, that Treasury Department has consistently taken the position that Section 3672 of the Code, that's the 1939 Code, the revised statute provision have been renumbered that way, and the corresponding provisions of prior law authorized the state or territory only to designate the local office for the filing of the notice of lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.047" offset="3863594">This section of the bill which clarify Section 3672 (a) as amended is merely declaratory of the existing procedure and in accordance with the long continued practice of the Treasury Department which has been questioned in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.246" offset="3952306">And I think in the -- if I may add that Mr. Justice in the Rasmuson case, the Eighth Circuit construed this change made in 1942 to be intended to overrule the Maniaci case and I think --</text>

            <label>Mr. I. Henry Kutz</label>
            <text syncTime="999.984" offset="4103293">I don't think there are any other Court of Appeals cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.538" offset="4117504">It -- one of the few cases, the -- now, after -- after the amendment, the Ninth -- of 1942, the question the again came up in the Six Circuit in the case called Youngblood against United States which is one of the cases -- which is the case that the court below followed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.354" offset="4288763">In that case, the United States attempted to mandamus a registrar of a county in Michigan to compel him to accept the notice of lien under the amended 1942 Act without a description of the real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.337" offset="4396701">And the Government prevailed in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.891" offset="4414986">The upper court, that is the Sixth Circuit reversed, and its holding, we believe, was principally that mandamus were of a state ministerial officer who was merely trying to carry out this -- the provision to the statue of his own state was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.099" offset="4515819">And that's all as we think the case actually holds, the rest is dictum, but in that dictum which is dictum that the Supreme Court of Michigan quoted here, the Sixth Circuit stated that in its opinion the 1942 amendment did not change the situation as it had existed before, in other words the change from -- in accordance with a lot -- in office establish in accordance with the law of the state was, in its view, equivalent to statement that the -- the provision in 1942 Act that the notices must be filed in offices authorized by the laws of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.860" offset="4758862">Subsequently, in the Eighth Circuit in United States against Rasmuson, the question arose under Minnesota law, and there, it arose in connection with property which had been registered under the Torrens System, which is optional in that's state and which also exists in about a dozen states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.436" offset="4905148">The -- it was claimed that the filing by the Government was ineffectual because it wasn't filed as against the very property that was registered under the Torrens Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.542" offset="4997517">In other words, it had to file as against this particular parcel which is substantially the same as requiring a description in a notice of lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.419" offset="5057076">The lower court ruled against the Government, but the Eighth Circuit held that there was a change in the meaning of the law by the 1942 Act, that these states offices are authorized by Congress which it -- for the convenience of citizens of the state, the state may take advantage to them as it wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.734" offset="5186330">But it cannot require any conditions to be put upon the lien which are not inherit to the lien, that in effect all that it can do is designate the office in which the notice of lien shall be filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.199" offset="7024201">I think the important thing that we should keep in mind in considering this case is, first of all, that we undoubtedly must recognize that we're living in a commercial society within this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.516" offset="7077386">And this Court has also recognized that the plenary powers of Congress particularly in the taxing field must sometimes give way so as to maintain that fluidity of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.395" offset="7136946">For example if you want to take the history of this particular situation prior to the 1913 Amendment Congress had said apparently that these liens could be filed without reference to any kind of notice and many persons suffered as a result of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.181" offset="7204133">Congress recognized in this problem in 1913 amended the statute to provide for notice so as to provide some protection to commerce and to people that they -- so that they could deal freely with property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.300" offset="7260557">Now, that's an overlying principle and I think that this Court has very wisely recognized that where you're going to impinge upon the fluidity of this commerce, there must be good and compelling reasons to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.709" offset="7318235">And if we apply those principles to this case, and if we also recognize that this plenary power to interfere with the fluidity of commerce through these ill-noticed liens should be curtailed or at lease should only be allowed to the extent Congress grants it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.786" offset="7386467">But I think you'll agree with us that this case should affirm the decision of the Michigan Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2777.042" offset="11211525">Now, the Youngblood case was a clear declaration that under the very law involved in this particular case and Youngblood became the law, I believe not only the Circuit, but the law of most Circuits at that time, in 1944, that was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.229" offset="11280280">It was a clear declaration to the effect that after all if a lien was to be asserted against real property, that lien should be recorded as the statute gave the right with the register of deeds of the county where the land was situated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2819.636" offset="11381948">I'm prejudiced because it holds with me, but I also believe that it's a well-reasoned opinion and properly approaches the whole problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.183" offset="11416116">Youngblood also discussed mandamus, that was the other phase of it, but it would be equally appropriate since both subject were discussed to say that the mandamus phase of it was dictum and that the discussion about the relevancy of the 44 statute was germane to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.156" offset="11484035">I won't burden the Court with a host of citations about dictum, they were not raised in the brief of the United States, so we didn't bother to answer them, although in the brief before the Michigan Supreme Court they were raised, and our brief in reply to the Michigan Supreme Court brief contains those citations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.983" offset="11543280">Now, in the few moments that I have remaining, I would like to just point out to the Court the reason why we believe that Youngblood is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.008" offset="11591450">Please, may the Court bear in mind, that this is a question not of the power of Congress, but of the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.396" offset="11624991">We're dealing with these statutes in 1942-1944 and earlier, did Congress intend that the state could protect the muniments of its titles by requiring that the collector, like everyone else, if he wants to file a lien, should do so by properly describing the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.507" offset="11697403">We say clear it was intended to be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.424" offset="11713076">Now, going back, the United States first brought this problem up in the case of U.S. versus Maniaci which is referred to in our brief and goes back to about 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.902" offset="11766993">And I had the interesting experience of reading that case again this morning before I came down and it sounds as though the Government, the same learned counsel, the Government was arguing in Maniaci at that time, because in 36 F.Supp., the argument of the Government was set forth in this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.861" offset="11842853">The Government urges that the purpose of the amendment of 1928 was solely to leave to the states the power to designate by law the place of filing of notice of lien, that a law requiring a notice to set forth a description of the property is beyond the power of the state legislature and that subject provisions neither authorize nor approved by the Act of 1928, if we substitute the words 1942 for 1928, we virtually epitomize the whole position of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.266" offset="11960404">And the Sixth Circuit in Maniaci struck that down and refused to by -- abide by it and said that the laws of Michigan very properly state that the lien must contain a description.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.462" offset="12009200">And then, the Act was amended in 1942 and the Government again came back and said we're confronted with these hardships, and they argued in Youngblood, there should be no requirement that the lien be recorded with the register of deeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.984" offset="12071267">And the Sixth Circuit again in Youngblood took cognizant of all of these arguments and again said unless Congress clearly states what it intends to do, we must rely upon the statute as it reads and that statute does not require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.918" offset="12127065">Now, it's interesting to note these gyrations made in amending the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.306" offset="12156635">From 1913 unto 1928, which became the 1939 provision of the Code, that was the old Act, the law stated that the lien would be valid, it must be valid to be valid -- it must be filed in the register of deeds when any state by appropriate legislation authorizes the filing of such notice in the office of the register of deeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.774" offset="12278471">That's the way the law stood, and in 1928, that was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.552" offset="12305533">And 28 Act which became part of the 39 Code, struck out that language and said that the lien to be valid must be filed in accordance with the law of the state or territory -- accordance with the law of the state or territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.420" offset="12385050">Now, Solicitor General is here today arguing, in accordance with the law of the state or territory concededly means that Maniaci was probably right and that the state could say the lien must have a description.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.227" offset="12452237">And yet before Maniaci, this opposite position was taken and it was said this changed the law and that it was no longer necessary that the state require a levy -- the levy to contain a description because the 1913 Act required it, and now it's changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.560" offset="12537605">In other words, the Government since 1913 has been saying congressional changes mean just exactly that we no longer have to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.288" offset="12572505">But the most significant telling part of this whole thing, it seems to me is this, in 1944 before Youngblood, the Government again came in and said, the statute has been amended again in accordance with the law has been deleted and both statute now reads in the office in which the filing of such notice is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.425" offset="12661112">Therefore, the state can no longer set forth the requirements for filing that only is given a place, and that's the argument, and they say Youngblood is wrong because Youngblood didn't go along with this on that and recognizes clear declaration of Congress but --</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.012" offset="12731434">I have been practicing law long enough, sir, to realize, Mr. Justice Harlan, that it's pretty difficult to determine what Congress sometimes intends when you see the ultimate product that congressional action come up and become a part of the statute books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.950" offset="12799143">I don't think it means anymore than it did in 1913 when they changed the Act and went back to what vir -- and passed what is now virtually the 1944 Act, because in 1913 the statute read, authorized the filing of such notice and the office of the registrar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.793" offset="12866539">In other words, the state statute authorizes the filing, they talked of filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.887" offset="12882944">Then in 1928, or which became part of the 1939 Code, they struck that and they said in accordance with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.789" offset="12910529">And then in 1944, which is supposed to be the one that we're confronted with now which changed all this, they go right back and virtually reenact the 1913 statute which says, in the office and which the filing of such notice is authorized by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.452" offset="12981164">So we've gone through almost the complete cycle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.789" offset="12994539">And most importantly, I would adopt in a sense the argument of the Solicitor in stating congressional direction is manifested by the 1955 Act, because in 1955 when Congress finally want to make it clear, it had no trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.368" offset="13064861">And interestingly enough, Mr. Justice Harlan, when it didn't make the amendment, it did not go back and amend Section 6 -- 3672 which have been the troublesome one, talking about in the office were authorized or in the office designated, but it added the whole new section and didn't changed 3672 very much and added a new subsection (b) to the effect you can file this lien no matter what the state court provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.099" offset="13167783">In summation, I should simply like to restate my argument this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.711" offset="13182203">This problem since 1955, no longer exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.120" offset="13199862">The director is not confronted with these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.093" offset="13207698">So you were asked not to go back six years and decide that law which arose prior to 1955 should be changed despite the fact that Youngblood was on the books and continued on the books when this mortgage was given and continued on the books until changed by congressional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.129" offset="13275930">Maniaci was in the Circuit, our own Attorney General had made declarations and we had decisions from our courts and you're asked to change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.546" offset="13313546">Now, think for a moment of Brosnan and the mischief and the habit that may very well -- may very well-resulted as it affects the marketabilities of title and why it should be done, I do not know, because the problem since 1955 complained about by the director no longer exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.865" offset="13390869">So I would suggest to this Court that all of the arguments now made maybe interesting from the academic standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.971" offset="13419290">Since 1955, the problem hasn't existed and there is no reason to strike back and re-determine Youngblood which in effect is what you're asked to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.751" offset="13466415">Youngblood was never appealed from in 1942 or 1944 by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.768" offset="13490448">If it created all this (Inaudible) from 1944 and presage the devastation of Government liens which is now proclaimed, why was it not appealed from and why do we come to this Court now in 1961?</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.996" offset="13539349">I believe that muniments of title of Michigan should not thus be disturbed particularly in view that since 1955, the problem hasn't existed for the Government.</text>
