            <text syncTime="1661.284" offset="6748557">Very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.697" offset="6758170">Well, as I have said to the Court previously, they are saying that we are complaining about here is that the court passed these rules and disqualified or put Mr. Martin in a classification that we think is not real nor not warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.445" offset="6857122">And what I have said about Mr. Martin would go to those other attorneys if I may speak briefly upon classification in the little time that I have left here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.102" offset="6923786">I think this Court has said many times that you cannot have a wholly arbitrary standard or a consideration that offends the dictates of reason and that there must be some rational connection with a person's fitness and capacity to practice law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.289" offset="7032560">Now, weighing these rules in the light of those general statements that has governed this Court in other decisions, surely it cannot be said that after all of the years of practice that Mr. Martin either had the privilege or the right to indulge in, and I'm not so concerned about that, surely can it be said that now simply because Mr. Martin continuing in the same method and mode that he followed previously also engages in the practice of law in the state of Missouri has now become incapacitated, incompetent, or not qualified to practice law in Kansas without being associated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.640" offset="7273932">And having associated with him a local lawyer with all of the incidents of pay or economics or whatever may be concerned with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.575" offset="7341641">We think that any classification, Mr. Martin upon that score is an unreal thing and of course, it not only offends the dictates of reason but it is an unsubstantial and not a logical classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.691" offset="7438085">To say that here is a Kansas lawyer with all of the requirements of even being a local lawyer that is as to admission of the Bar, residency, and maintenance of an office, and to say now, he's different, he is different, and he has counsel in this case and I practice only in Johnson County, except occasionally, that he is different now than his counsel merely because he goes two or three miles over into the State of Missouri, where his office is located in Kansas goes over two or three miles into the State of Missouri and practices law over there.</text>
