            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="84.052" offset="439568">Yes, sir, that's all we urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.242" offset="456391">We urged yesterday that the test to be applied should be formulated in terms of the objectives of economic regulation of motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.405" offset="492962">That one of the principal objectives was to encourage the development of a sound public transportation system by restricting, with exceptions, for higher transportation to authorized carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.853" offset="546774">At the same time, the Act permits genuine private carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.145" offset="563911">In realization of the fact that in some circumstances for some shippers, a private carriage provides genuine economies or other advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.163" offset="608005">But normally, we think of private carriage as the situation where the shipper obtains separately the elements of transportation, the equipment, labor, fuel, and so on and by his own management and judgment puts them together into a transportation facility for the transportation of his own goods and at the same time, there are risks, inherent risks and disadvantages in genuine private carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.516" offset="721481">There's the investment and equipment either by way of purchase or by lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.424" offset="741021">There's the problem of supervision of drivers scattered all over the country, the point at which Oklahoma encountered difficulty in its earlier operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.534" offset="781458">And there is the problem of getting a balanced movement, inbound and outbound and above all, there's the risk of non-utilization of equipment depending upon the fluctuations in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.432" offset="829106">But as long as the shipper is willing to assume those risks and burdens, then his private carrier operations present no problem under the Interstate Commerce Act, because natural economic forces will limit the extent to which private carriage diverts traffic from the public transportation industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.126" offset="915832">It's when we get into variations from what is clearly an admittedly private carriage that we need some kind of a realistic test.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.614" offset="953866">And we find that test suggested in this Court's decision in Silk v. United States in 331 U.S., in which this Court held that owner-operators and the facts of that case were not employees for the purposes of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.641" offset="1021889">Now, of course that status of employee isn't necessarily the same for statute with different purposes, but we think Your Honors did suggest what the approach should be.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.801" offset="1318536">The alternative test, we think, is of more generalized applicability who -- looking in the allocation of risks and costs and you can tell that by and large from un -- the undisputed contractual arrangements between the parties, who is taking the risks of performing a transportation service?</text>
            <text syncTime="323.945" offset="1399202">Is the shipper taking those risks, or is the shipper buying transportation on a unit on a per mile basis at a predetermined cost to him?</text>

            <text syncTime="502.791" offset="2114539">No one is controlling nor is the list complete,” in other words, if we're to look at the total situation, including the risk undertaken and who is undertaking the risk to find the economic reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.923" offset="2171068">Now, turning to these arrangements here, under these contractual arrangements, Oklahoma -- between Oklahoma and the owner-operators, each owner-operator provides a tractor which he drives himself except in unusual circumstances for both the use of his vehicle and for his services as driver.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.711" offset="2334177">Now the separate leasing and collective bargaining agreements seemed to say that the owner-operators are separately selling their services and the use of their equipment, but the under like -- underlying reality is brought out by two contracts in this record.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.313" offset="3968606">The most of the factors on which Oklahoma has relied at one time or another to indicate that this is true private carriage, our factors which are equally applicable to -- and admitted even to a typical contract carrier operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.076" offset="4031718">For example that Oklahoma determines when and where the vehicles go and determines the order of loading.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.660" offset="4058049">That's the characteristic of the contract carriage in which a contract carrier in terms of the statute, statutory definitions dedicates equipment to the exclusive use of a shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.428" offset="4105070">Now, the provision that in the equipment leases that Oklahoma shall have exclusive use of the equipment is a common aspect of legal contract carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.179" offset="4152090">The fact that Oklahoma assumes responsibility for seeing that there's compliance with ICC safety regulations simply begs the question, because those obligations, those safety obligations are imposed upon whoever is in fact engaged in transportation either as a contract carrier or as a private carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.364" offset="4232861">The fact that Oklahoma retains responsibility for cargo loses doesn't prove anything because neither the Interstate Commerce Act nor the ICC regulations require a contract carrier to assume responsibility for cargo losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.951" offset="4299212">Finally, they continue to suggest that it's significant that they retain the right to hire and fire the owner-operators as drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.845" offset="4334738">By which I take it, they mean, that they can hire and fire them and still continue to use the tractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.455" offset="4357204">Well, that -- that just doesn't stand up because the lease agreement covering the tractors is terminable upon 30 days notice by either party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.106" offset="4395760">And in addition, since under that lease agreement, Oklahoma doesn't obligate itself to give any owner-operator as much as one pound of freight.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.060" offset="6323597">The two significant elements in highway transportation are the vehicle and the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.221" offset="6364244">And I think that in any consideration of the problem here, we must constantly keep that in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.504" offset="6401337">The control test, so-called which the Court examined, was one way in which the Commission looked at the facts before it, but our quarrel with the Court is that it relied wholly upon the control test and did not look at the second test or the second body of facts or situations which was before the Commission, namely, what has been called the risk of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.140" offset="6519933">And regardless of what maybe the result of applying the control test, we think that in this particular situation, the risk of doing business test is finally the more important in determining the status of these owner-operators here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.924" offset="6591091">And we think that the Commission really relied upon that evaluation and we think it is the important evaluation to be borne in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.506" offset="6845419">We think that there are in this connection some significant facts that ought again to be emphasized, one, the lessee, Oklahoma Furniture had imposed upon it no promise, no obligation to use these owner-operators a particular mile, nor to give them a particular volume or tonnage of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.921" offset="6931101">It was absolutely none guaranteed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.689" offset="6942177">A further consideration is that there was given to certain employees who drove the owned vehicles of Oklahoma Furniture Company, a guarantee of six hours pay per work -- per work day, but there was no such guarantee through the owner-operators so that if the regular employees report, they get a six-hour pay compensation, but if the owner-operators report and don't do any work, they won't get anything at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.756" offset="7074356">That goes it seems to me, to constitute a very important fact in showing that the real risk of doing business here is upon these owner-operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.740" offset="7118346">Now, within the objectives of the National Transportation Policy, the conference which I represent has a tremendous stake in this case as was pointed out by Mr. Ginnane yesterday when he talked about the economic aspects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.181" offset="7180100">Those objectives in this policy are the developing, the coordinating and the preserving of a national transportation system adequate for the needs of commerce and the defense of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.799" offset="7226598">Our carriers, our general commodity carriers are a part of that system, and that policy indicates clearly that the Commission should seek to develop say adequate and economically sound transportation companies as parts of this system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.413" offset="7293053">It is our view that the decision of the court below threatens the achievement of these objectives of the National Transportation Policy by endangering the traffic which our people normally might get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.852" offset="7346761">From the very fact that whether the intervener is here, supports our view in this regard because they too have desirable traffic which if this type of arrangement is proper can be channeled away from the regulated carrier whether it's common contract or for that matter whether it is the common carrier railroad system of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.380" offset="7432861">This effort, we think, is merely symptomatic of a problem in several cases cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.087" offset="7463685">If you would take a look at the Stickle case which is in the Tenth Circuit Court, you will find that a lumber, an important commodity, is there involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.054" offset="7503600">In Pickard, which came from the Western District of New York, we'll find that furniture is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.860" offset="7530768">In the Lamb case which again came from the Tenth Circuit, we will find that wheat was moved by a somewhat similar device in one direction and groceries in the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.214" offset="7576221">In the La Tuff case, we will find that air cooling equipment was moved and also furnace fittings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.860" offset="7614777">We're really talking here about very significant and important traffic, so that what is to be preserved in promoting this national transportation system is tremendously important in terms of economics and traffic.</text>

            <text syncTime="2121.575" offset="8589667">Well, the real -- the real question here, Your Honors, as we see it is whether the transportation conducted -- as conducted is transportation for hire or private transportation and an important consideration here as is seen by the Court in the Le Tuff case mentioned in our brief pages 18 and thereafter, that is a decision of the District Court in Minnesota, is I think quite relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.056" offset="8711607">The Court there said, where one's object in the transportation of property on public highways is to earn compensation for the use of his equipment and his services, he cannot evade regulation by execution of the lease -- of leases or other agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.506" offset="8769390">And we think that that principle is applicable here as it's also applicable as stated by the Court in the B &amp; C Truck Leasing case which comes from the Tenth Circuit, it's a 1960 decision and which we rely upon in our brief, and which says that where -- well, first of all that the Act is highly remedial in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.377" offset="8848906">And that it should be liberally construed, and that its terms are sufficiently broad to reach all those who are in substance engaged in the business of transportation and it is our assertion here that these carriers, these owner-operators by furnishing both the vehicle and the driver service are engaged in the substance of transportation and we think that the decision of the Court in that case is right in holding when those two are put together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.173" offset="8968025">As they say, when the acts of all are linked together as integrated parts of procedure through which property is transported interstate commerce such acts themselves become unlawful.</text>

            <label>Mr. William L. Peterson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2240.228" offset="9064260">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.346" offset="9076799">There are several material facts that I don't feel have been brought out and I'd like to do so at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.918" offset="9103026">First of all, Oklahoma Furniture Manufacturing Company manufactures low cost furniture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.960" offset="9131238">It is the cheapest furniture that can be purchased in the industry and that type of business, that type of manufacturing is extremely competitive, the most competitive of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.558" offset="9189648">Now, Oklahoma charges for this furniture based on a zonal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.671" offset="9218069">And the -- the zonal base or the zonal price for the furniture is not dependent upon the distance of the place of sale from Guthrie, Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.238" offset="9260283">That's dependent more upon the competition within the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.124" offset="9283897">Now, Oklahoma has always tried to be and we feel it has always been a private carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.299" offset="9312528">The reasons that it has been a private carrier because this is light bulky cargo, hauling furniture and it's undesirable from a for-hire carriage standpoint and there is only one carrier, the record reflects that there is only one carrier which hauls from Guthrie uncrated furniture and this carrier goes only west.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.753" offset="9410435">Now, the reason that the crating is extremely important is that this is inexpensive furniture and the cost of crating remains the same, so therefore the cost of crating furniture, if Oklahoma had the haul crated, would make it extremely high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.821" offset="9498624">In 1952 when this lease arrangement was changed over, the company -- and the company counsel submitted the lease agreement to the Interstate Commerce Commission representative in Oklahoma City and he made suggestions to the lease arrangements which were complied with, and then that lease arrangement was put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.945" offset="9583156">After Arkansas declared in the action which has been mentioned that these drivers were contract carriers within Arkansas, Oklahoma Furniture through its Vice President, Mr. Walker, and the company counsel again went to Fort Worth this time to talk with the Interstate Commerce Commission representatives there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.327" offset="9676675">And the record shows that at that time, it was suggested that this arrangement was wrong because Oklahoma Furniture didn't have control and that these people weren't drivers or weren't employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.659" offset="9741981">And therefore, the present lease arrangements were drawn in our effort to make these men employees of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.313" offset="9784613">Now, under this -- under this lease agreement, Oklahoma obtains the complete right to use that truck, and it has a right to hire and fire the drivers independently of the lease agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.783" offset="9842500">Under the union contract, of course, these men aren't treated as employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.318" offset="9864652">After this, the change in the operation was substantial really because Oklahoma provided -- after that provided workmen's compensation, social security, it gave these drivers vacation benefits and military service benefits and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.019" offset="9951483">And therefore, we feel that these men have been made employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.414" offset="10004982">If it please the Court, I'd like to now talk just a little bit about this aspect of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.246" offset="10032358">Mr. Ginnane stated that he was making no issue as to this control but you'll find on page 17 of their brief in Footnote 8, where it states in this appeal, we do not challenge the District Court's conclusion that the evidence did not want a finding that Oklahoma lack control of the details of the operation nor do we argue as to whether the court below gave too narrow meaning to the Commission's control test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.384" offset="10144893">We assume, for present purposes that the court below correctly apply that test as relating only to the operational aspects of the transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.252" offset="10176345">In other words, what Mr. Ginnane is saying in his brief and before you is that he admits control, but he admits upon his terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.241" offset="10220335">The Court in this case said that Oklahoma directed, dominated, and controlled, (1) the transportation of its products, (2) the equipment concerned therewith, and (3), the personnel concerned therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.304" offset="10280626">In other words, this is Oklahoma's operation as a private carrier and not the operation of these people as contract carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.193" offset="10324093">Now, we don't feel that Mr. Ginnane has the right to assume things about the District Court's opinion which was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.919" offset="10355022">Now, the District Court arrived at -- arrived at each conclusion and decision in this case based upon all the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction together with the actual practices there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.943" offset="10435166">And it quoted from the Commission decision of H.B. Church Truck Service Company Common Carrier application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.316" offset="10472678">The question as to who has a right to control and direct must be answered in the light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction between the carrier and shipper and of the actual practices in the conduct to the operation there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.284" offset="10520534">No element of such facts and circumstances is by itself controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.990" offset="10539342">Well, if the Court did which I'm sure that it did and that the States did, examine all the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction which currently includes these methods of payment then it just as much in a position to answer whether or not these men are in substance or engaged in transportation, for-hire as it is whether or not these men or whether or not the company has the right to direct control and dominate the transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.142" offset="10671940">In other words, all these things were considered by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.267" offset="10688449">Another thing that I would like to point out is that I take it that their argument here is that these men have the essential risk of engaging in the transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.207" offset="10744247">That isn't correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.460" offset="10753233">These men leased their tractors to Oklahoma and of course it's payable on a cents per mile basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.720" offset="10778206">These men are not (Inaudible) truck people, and it would be -- there would be more risk to these men involved in a flat rate method of payment than it would be on a cents per mile, because the gas is burned on a mileage basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.083" offset="10863679">The oil is used on mileage basis and when these men determined, what's it is going to take to run that equipment, it's all done on a mileage basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.895" offset="10902967">That's the most accurate way that you could arrive at any type of expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.076" offset="10927626">Now Oklahoma pays for transportation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.919" offset="10959078">In other words, the rent payment is made regardless of whether or not there's anything hauled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.050" offset="10991574">Anywhere these trucks go, the rental payment is due and the wages of the drivers is due.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.552" offset="11037550">I think that Mr. Ginnane's real point in that connection was that no minimums are guaranteed and no amount of mileage is stipulated – guaranteed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2746.719" offset="11090213">Well I don't -- I don't really know that that would be material if that's the only thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.308" offset="11116648">Of course, they haven't suggested it to us before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.157" offset="11128038">Perhaps, we would have put in a minimum mileage, but I don't think it's a material in this case because here's a situation where a close relationship between the company and these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.760" offset="11182373">Now, the record indicates that -- well, in two instances here, that drivers were first -- the drivers of the company owned vehicles and they were promoted up through the ranks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.562" offset="11237648">Now, these men know how much transportation Oklahoma does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.683" offset="11258128">They know that that equipment is going to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.031" offset="11275473">They know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.461" offset="11277249">Now I know there's no minimum in there, but we'd be happy to supply one if that's the only objection and in this connection, if the equipment goes out loaded and comes back unloaded, it's Oklahoma who bears that cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.507" offset="11353422">And also Oklahoma will bear the risk of efficiently or inefficiently loading that equipment when it goes out and Oklahoma directs all those movements, and Oklahoma also selects this equipment and names the driver to drive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.544" offset="11421550">Now normally, that is the owner of the vehicle because the company has found that they have a better safety record when that's done and the equipment is better maintained when the owner drives it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.358" offset="11492812">But there are instances in this record where Oklahoma assigns different drivers to different trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.177" offset="11524054">In other words, that's not an ironclad rule and the District Court's opinion reflects that this is done whenever business, reasons or convenience make it necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.145" offset="11571911">So for this reason, we feel that there is no merit to the questions presented by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.912" offset="12862986">I tell them, “You can rent trucks just as you would rent them if you want to Hearst, as he put it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.742" offset="12890363">Now how does Hearst rent their trucks?</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.440" offset="12901125">They will rent them by the mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.638" offset="12909902">They don't rent them by the amount of goods that's transported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.030" offset="12923486">They rent them by the mile and Hearst will furnish insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.966" offset="12935189">It's common.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.487" offset="12937279">If you rent a car, when you drive it, the Hearst, they furnish the insurance, they furnish the car, they furnish the gas and oil and they repair the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.169" offset="12967999">They will tell you, “Now, we buy a $100 deductible insurance and if you don't want to pay that minimum of a $100, you pay us the next $3 a day or some extra premiums if you want more coverage” and I think that's the key to the leasing of the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.054" offset="13039574">It can have no basis whatsoever to the amount that's greatly transported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.564" offset="13061622">Does Hearst care how many people you put in the automobile when they rent it to you?</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.940" offset="13075101">Of course, they don't, so long as you don't put them on the roof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.585" offset="13093700">That's the key to the running of the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.049" offset="13103522">Now, I will say to this Court that that's not what clients like to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.495" offset="13121390">They want to find a device so that they can measure the rental of that equipment by the amount of crate that's carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.728" offset="13146258">That is wrong and I tell them further, “Who's going to drive that truck?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.327" offset="13168724">That employee and this is where I go further than Mr. Ginnane, that driver of that truck must be your employee and he must be employed by you just the same as every janitor, every production man, and every office man in your company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.826" offset="13226715">If you pay profit sharing, he gets profit sharing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.435" offset="13237164">If he -- if your people get vacations that truck driver gets vacations, you must pay social security, workmen's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.433" offset="13277080">And every benefit, every fringe benefit and everything else that you do in hiring employees, you must do for that employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.444" offset="13317099">If you require all your employees to have their picture taken and have it put in the employee's record, you also must do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.152" offset="13351999">Now that's where I go farther -- further than Mr. Ginnane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.616" offset="13361821">Now that's the difference between these cases that they have discussed in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.719" offset="13382196">This case is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.598" offset="13393795">And as you read this lower court cases on this problem, you will find that to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.291" offset="13416573">In every one of those cases, you will find something lacking, because they are trying to measure the amount of -- the amount they pay upon the amount crate transported or they're trying to avoid the benefit -- the detriments of certain back haul problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.680" offset="13506121">You will find in most of those cases that the shipper, the manufacturer, the private carrier manufactures the product that he wants to move one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.194" offset="13556172">He has nothing coming back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.047" offset="13571532">And in order to make private carriage work, just as you must -- it's true of common carriage or contract carriage, you have to put freight on that truck both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.120" offset="13611865">And so that they enter into devices in order to avoid the problem of driving that -- moving that truck empty one way, and that was again the trouble and I will agree with this Court, I will agree with Mr. Ginnane, that's wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="3699.727" offset="14902314">So that depending upon how much furniture they can have outbound and whether or not they had any return of raw materials determines their cost of transportation so they are taking the risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="4024.732" offset="16202271">Where they work -- the lease is based among the amount of freight that's going to be moved in that truck by one device or another then the risk is transferred to the lessor but where the shipper, the private carrier pays for the use of that truck, whether monthly, or weekly or a mileage basis irregardless of the amount of goods they ship to that truck then the risk has not been transferred because the shipper, the private carrier Oklahoma here has assumed the risk of how much business he is going to have, how much freight he's going to be able to get on to this truck, how much he's going to return on that truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.719" offset="16370291">And the cost of shipping his goods has gone up very tremendously as to whether or not he has a thousand pounds on the truck or whether he has 10,000 pounds in the truck or whether or not he can bring backs some goods on the return trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.715" offset="16446255">One of the problems here that I see was -- I think the motive in this case is -- I can't agree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.969" offset="16491290">They take the position that there has been a -- the evil here is the divergence of freight from a common or contract carrier to a private carrier and I think that must assume that these carriers have a vested right to a certain amount of freight.</text>

            <text syncTime="4115.206" offset="16564224">I think the issue here is to whether or not these people are violating the law and not the fact that the freight is moving from carrier from common and contract carriers or private because we must bear in mind that private carriers are recognized by the Congress as regulated carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.584" offset="16629739">And in the -- and in the preamble to the Act, Congress has said, it is hereby declared to be the national transportation policy of the Congress to provide for fair and impartial regulation of all modes of transportation subject to the provisions of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4162.741" offset="16754291">And so I feel that the Commission of all parties of this case should be asking for a fair administration of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.424" offset="16789086">It should not be taking the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.845" offset="16794728">There's been a divergence of freight to get in to that question and where -- we get far afield.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.261" offset="16824404">That was the cry of the railroads in the 1930s when the trucks started.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.694" offset="16842167">The truckers were able to give a more vigorous attention to business and that's how they grew.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.888" offset="16866931">And if you want to know the basic fact of why transport -- moving the freight is being diverted if you want to use the word common and contract carrier or private carriers because the common and contract carriers are now reaching the point that the railroads were in the 1930s and they're not as free to make -- give the service that the public needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.697" offset="16970167">And when the con -- when the common carriers are able to give service, they're going to get the freight back and they can't get the freight -- I don't think they should be getting the freight back to -- by appealing to this Court to assist them in making it difficult for a private industry to transport their own commodity.</text>

            <text syncTime="5266.494" offset="21169298">I think that's a terrible result.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.437" offset="21177135">We had a similar situation in Ohio, and our public utility laws are very similar to the ICC, the interstate -- the Congress copied their laws considerably from the States and States were in effect and before in our Ohio law was passed around 1925 and the ICC in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.217" offset="21252263">And our Commission, I think all Commissions are jealous of their prerogatives and their authorities and they have generally followed the same rules and that the lessors couldn't be drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.568" offset="21321644">And that situation came up in Ohio, that there, neither case reported 165 Ohio State 391 discussed by me in my brief that commenced at page 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.012" offset="21367411">And that was appealed to the courts and the Court did exactly the same thing as the District Court did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5322.648" offset="21393951">And in commenting on where the hiring and the trucking comes together, the truck -- the Court said, where however a driver is also furnished, then they maybe an engaging in such business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.920" offset="21447032">Now, the difference between our Court and the Commission, the ICC here, they recognize that there is a situation, where you must look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.578" offset="21481723">But they went on to say, however, whether there is, will depend in a particular instance upon the relationship between the driver of the truck and the one to whom the truck and driver are furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.301" offset="21524564">So the Court went on, examined this situation and found that in that case, that the law that the driver made a legitimate lease of his truck, and that he was legitimately hired and he was told where and how to do various things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.566" offset="21585586">And so, they found in that case that where the control was properly in the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.295" offset="21624560">If they'd overcome this presumption that might arise, where you see that the truck and the driver converging.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.756" offset="21658415">And I say that's the rule here that must be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.341" offset="21672730">I would say that it just as possible to have lack of control where they leased the Hearst truck and driving outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="5405.762" offset="21726438">I can imagine that in a desire to obtain efficiency, that they could say to this driver who can make up many arrangements, I represent a profit sharing company where they get a lot of efficiency in their plan by sharing percentage of the profits with their employees that you could go to your driver and I'll say we own or we lease this truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.888" offset="21810970">Now, we're willing to -- so that you can make some -- more money than just a truck driver, we will credit to this truck the amount of money that we would spend if we ship by common carrier and then we will charge the lease or the depreciation on the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.564" offset="21873664">We will charge your basic salary and we will charge all of the expenses of operating the truck, gas or everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5448.549" offset="21897592">And at the end of the period of time, you will see if we saved any money on this and we'll give you part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.261" offset="21920371">I think that it should be -- actually, you could come up with an arrangement that would be further a field from control that we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.481" offset="21953285">So the minds amend and make up many arrangements and if we sit down and nit-pick an arrangement, you could probably find something wrong with many of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.655" offset="21989961">I say it in a broad outline and I think the Commission did find that the Oklahoma Furniture properly controlled this operation and that the lease was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.395" offset="22036982">You say that Mr. Ginnane said that -- well, there's no minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5489.349" offset="22060805">But now the -- which as you filed applications for contracts in the Public Utilities Commission in Ohio, they get little rules and they have a rule that there must be a minimum stated in the contract, that you must guarantee a minimum of so many tons and I'll be frank to say that generally, you put in a hundred tons and you know if you've got a hundred tons a year, you're going to go broke.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.490" offset="22145337">That satisfies the Public Utilities Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.961" offset="22155264">I tested them once.</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.429" offset="22161115">I've been my contract that we will -- the shipper guarantees to the contract carrier all the freight that we ship a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.857" offset="22202807">I thought that was a better contract for my clients, and I would on -- and I put on the evidence of the amount of business that this manufacturer normally shifted on the years he'd been in business and he expected to be in business and that he's going to give this shipper, this carrier all of the freight that he had and there was considerable argument, but I proved my point that that was a legitimate contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.757" offset="22286399">Now, I've gone back to putting hundred tons a year and that makes everybody happy and my job easier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5550.845" offset="22306774">But I say here that the fact that there's no minimum guarantee isn't the important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5554.575" offset="22321716">The fact is that over the years as shown in this evidence, this Oklahoma Furniture has given all of their freight to these people to handle under long distance transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5565.483" offset="22365288">They've gotten all the freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.481" offset="22373334">And the fact that they -- sure they can hire a driver, they've got the union to overcome, the union could take a grievance if they fire the man but they -- the employer obviously can fire a driver for misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.992" offset="22431326">But the fact of the matter is that these drivers have been there over a long number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.262" offset="22448462">That's the proof to pudding, what's been the result?</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.102" offset="22459747">These drivers have affirmed the job and the company has kept their leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.808" offset="22478555">They -- if they did fire a driver today, they can't cancel that lease for 30 days and that man is going to get his money from that truck for 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5603.484" offset="22517321">It's true that he wouldn't have to drive it, he wouldn't have to assign it, I suppose, but the facts of the matter is that over the years, these people have been employed and the truck has been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.138" offset="22567894">That's the proof of the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.933" offset="22627140">If I can't enlighten the Court, I will -- I have completed everything I think I can say on this subject.</text>
