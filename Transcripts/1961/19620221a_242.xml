            <label>Mr. Chester Bordeau</label>
            <text syncTime="24.199" offset="200182">Mr. Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.486" offset="221288">Many of the arguments that I have prepared for this Court have been more or less discussed in the previous argument but I would like to answer some of the various questions that were put or at least to try to answer them in a way that I see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.794" offset="290565">As Your Honors know, this case involves a controversy between former employees of the Glidden Company, the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.499" offset="333406">It was the claim of these respondents that there was a breach of the collective bargaining agreement covering these employees while they were employed at the Elmhurst plant of the petitioner in Long Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.735" offset="390353">When that collective bargaining agreement expired and when the plant was closed and when the employment of the employee thus terminated, a claim was then made by the employees that by reason of certain seniority rights contained in the collective bargaining agreement that they were entitled to be employed or continued in the employ of the petitioner at a new plant which the petitioner had established in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.309" offset="520652">They were not given this right to continue in employment with the -- the seniority rights which they claim have accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.783" offset="558477">The case was brought in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, and was removed by the petitioner to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with the claim that there was a diversity of citizenship in the requisite amount in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.968" offset="647293">And now in this case of -- at the trial term which was held before the Honorable Edmund Palmieri, a judgment was entered dismissing the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.057" offset="695568">An appeal was taken by the respondents to the United States District Court for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.499" offset="725347">That appeal was argued before the Honorable J. Edward Lumbard, the Chief Judge of that court and a circuit judge before the Honorable J. Warren Madden of the United States Court of Claims, who have been designated by the Chief Justice to sit on the appeal in this case during that one week in February 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.729" offset="842271">Now, the third judge in the division which heard this appeal was Honorable Sterry Waterman of Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.924" offset="887097">The result of the hearing before the appellate court was that Judge Madden wrote the majority opinion in which he reversed the lower court and remanded the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.091" offset="951777">He was joined in that reversal by Judge Waterman.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.537" offset="973511">The -- Judge Lumbard dissented in an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.820" offset="1002663">It was on the basis of the fact that Judge Madden as a judge of the Court of Claims was not an Article III judge that we have petitioned in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.946" offset="1055117">There were other reasons why we made a petition to this Court or the declaration by this Court that the Court has constituted and as the decision occurred was without jurisdiction to render the judgment against the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.803" offset="1158562">Judge Madden was appointed by President Roosevelt in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.701" offset="1186147">A copy of the Commission is at -- appears at page 7 of our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.978" offset="1219271">He was designated to the office or nominated rather to the office of the judge of the Court of Claims upon the duties and the services of the judge of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.415" offset="1273083">In 1961, the Chief Justice in a designation and assignment which appear as an appendix to our main brief assigned that Judge Madden to sit as a circuit judge in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.020" offset="1355421">There is no question presented here as to the regularity of the assignment and designation made by the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.590" offset="1393768">There were no in -- no defects in the carrying out the regulation of the statute permitting the assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.577" offset="1433684">It is the claim of the petitioner that the statute pursuant to which the Chief Justice maybe assigned and then designation of Judge Madden to sit in the Article III court is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.310" offset="1496586">In that, Judge Madden was the judge of an Article I court without the constitutional protection which is granted to Article III judges under the provision of Section 1 of Article III.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.407" offset="1896991">His appointment was to a court which had been declared unanimously by this Court to be an Article I court.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.092" offset="2059786">And I think the answer to that question, Mr. Justice Whittaker, depending on which side the Court may feel the correct answer to be is decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.162" offset="2108061">I have tried to frame that.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.711" offset="2114226">I've tried to frame it probably a little imperfectly at pages 7 and 8 of my reply brief which I would like to clarify by a statement running like this, "An Article I court is one granted by Congress the power and the function to determine judicially matters which are inherently susceptible to congressional determination under Article I and or, if I may use that phrase, to deal with those matters non-judicially which are within the power and the function of the Congress and all of which may be delegable by Congress."</text>
            <text syncTime="559.389" offset="2340968">That is what I gather from the various decisions which I have had the opportunity to read.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.026" offset="2559457">It was our case ruled by a reason of a collective bargaining agreement entered into between an employer, the petitioner and the collective bargaining agent representing the employees of that employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.362" offset="2616822">There's a question of whether or not it was a state law or federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="673.673" offset="2798111">And this will be slightly repetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.771" offset="2814412">And Article III court is one granted by Congress the power and the function to determine judicially cases or controversies described in Section 2 of Article III arising under the Constitution or federal laws or arising under other laws in cases of diversity of citizenship which are not inherently susceptible to congressional determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.060" offset="2935620">Now, I think those two definitions describe the differences and the characteristics of an Article I and an Article II court.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.384" offset="2976893">A question which is posed by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Lurk case in asking what are the characteristics of the different courts in which we are dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.978" offset="3015241">I think this definition, which I have submitted in this form, is an attempt to describe what the courts have said in making the distinction between Article I and Article III courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.751" offset="3070412">And I think, it is a distinction which is solved for there is no reason in my mind why Congress should not have the privilege and the right to have courts or tribunals which are subject to its whim, we call it that with respect to their tenure of office, with respect to their compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.502" offset="3173334">If they -- because of this fact that this courts which are created by Congress under Article I had been created for the purpose of carrying out the powers and the functions of Congress and not any other branch of Government, it was for the purpose of carrying out the power and the function of Congress of the Court of Claims was established in 1854 or 1855.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.503" offset="3293393">As a matter of fact in the debates which appeared in the congressional glow.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.235" offset="3316276">It was emphasized throughout the many and many pages of discussion with respect to the establishment of the Court of Claims that it was being created because of the very heavy duty of burden which have been placed upon the Congress in passing upon bills relating to compensation and debts owing by the United States to individuals and others.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.356" offset="5288835">But I -- in Your Honor's statement, it seems to be -- it seems to me that one of the pause runs through it as being more or less conclusive in your mind is a the fact that a court is creative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.356" offset="5352782">Now, I think the term "court" in itself does not necessarily decide the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.954" offset="5375143">You may have a court under Article I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.809" offset="5386637">You may have a court under Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.002" offset="5395414">You may call it a tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.383" offset="5400952">You may call it an agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.436" offset="5409102">But the fact still remains that a court is not the determining factor in my mind because a court has certain powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.440" offset="5449122">The court has certain functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.740" offset="5462288">And I think in determining this, what are those powers and what are those functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.470" offset="5489246">The way you would tell the character and the characteristics of a person is by what he does, what is he empowered to do, not what he is called but what he does.</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.929" offset="5583078">What everybody calls Article III courts that come in question before those courts everyday and questions come before this Court which could have been taking entirely out of judicial determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1509.361" offset="6140844">Mr. Bordeau, we're always admonished to be realistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.952" offset="6151189">Now, the starting point of this whole legislative court business is American Insurance Company against Canter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.776" offset="6178461">And then this Court was confronted with a very practical problem namely, what to do with Florida?</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.681" offset="6206046">Nobody knowing what will become of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.029" offset="6215450">How long it will remain a territory?</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.311" offset="6224645">When it will be called into a state and should this Court reach the conclusion that Article III doesn't limit the power of Congress in order to deal with newly acquired territory to establish courts and not give them life tenures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.890" offset="6286921">That's the source of all these business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.173" offset="6296116">In short, what they did, though they didn't say it in words and to say the necessary improper clause of Article I, enables Congress not only to it -- of this country, not only to acquire a new territory but to make effective its Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.250" offset="6360377">And one way to having Government is to having courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.348" offset="6372812">But they shrank from requiring life tenure judges in the new terri -- in the Louisiana purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.964" offset="6399248">That's the history of this business and unless we remember that all of this is a metaphysical obfuscation.</text>
