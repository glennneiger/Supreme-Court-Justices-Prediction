            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Theodore R. Gibson, Petitioner, versus Florida Legislative Investigating Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.876" offset="139870">Mr. Carter, you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="15.264" stopTime="291.785">
            <label>Mr. Robert L. Carter</label>
            <text syncTime="15.264" offset="165470">At the close of the argument yesterday, Mr. Justice White raised the question and asked me to address myself to it, on today.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.206" offset="217192">I can’t repeat the question in words, but the burden of it as I understood it was whether why was it not in the interest of the organization to verify the fact that the person’s name, that alleged the communists were not in Memphis and therefore to give the testimony requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.168" offset="309039">The reason that this was not done and I think that the record is clear, the reading of the record makes clear that these 14 persons named by virtue of the fact that the membership in the organization has only existed for one year and it’s obvious that these persons that were -- supposed persons were named or persons that if they had any connection with the organization at all, would have been predated 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.438" offset="426172">The reason that this was not done is because of the fact that petitioner believed that he would place in jeopardy the constitutional right of freedom of association and the privacy in that association which this Court protected and secured in NAACP versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.285" offset="517496">Now, the issue that comes down to it is if -- that if the petitioner answers that the question, where will he stop?</text>
            <text syncTime="112.272" offset="553441">The next question will be a list of Negro school teachers and proffered with the statement that we have reason to believe that these persons are members of the Communist Party, will you verify as to whether they are members of your organization or ministers for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.283" offset="617493">And the fact that this is itself can be gleaned from the Court -- by the Court -- by reading of the record at page 241, in which on the -- when the petitioner came back to the committee on the second time, counsel for the petitioner need be with the -- it begins on about -- at page 239, but looking at the middle of page 241, he was asked to disclose whether or not Reverend Edward Graham was a member of the NAACP.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.619" offset="794917">Mr. Holt said that Reverend Graham that -- what's -- the pertinence of the question is that Reverend Graham is and has been a member of the organization in Dade County that over a period of years, he is or has been a member of certain organizations which have been listed as subversive, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.624" offset="866910">Now, we contend that the committee was not really looking for these persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.030" offset="904526">That what the committee was in fact doing and what is before this Court, is not a discussion of an abstract principle of state power but the same issue which was before this Court in NAACP versus Alabama and the Bates case and in the case from Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.199" offset="985192">And that is that, and I have not stressed this in the argument in this case because this case does not come here of a -- as a case of first impression, but this Court as I understood its opinion in both cases held that this being an organization of a minority group, unpopular, that the freedom of persons or their desire to the persons who might ordinarily join would be deterred by virtue of the fact that they might be disclosed and -- their names might be disclosed, their identity might be disclosed, and therefore, they would be subjected to kinds of intimidations, intimidation which would prevent their doing what the Constitution says that they can do and that is to participate in a lawful group activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.549" offset="1190619">For this reason, in that case, this Court said that there must be a status with some compelling -- of compelling proportions in order for the intrusion in this area to be allowed, and secondly, that the disclosure must be relevant to a valid legislative objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.648" offset="1267001">Now --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="291.785" offset="1271495">Do you claim in this case that the state had no power to contest this investigation no const -- (Inaudible) -- it was a constitutionally unauthorized investigation?</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="302.329" stopTime="375.559">

            <text syncTime="302.329" offset="1313708">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.749" offset="1315380">I don't have -- I don't think I have to make that argument, but I do think that what the state must disclose, is not only that the interest and that is the interest here being investigation of subversion, but that the state's interest must be directed one to a valid legislative objective and it must show that there is some basis for the inquiry in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.700" offset="1415168">In other words, this is not a case as it was in -- but Baron, Black or Braden or Wilkinson in which the petitioner was asked, "Are you a member of the Communist Party?"</text>
            <text syncTime="337.198" offset="1453202">Nor is this the case in which the -- if there is an assertion by the investigators that the organization is subversive nor is it a case in which there is an -- any assertion at all that the organization engaged in any illegal or unconstitutional activities, nor as in Wilkinson and Braden had there been any showing that the inquiry is directed to any legislative objective that there is any legislation being composed which would deal with this particular problem, I must say that I don't know what this -- what they could do in this instance validly legislated.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.369" offset="1689872">-- if the state were really interested in information, then of course it could do this in another way, but what I was attempting to define was that the limits what I regard as state power.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.261" offset="1741490">And in this instance, it seems to me that the state has to make this kind of showing or else, what is really occurring is that the state can say, “We are concerned with the infiltration of communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.303" offset="1805646">We have reason to believe that they're members of subversive organizations, of subversive groups and a particular organization, and it that regard it can destroy the enclosure which this Court has erected around freedom of association in NAACP versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.441" offset="1870117">And I think that this Court, that this is a retreat them from that decision which I would respectfully urge that this Court not take.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.076" offset="1912748">Now, in further answer to Mr. Justice Goldberg's inquiry, it does seem to me that if the -- if there was any real interest here in evidencing to the petitioner's organization that we have the information that these 13 people are members of the party, they're likely to taint your organization, you be careful about them that what they can do is to inform.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.624" offset="2030926">They could inform the petitioner's organization to watch out for these persons and permit them if they -- if such people are in the organization to purge them from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.549" offset="2078574">But if they did not do that, what they did was to attempt to -- by this means, we think to get constructive possession of the membership list.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.504" offset="2118384">And we say if the Court please, that this case is of the same of a piece with the same situation which was before this Court from Alabama, Louisiana and Arkansas that if the Court will read the first opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.208" offset="2201245">But the Supreme Court of Florida took this Court's opinion in NAACP versus Alabama and said, that the committee at that time was seeking the possession of the entire membership list.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.027" offset="2256520">But the Court said, in view of NAACP versus Alabama, we do not hold that you can have that but that -- on the grounds that you're looking for a communist in the organization, you may require an answer to this -- to specific questions asked by -- as to whether a person -- validating as to whether a person belongs to this organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.335" offset="2349725">And we if the Court please, that this is a legalism, that what this does by not placing any real predicate, any real indication by the Court, any real showing by the committee that there is some link, some real link between the organization and communism that what is in -- it in fact saying is that we, merely by virtue of the fact that we alleged that certain -- a person is a communist, then we can get your -- just your membership was entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.115" offset="2496846">And we think that this gives the individual whose custodian of the listing, the only person who can protect the membership list and the freedom for association of the organization's members.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.173" offset="2537075">In this instance, gives him no principles on which to stand, he acts -- he doesn't know what names to give up, he has to give up all the names or else he has no way of knowing whether these persons who are called communists are in fact communists or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.203" offset="2873219">And that would present also to the Court a question as to whether or not the individuals who was custodian of the list had a reason to know and believe and understand that this is exactly what the organization is doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.410" offset="5997986">If Your Honors please, I was a little surprised today to see my opponent taking the position that in addition to the nexus between communist activities or subversion and people within this organization that we had to show an addition before we could raise these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.058" offset="6108641">Some evidence said this organization as such was engaging in some sort of subversive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.050" offset="6144585">Now this is not the question, if Your Honors please, this case came before this Court only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.531" offset="6170499">It is not a question embraced in the petition for the writ that you issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.302" offset="6197561">Now, if you refer that these two petition for the writ itself, you will see the question presented is quite substantially different from the contentions being made by counsel for the petitioner here in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.854" offset="6267779">The question is presented in the petition for the writ is whether or not under the circumstances in this case, we could compel these answers without violating the freedom of association and privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.395" offset="6341966">In the absence of some showing of a nexus between the Communist Party or communist front organizations and their subversive activities in the petitioner's organization, I deem that to be a proper question, if Your Honors please, and I deem that to be the question that's before the Court for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.413" offset="6410094">And I say that if a nexus is established by this record showed that there's reason to believe that people connected with a subversive organizations are or might be members of the Miami branch of the NAACP what you have an actuality before the Court, is Uphaus against Wyman over and over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.249" offset="6529421">Now, it is not required and was not required in the Uphaus case that the Legislative Committee of New Hampshire operating as a one-man committee through the Attorney General, show that the World Fellowship organization had engaged in any subversive activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.679" offset="6615103">But the nexus in that case was that some 18 or 19 members of the Communist Party and/or communist front affiliation groups had spoke at meetings in a summer camp run by the World Fellowship Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.550" offset="6690544">That was the sole nexus in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.343" offset="6705800">That record didn't purport to show that the World Fellowship Association as such had engaged in any subversive activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.889" offset="6811961">That Dr. Uphaus himself had attended that Warsaw Convention where the United States was censured for using germ warfare allegedly in Korea and there were communist pamphlets, some wanted by smaller talk.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.843" offset="7055736">And at the summer camp run by this association had their speakers of some -- I believe 19 speakers, some of whom had been members of the Communist Party and some of whom had been members of various front organizations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2496.749" offset="10091374">Now, when we called him up there, we made our position clear by the same token, he made his clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.953" offset="10120213">If you think I've exaggerated his position, you look at page 44 and 45 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.042" offset="10176533">On page 44, and let me say, there's been some talk of 14 members of the Communist Party here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.700" offset="10207148">Mr. Strickland did identify 14 people as members of the Communist Party and those 14 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.309" offset="10233584">He said, he had reason to believe, might have been members of the NAACP or had attended meetings of it, but there were another 33 people that he identified as members of the party or communist front associations, and another five members of the Communist Party itself which he had no information in regard to whether they had been associated with the NAACP in any capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.303" offset="10341627">If you look at the last question on page 44, I say to the Reverend Gibson that I have this list of people before me that they have been -- according to my information affiliated with the party or various front organizations at sometimes -- and I want to know whether or not -- I didn't have any photographs of these men, the first 14 men I'd showed in photographs of and was -- got to rely in on his memory of the faces, he admitted that sometimes you don't associate name with the face and sometimes you don't recall a name.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.938" offset="10576102">This he declined to do and if you look on page 45, I asked this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.626" offset="10590939">Reverend, so there won't be any misunderstanding on your position, regardless of the names or the information that I have concerning the names of the people that I have before me here, you simply will not bring your records here for the purpose of comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.474" offset="10654260">You yourself examining them, he said, “No sir, I wouldn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="2663.251" offset="10757392">Now, if Your Honors please, they didn't raise any question then and that was the time to do it, that we haven't -- we hadn't produced enough evidence in their presence, that these people were subversives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.772" offset="10827504">That's the time they should have done it if they wanted to raise that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.394" offset="10845999">He says, my position is, I'm not going to bring those records into this hearing room on any condition for any purpose, purely and separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.501" offset="10898348">Now, if his conviction is to be set aside under this condition, if Your Honors please, on the basis of the evidence actually presented in the presence of he and his counsel is not sufficient to show a nexus, you are simply saying that an investigation, you can't have one because you've got to have conclusive proof in order to justify the inquiry and if you have conclusive proof sir, there is no objective to the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.069" offset="11032722">And so, you are simply saying that you just can't operate in this field, if this conviction is to be upset in my judgment and that conclusion is absolutely inescapable in my mind as a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.233" offset="11081310">As one way or the other, you either got to have conclusive proof or you haven't?</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.803" offset="11111612">Now, in Uphaus, Your Honors made this comment about an issue of the nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.521" offset="11142437">You said, the nexus -- the proof in regard to the nexus is “not conclusive but sufficiently relevant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.083" offset="11196771">That's the test you laid down in Uphaus versus Wyman, not conclusive but sufficiently relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.650" offset="11231044">Now, no court has ever said as I understand the decision, what degree of proof must be laid down to show the nexus?</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.933" offset="11276079">I have never seen that degree of proof laid out in any decision, but you talked about reason to believe in some of these cases, reasonable grounds to think, I don't think it means the same as probable cause in a search warrant case, but if it does, the evidence before the Court is sufficient to satisfy that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.601" offset="11358835">Would you prefer please to some of the testimony of a -- an investigator in this case beginning on page 24, down in the middle he identified a woman that he says she has information, this is record page 24, addressed to Burnberg of Miami as a member of the League of the Communist Party and he gives the court Number 357.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.533" offset="11466564">He says he has all the information that she is a member of front organization cited by the House Un-American Activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.234" offset="11497284">Now, Mr. Justice Harlan, at this point I was simply laying enough evidence out there for the purpose of making the relevancy of the inquiry to this witness apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.524" offset="11550469">Think of the position the committee is in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.690" offset="11563112">If I've got to stop the inquiry with this witness to prove that his satisfaction conclusively that there's real grounds, in a factual way for me to propound the questions to him, I can't find anything but irrelevant issues throughout this hearing and I could never progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.941" offset="11636151">Every time I ask him a question he's going to say, “As a matter of proof, Mr. Hawes, what is a nexus, what is the relevance?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.002" offset="11672409">You see it and the investigation cannot progress from a practical standpoint because the committee will be required to stop and put on these side issues factually rather than merely stating to the witness what the relevance is.</text>
