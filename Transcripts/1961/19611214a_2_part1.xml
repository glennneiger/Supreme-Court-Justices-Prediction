            <text syncTime="18.872" offset="178866">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.451" offset="197151">The last question yesterday by Mr. Justice Brennan is the matter which I would like to discuss a little bit more fully than I did yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.407" offset="229021">The background relating of the Metlakatla Community is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.123" offset="259845">The Tsimshian Indians of British Columbia and of an area of British Columbia which actually spilled over in the Southeast Alaska had been the recipients -- or a group of them had been the recipients of the benefits of a missionary by the name of William Duncan in the second half of the 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.963" offset="351274">Mr. Duncan, the late missionary, had organized a community of Metlakatla in British Columbia, but had run into difficulties with the Dominion Government and with the Missionary Society which he represented and had led.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.164" offset="411982">At that time, Dr. Henry Ward Beecher and other outstanding personalities in the United States became very much interested in the matter and interested President Grover Cleveland in the situation at Metlakatla. Father Duncan came to Washington and presented his case -- his problems to the United States Government and the invitation to this group to come to Alaska resulted from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.361" offset="544789">As indicated, Father Duncan, with a group of members of the Metlakatla Indian Community in British Columbia then moved -- and moved on a short distance, 70 miles to Southeast Alaska and established the community on the Annette Islands Reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.973" offset="619290">The Annette Islands were originally set aside by executive action but because a question as to legality of that arose, the Congress in 1891 had an act which set aside the Annette Island specifically by Congressional action as a reservation, as a United States Reservation for the Metlakatla Indians and such Indians as may join them later which incidentally it was typical language for a good number of Indian Reservation statutes in the law code of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.048" offset="743528">May I ask you, how about the invitational was extended, was the -- extended by the President or was it through an act of Congress?</text>

            <text syncTime="174.514" offset="801416">It was not by an act of Congress. These people settled in 1887, four years prior to the first action by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.305" offset="832554">Because of an Attorney General's opinion which raised a question as to whether all of these can be done by executive action, Congress then passed this 1891 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.891" offset="878947">The -- as far as this 1891 Act is concerned and there is certain language in it that is absolutely crucial to the discussion that we -- of that the State of Alaska, well, made later on, the language of the Act specifically provides that the use of this reservation shall be subject to the rules and regulations and restrictions imposed by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.660" offset="990020">Now, following the passage of 1891 Act, this community developed at Metlakatla.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.533" offset="1017501">Father Duncan was extremely active in strengthening its commercial -- strengthening the economy of the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.225" offset="1060237">He got this Indian group very quickly involved in commercial fishing which just began around the 1890s as a commercial fishing exploitation of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.751" offset="1102346">It was started there and this particular group really got in on the ground floor and one of the first things that happened and this was in the 1890s, a cannery was established in Alaska -- in -- at Metlakatla owned by the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.800" offset="1170578">This cannery has continued in existence since then on and off, it burned down at one time in the early 20th Century and was rebuilt and has -- un-interruptibly in existence since, I believe, around 1915 or roughly 46 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.486" offset="1437341">The -- as I indicated the cannery became one of the key elements in economic development of the community and this is really is of great significance in connection with the fish trap situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.060" offset="1499617">The fact is, that fishing alone by and large has not been able to sus -- to sustain a village or any community in Alaska on an economically sound basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.092" offset="1555728">The reason why Metlakatla as distinct from other communities has been able to develop a viable economy has been this interaction between fishing and the cannery.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.375" offset="1604838">This cannery has always been owned by the Metlakatlans.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.737" offset="1618317">The members of the community first of all work in the cannery and thereby, the community is therefore -- the income from fishing is supplemented by the income from the payroll at the cannery.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.529" offset="1669517">And furthermore, its profit is derived from cannery and this is really the most substantial benefit of this fishing economy, the profit in cannery and that has been over the years plowed back into the community through various community projects which the community engages in the off season.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.303" offset="1744541">In other words, the fishermen are then employed in building roads and doing various other things during the off season and the profit of the cannery is used in this manner and it is in this fashion that the Metlakatla Indian Community as distinct from some other fishing communities in Alaska was able to establish a viable economy.</text>

            <text syncTime="493.469" offset="2077236">The fact that the United States Government was aware of the -- of this economic problem is illustrated then by the specific action of the President, President Wilson in 1916, in spelling out the boundaries of the Reserve with particular reference to the fishing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.044" offset="2175561">And the specific decision that was made in by the President in 1916 is to define the boundaries as extending 3000 feet into the ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.428" offset="2221119">This was an exclusive fishing reserve as spelled out by President Wilson's proclamation in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.191" offset="2252152">If there ever was any question as to the President's power to issue this proclamation, it was later addressed -- addressed in 1934 when the Congress passed a specific statute which specifically confirmed previous presidential action in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.555" offset="2317563">What was, therefore, done was the setting aside of a -- of a water reservation of fifty-six-and-a-half square miles subject to the control of the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.145" offset="2367927">This reservation was considered by this Court in the Alaska Pacific Fisheries case in 1918 and it was at that time confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.647" offset="2409932">It was also mentioned in the case of Hynes versus Grimes by the Supreme Court in 1949 and as Mr. Justice Douglas raised the question at the last argument concerning Hynes versus Grimes, I just want to emphasize that there were two distinct holdings in Hynes versus Grimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.780" offset="2486523">The first holding was that and that was in connection with the Karluk Reservation that reservations of this type are valid that they may be established and this particular reservation of Metlakatla Reservation was referred to in the decision of the Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.449" offset="2557158">The Court then went on to say that the criminal sanctions of the White Act do not protect such a reservation that this second holding of the Hynes -- in Hynes versus Grimes has no real bearing on the facts in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.411" offset="2813053">But, when it took this action, one has to note that the Public Law 280 specifically provides that Indians are not to be deprived of right, privileges or immunities afforded under federal statutes with respect to fishing or the control, licensing and regulation thereon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.063" offset="7667649">Now, the posture of this case comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.262" offset="7676426">Alaska says that its statute, in spite of what I thought were pretty plain reservations, prohibit this Indian trap fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.940" offset="7719163">The Secretary of the Interior by his regulation says they're entitled to fish there and one or the other has got to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.885" offset="7746957">This Court has no alternative and neither to say Section 4 of a Statehood Act which says that the absolute jurisdiction and control of these Indian fishing rights shall be and remain with the United States until dispose by it is, is out, it's unconstitutional because as Alaska says, the conflict with the equal footing doctrine or for some of the other reasons I guess or you must hold that those Alaska's statutes fall before the federal act of Congress reserving absolute jurisdiction and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.609" offset="7885824">The fact is that when this complaint was filed, when the Alaska Statehood Act was passed, these people were fishing there under regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.609" offset="7941831">The United States in Section 4 of the Statehood Act gave to the new State the power and jurisdiction over fishing subject to they're getting regulatory machinery and shape under Section 6 (e) which had been adverted to and then they said that excludes Indian property rights including fishing rights which are reserved under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.910" offset="8079026">I submit that the Unites States have the power to make that provision at the time notwithstanding the state court's views as to the invalidity of Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.216" offset="8132211">Now before I pass on to whether Section 4 is invalid, I would like to associate myself with something I was sorry Mr. Schifter didn't get to deal with in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.949" offset="8175156">I -- I thought it was quite a lended credence as to the obvious anxiety with which matters of fish traps are dealt with by Alaska and its Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.144" offset="8239940">You will find better hostility in this long opinion of the Supreme Court of Alaska towards the fish trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.157" offset="8268048">Mr. Schifter has documented that beautifully in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.485" offset="8285288">The fish trap in Alaska is hated symbol of colonialism, Alaska colonialism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.503" offset="8313396">Freight operators out of Seattle mostly running these big fish traps, recruiting their crews in Alaska, Alaska didn't even get the cigarette money that that the crews spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.844" offset="8366791">It is an intense emotional issue with Alaska and it does enable us to understand the -- the attitude and approach of state officials and state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.047" offset="8411512">Now, to pass that because it is fully covered and fully documented by Mr. Schifter, I would like to go to the reasons which the state court gives in this lengthy opinion for the invalidity of Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.395" offset="8464906">It's -- Section 4 has got to fall, it reaches the point directly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.732" offset="12154337">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.971" offset="12167293">I appear here on behalf of the Federal Government in support of the position of the appellants that the State of Alaska has no power to impose its fish trap regulations upon these appellants, but rather that the continued absolute jurisdiction and control over these matters still resides within the control of Federal Government acting through the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.997" offset="12267395">Perhaps before I begin my affirmative argument in support of the appellant's position, it might be helpful if I try to -- in my answer to a several of the particular questions which had been raised by members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.291" offset="12328521">First, with relation to Section 6 (e) which is -- and the Westland proviso, the Statehood Act itself provided that for -- that fisheries and wildlife resources should not be transferred to the State, but continue on the federal control where they've been since Alaska become a territory until the Secretary of the Interior was satisfied that Alaska has provided appropriate fishing and wildlife resource legislation in the broad national interest and then it provided for certification and in -- if he was so satisfied and then the -- the resources and the enforcement machinery will be turnover to Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.500" offset="12485360">Now, the Secretary did make the certification on April 1959, shortly after Alaska became a state, Alaska became a state on January 3, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.437" offset="12525171">But I think it's important Mr. Justice Brennan to point out that at the time the Secretary made that certification, two things were in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.782" offset="12554533">One, he'd already proposed to continue his fishing regulations with relation to these appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.406" offset="12576998">He had issued a proposed regulation permitting these appellants to continue and two, the Alaska statute which was then in effect, the Alaska statute prohibiting fish traps said nothing in this statute shall be construed to violate Section 4 of the Statehood Act which --</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.696" offset="12682115">The certification did not become effective until January 1, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.753" offset="12698415">But what I just want to point out is that the Secretary did not file the certification, assumed that the Alaska fish traps statutes applied to these appellant Indians because he himself had continued to regulate them and the statute, the Alaska statute which was then in effect contained a section which said, “Nothing in this statute shall contravene anything in Section 4 of the Statehood Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.248" offset="12784410">Now, we're precluded from arguing on the basis of the Alaska statute because the Alaska Supreme Court has since that the time construed it to apply to these appellants' fish traps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.475" offset="12821295">Now, as to what the power of the Secretary would be as to these Indians or other Indians in the future, I want to make it clear that in point of view of the Federal Government, he does not have power at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.862" offset="12874794">Section 4 refers to fishing rights held at the time of Statehood, held at the time of Statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.293" offset="12904573">And as we construe Section 4, if I may intervene to go back just a minute, Section 6 (e) was in the Statehood Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.829" offset="12946683">That's the transfer of jurisdiction over wildlife and fishing to the State, but Section 4 was also on the Statehood Act, the very same Act provided for reservation of Indian fishing rights and so that Section 4 read in pairing material with Section 6 (e) reserved fishing rights whatever that maybe.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.308" offset="13884583">If I may, at the outset, I'd like to be with the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alaska, which the Attorney General of the State has not thought it necessary to support in his brief because I would like to make it clear to the Court that in our view, the propositions -- the legal propositions announced by the Supreme of Alaska are wrong, and -- and should be repudiated by this Court because they have a -- well radiation beyond this particular case with relation to the Indians of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.897" offset="14014986">I do not intend unless the Court should wish me to stand a great deal of time on -- on -- on these issues because the State does not seek to support them, but I would like to state our position on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.278" offset="14052498">And the first position is the Supreme Court of Alaska said that the Indian power of Congress does not extend to Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.279" offset="14080502">It may extend to the rest of the continental United States but it does not extend to Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.841" offset="14098787">That is refuted by any -- by three or four decisions of this Court which the Alaska Pacific Fisheries case and (Inaudible) case and Hynes against Grimes Packing and decisions in the lower courts which have held that -- that the Indian power of Congress does extend to Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.596" offset="14165765">It's -- it's refuted by the consistent legislative Congress from the time it began rarely to legislate for Alaska in 1884 and the Organic Act of 1884 in which made special provision for -- for Alaska Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.610" offset="14221772">It's refuted by the Metlakatla legislation by the extension of the Wheeler-Howard Act, the Indian Reorganization Act, one of the great charters of Indian progress in this country to Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.505" offset="14265344">It's -- it's even refuted by the provisions of the 19 -- 1953 statue that Mr. Justice Frankfurter was asking about, extending criminal jurisdiction to Alaska but excluding fishing plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.577" offset="14309648">So I think there's really nothing to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.937" offset="14319156">And the second point, the Supreme Court of Alaska makes or suggests is that equal footing prevents a reservation by the Federal Government as we think it tried to do in Section 4 of the Statehood Act, of rights with relation to Indians and Alaska and again the decisions of this Court as Mr. Cragun has indicated consistently hold otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.269" offset="14404420">What the Court has held is that in a Statehood Act, the Federal Government can reserve rights which it would have the power to exercise under the regular granted provisions of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.367" offset="14452799">In Coyle against Oklahoma, the case which said Oklahoma couldn't -- could not be prevented from moving its capital from Guthrie to Oklahoma by prohibition in the Oklahoma City by prohibition in Statehood Act, the Court three times when out of its way to indicate that with respect to those matters, particularly Indian matters which the Federal Government have granted powers on the Commerce Clause, of course it could reserve powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.802" offset="14558542">And -- and this was repeated in the Sandoval and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.440" offset="14573171">And I think almost every Statehood Act since the 1880's or 1870's has contained a reservation with relation to Indians except Hawaii which has no Indians and they've contained a reservation with relation to Hawaiian natives in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.654" offset="14637955">And so that's the second point of the Supreme Court of Alaska which I think it's just wrong if may say so with respect to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.965" offset="14671182">Then the Supreme Court of Alaska seem to think that the reservation in Section 4 which reserves to the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Federal Government land and property held by for the Indians including fishing rights, reserve that -- that that failed because the -- there wasn't a meeting of their minds between the State of Alaska and Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.041" offset="14775568">Now, we spell at the answer to that in our -- in our brief and I think for the short answer that I may say is that the Alaska Statehood Act provided that the people of Alaska would have to take a vote on the entire statement under -- under disclaimer provision, the one we have here and if they adopted it, as they did, the Constitution of Alaska shall be deemed to be amended in pursuance thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.419" offset="14880998">So, I think there's nothing to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.690" offset="14894164">Then the last point made by the -- by the Supreme Court of Alaska in this respect is that the Omnibus Act Amendments, that's the Amendment which -- which said that the absolute jurisdiction and control of the United States didn't continue for federally owned lands generally and only for lands which were held by for the natives, but that was invalid because it was passed after Statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.696" offset="14994160">The State does not rest on that because I think it would not want that the grant of jurisdiction that it received under that Act over federal lands generally to be invalidated, but I think that legally speaking, the Supreme Court of Alaska was erroneous there to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.441" offset="15061138">Because first, it's very clear from the legislative history that Congress thought it was correcting an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.566" offset="15081618">It says in the -- in the reports, we intended to limit this after jurisdiction and control only to native, to Indian lands and we inadvertently did more and of course there's a tremendous area of Alaska which -- in Alaska would be deprived of the police power if the words were taken literally, and that's why they amended it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.723" offset="15158314">I should say -- I think there were questions asked about public lands in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.138" offset="15179943">The Statehood Act does contain provisions for setting aside of defense area of Alaska in which the Federal Government would have exclusive provision -- exclusive authority completely but that's in a separate section with its own powers and authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.056" offset="15239607">As to the other public lands and -- and this defense area was limited geographically to a certain section of Alaska, as to the others, Commerce has made it clear that the normal civil and clinical jurisdiction extends to the federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.419" offset="15297076">Now, I think I would like to turn to what I consider in which I think the State considers now, the really basic issue in this case which is -- what is meant by the term fishing rights in Section 4?</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.032" offset="15351515">I wish to make it clear on behalf of the Federal Government that fishing rights that I espoused here, we do not think of vested or compensable as against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.140" offset="15395924">That is we don't think the Court has to decide this issue in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.474" offset="15413269">I just wish to make it clear so that there be no misapprehension as to position of the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3889.362" offset="15660805">What is our view of what a fishing right within the meaning of Section 4?</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.537" offset="15677524">Our feeling is that if say a permission, a license, a privilege, a right on actual fishing by or in behalf of Indians as Indians under the aegis of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.425" offset="15737083">Now, those are general words and I will try to fill them out with relation to the particular groups here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.835" offset="15766758">As Mr. Schifter has pointed out, from 1891, the Metlakatla's have been subject to the supervision and jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.264" offset="15804479">Both Congress and the President have made very clear that they have fishing rights in -- in their reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.459" offset="15829243">They are spelled out in the President's executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.158" offset="15848051">It's made very clear in the decision of this Court in the Alaska Pacific Fisheries case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.895" offset="15866964">It's assumed and confirmed by Congress in the various statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.483" offset="15889324">So these fishing rights come under a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.099" offset="15907819">They come under complex of federal statutes with relation to Metlakatla.</text>

            <text syncTime="4562.615" offset="18353821">And one of the important things that I would like to stress is that Congress was aware of the importance of fishing to these Indian communities and others in Alaska. That was a very important factor that Congress was aware of generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.062" offset="18403662">I think it was aware perhaps not specifically of -- of all the fishing by these Indian groups, certainly they aware of the Metlakatla of what they've been doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.834" offset="18454758">They -- I think Congress was aware the fact that in the Felix Cohen's handbook in 1940 and his handbook on Indian law published by the Interior Department, under this chapter on Alaska natives, Alaska Indians under the rubric fishing and hunting rights, he discusses this along with others that is -- I think the Attorney General will indic -- will talk, say that the statute is limited to certain specific ceiling rights which Congress gave to the Indians that very -- and natives at various times.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.083" offset="18579728">But what I want to point out is that in 1940, Felix Cohen in the authoritative handbook talking about fishing and hunting rights in Alaska for Alaska Indians, refer to these fish trap types of -- of commissions as part of the -- of the fishing rights of the Indians in Alaska as well as the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.327" offset="18648691">Now, Governor Heintzleman of Alaska who was the Governor in 1954 at a hearing and this is not spelled out in our brief and that's why I take time to mention it, Governor Heintzleman in Alaska -- of Alaska talked about fishing rights before congressional committee as rights which were exercised for a long time under used on occupation by the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.528" offset="18741478">He used the term fishing rights and it was quite clear from the context that he wasn't talking about a kind of right that you have to -- have a deed for or -- because he said there were no written papers indicating what fishing had been done by these Indians that you could find it out by -- by -- by evidence and proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.951" offset="18835205">Now, all these we think really add up to the fact that when Congress used the word fishing rights, it used in the sense of the fishing which was done by Indians as Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.580" offset="18881703">Now of course, we don't claim that every Indian in Alaska is controlled by the Federal Government because most of the Indians in Alaska who do fishing are not under aegis of the Federal Governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.718" offset="18930291">One of my colleagues pointed out to me if an Indian, who happens to be a drugstore (Inaudible) Alaska goes out fishing on Sunday, he of course is not under the control of the -- of the -- of the Interior Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.085" offset="18975744">Or if an Indian happens to be a member of a fishing crew in some other part of Alaska but he is not fishing as Indian.</text>

            <label>Mr. Avrum M. Gross</label>
            <text syncTime="5171.924" offset="20791045">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.990" offset="20811316">Mr. Justice Douglas pointed out early in the appellant's argument that the real question here is the interpretation of Section 4 of the Statehood Act and that Section 4 deprives Alaska of authority to regulate any Indian fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.005" offset="20879444">The real issue for this Court today is whether these appellants have fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.503" offset="20905357">Now, I don't believe this Court can decide that question without understanding what the regulatory scheme in Alaska was prior to the Statehood Act because all parties to this litigation are agreed that no rights were created in the Statehood Act, only rights were preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.557" offset="20981635">So the question is, what rights that Indians have prior to Statehood?</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.794" offset="21006503">Prior to 1924, regulation of the Alaska commercial fisheries was nearly non-existent although the power did exist in the Federal Government, but in 1924, Congress adopted the White Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.474" offset="21061256">Now, the White Act perhaps remains a model for most state conservation programs today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.034" offset="21083512">Under that Act, the Secretary of the -- or Secretary of Commerce was subsequently transferred to the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to do several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.041" offset="21123532">First of all, he was authorized to set up areas in Alaskan waters over any area in Alaska, over which the United States had jurisdiction through (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.358" offset="21164805">It sets these areas of any waters of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.554" offset="21181628">Now, once he set up these areas, he could regulate the fishing within them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.172" offset="21200018">By that I mean that he could prescribe methods, means, times of fishing, seasons of fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.085" offset="21231679">Now, under the White Act, traps were allowed in Alaska, but there's been confusion raised here and I want to clear it up as quickly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.171" offset="21272012">The appellants say that the Secretary of the Interior authorized them to use fish traps.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.530" offset="21297507">Now that is simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.050" offset="21307538">The Secretary of the Interior passed regulations which allowed anyone to use fish traps in a particular area, just as a particular any other type of equipment was authorized, nets, hook and line, anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.045" offset="21363545">Traps were one of the types of equipment which were authorized to be used in a particular area of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.845" offset="21386742">No particular community or person was ever authorized to use traps in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="5327.083" offset="21411715">I think that's crucial because -- because all through this litigation, I think the impression has been given that the Secretary specifically designated this community to use traps, he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.112" offset="21459780">Areas were permitted and these individuals used traps in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5343.941" offset="21479111">Now, in fact --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="5345.019" offset="21483499">And anyone else could do.</text>

            <label>Mr. Avrum M. Gross</label>
            <text syncTime="5346.834" offset="21490709">That's exactly correct Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.919" offset="21499068">In fact, the records show that the very traps which were used by Kake and Angoon in this litigation were actually used by the P.E. Harris Company prior to 1948 and 1950 in the exact place where they are now being fished today, so anyone could use them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.538" offset="21585481">Now, when we talk about a native fishery in Alaska, it's actually a misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.725" offset="21610245">In the commercial fisheries, there was no native fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.579" offset="21625710">The White Act made no distinctions between Alaskans, White Alaskans and Native Alaskans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.166" offset="21652041">This is quite reasonable if the Court will -- will think fishing is perhaps the only industry of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.519" offset="21673462">It certainly was back to turn of the century except for gold which is now extremely (Inaudible), but it was -- would have been impossible for people to come to the territory if they could not have fished on at least an equal basis with the natives that were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.831" offset="21730722">Now in this litigation, the natives aren't only claiming the right to fish on an equal basis with White citizens in Alaska, they're claiming it on a privilege basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.449" offset="21773145">But the White Act specifically said that no exclusive right of fishery shall be given to any group in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="5425.537" offset="21805537">And this Court held in Hynes against Grimes that that specific clause applied to natives as well as anybody else that no rights could be given to natives under the White Act, absolutely none.</text>

            <text syncTime="5441.239" offset="21868335">Did that provision of the White Act have any effect to cancel the earlier 1916 grant of exclusive fishing rights in these thousand foot -- 300,000 feet kilometer (Inaudible) and Metlakatla?</text>

            <text syncTime="5475.252" offset="22004381">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.513" offset="22009396">And I believe that the 1924 statement in the White Act which says that no citizen shall be denied the right to fish in Alaska, in any area where fishing is permitted by the Secretary of the Interior which is the last sentence of Section 1, may have will abolish the Metlakatla water reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.477" offset="22089331">I do not believe that it is necessary for the Court to hold that, to uphold Alaska's right to regulate the Metlakatla Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.926" offset="22115035">But I -- and I do raise the point that Congress may well have meant to exclude the Metlakatla Reservation which had -- it had specifically set up, but you do raise the point which may well be valid and it may well indeed have abolished the water reservation, the specific declaration of equal rights to all fishermen in all waters of Alaska.</text>

            <text syncTime="5522.798" offset="22194552">Is there anything in the legislative history that shows what Congress intended in that regard?</text>

            <label>Mr. Avrum M. Gross</label>
            <text syncTime="5528.673" offset="22218062">This is debated between Justice Rutledge in Hynes against Grimes Packing Company, seem to view that the legislative -- the legislative history of the White Act did imply that Congress meant to exclude the White Act from applications to validly created Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.161" offset="22292041">Now, the Court, the majority of the Court at that time disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5554.061" offset="22319626">It did say and I think the Hynes case is extremely important here, because -- and perhaps I can answer your question best by reviewing the two holdings of the cases that have been pointed out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5565.426" offset="22365080">Hynes said first of all that the Secretary for the President could reserve areas in Alaska for exclusive rights of fishing under the Wheeler-Howard Act, which was a later passed act than the White Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.297" offset="22428609">It also said that the White Act could not be used to protect those areas and it also held that the White Act could apply to those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5590.184" offset="22464136">Now, a number of things I think are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.281" offset="22472495">First of all, assuming that the area thereby set aside in the Hynes case became and exclusive right, it only became exclusive as to area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.411" offset="22520978">The Secretary was given full authority to regulate the means of fishing within the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.997" offset="22551385">Now, so you have this distinction, the areas retained but the regulation is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.171" offset="22576044">Now in Metlaktla, Metlakatla was established before the White Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.636" offset="22601958">Now, it may -- here, you get little interplay of two reservations created and an act between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.934" offset="22635081">The Act may well have cut off the first and yet, it's superseded by the second, but in any case the regulation -- the regu -- the regulatory authority of the White Act extends to those reservations, the regulation of the fishing within the reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.512" offset="22697462">This, the Hynes case did hold that the area could be set aside, but the means of fishing within it was subject to general regulatory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5658.536" offset="22737481">There was never any right to be free of general regulatory authority in any reservation in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.615" offset="22769873">Now, this then was the status of fishing prior to the Statehood Act and the Statehood Act reserved for state control, all Indian fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.260" offset="22820446">Now first of all, I want to make absolutely clear the position of the Statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="5683.845" offset="22838732">We will concede for argument that if Congress had wished to, it could have reserved the control of all Indian fishing to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5693.111" offset="22875826">The effect might well had been disastrous in Alaska, but it might well have done so, but Congress didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.595" offset="22905710">Congress only reserved Indian fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.337" offset="22920756">Those are the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.143" offset="22927966">It could have used the fishing but it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.757" offset="22942386">So then the question becomes, looking back into Alaskan history by the -- by the test laid down by this Court as to what constitutes Indian rights, whether Indians really had rights in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.717" offset="22994213">Well, this Court has already heard from the appellants in this case, and I refer now to Kake and Angoon that there is no treaty between the Indians of Kake and Angoon and the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5734.850" offset="23042800">It has also heard taken Angoon State that there is no reservation in Kake.</text>

            <text syncTime="5795.598" offset="23285739">Well, Section -- but what I -- what I wish to make clear Mr. Justice Whittaker is that rights have a -- have a defined meaning in Alaska and have defined meaning under -- under the terms, under the decisions of this Court and the term was not used in advisably.</text>
            <text syncTime="5810.880" offset="23346866">So I mean it's not a new concept of right. Now, there are no treaties and there are no reservations for the Kake and Angoon Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.148" offset="23387930">Now, this Court has recognized that -- that there are two basic kinds of Indian title recognized and unrecognized Indian title.</text>
            <text syncTime="5829.093" offset="23419695">As there are no reservations and no treaties, and no statute creating rights for Kake and Angoon specifically, we don't have recognized rights and Kake and Angoon freely admit this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5840.455" offset="23465148">So the question is where they have unrecognized rights and those would be of course rights protected against third parties, in this case the State of Alaska being the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.339" offset="23504750">Now recognized, unrecognized rights could be broken down in two categories again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5855.324" offset="23524707">Those rights which are preserved or aboriginal rights, historical Indian title it's called or those rights which are created by statute, a temporary right which does not create compensation, a right to compensation upon termination, but which is nonetheless a right against third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.338" offset="23592730">Now, we are here on a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.579" offset="23613733">Now, aboriginal title is normally a question of fact, but we contend to this Court that as a matter of law, these Indians has no aboriginal title and cannot have aboriginal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="5891.105" offset="23667754">Now, in buttressing this claim, I wish to point out to the Court the last two sentences of Section 1 of the White Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.716" offset="23706206">You will find that printed in full in our brief in the appendix on page 53 and 54 sentences that we are particularly interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5915.134" offset="23763884">Now, first of all, the Secretary was empowered to regulate fisheries all through Alaska and it said that when the Secretary did regulate fisheries, his regulations could not be made exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.772" offset="23822503">They must apply to all equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.896" offset="23834937">Now, this Court recognized in Hynes that it could not be exclusive as to natives too.</text>
            <text syncTime="5937.806" offset="23854582">It is specifically applied to native as well as others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5942.224" offset="23872240">So in short, this part, this sentence is exclusive -- no exclusive right forbade the Secretary of the Interior through his regulations to protect any aboriginal rights which existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.666" offset="23926053">He had through his regulations, to open up any area in Alaska, if it was opened up to natives, it had to be opened up to Whites as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.646" offset="23957922">So he could not protect aboriginal claim, any exclusive right of possession of natives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5968.882" offset="23978924">He could not protect it with that, but the next sentence, the next sentence of the White Act is most crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.310" offset="24012570">There it says that no citizens shall be denied the right to fish in any area of water in Alaska where -- where fishing is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.286" offset="24048515">Now, here is the clearest and most unequivocal statement that could made that no person shall have an exclusive right in waters of Alaska, that whether he be native or White or corporation or individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="5999.213" offset="24100237">He has no exclusive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6000.998" offset="24107342">If he had one, it is now gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6003.971" offset="24119254">Everyone can fish there and everyone did fish there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6009.419" offset="24141093">I wish -- I can't make this too strong for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.851" offset="24158751">These very natives, Kake and Angoon purchased their sites, purchased their cannery from a private company which was fishing in the very area they now -- now claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.729" offset="24198248">All through Alaska, canneries are set up on the biggest Salmon streams quite obviously and these are very areas where these native tribes or native people fished in past years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6035.048" offset="24243597">Again quite obviously, people clustered where the fish were.</text>
            <text syncTime="6042.246" offset="24272332">Now, in regard to whether aboriginal rights exists such as Kake and Angoon claim, I should like to make reference to the Solicitor General's opinion which Kake and Angoon cite in their brief as holding, that no -- that aboriginal fishing rights do exist in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="6064.967" offset="24363238">I should like to take -- to take this into consideration in conjunction with the claim in the Metlakatla brief which we agree, with which we agree that this Solicitor's opinion should be given some weight in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.261" offset="24412453">We recognized this, his interpretation of what the White Act meant for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6083.094" offset="24435754">Well, first of all, the Solicitor's opinion held that aboriginal fishing rights do exist in Alaska in spite of the White Act, but certain things are curious.</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.676" offset="24486118">First of all, from 1924 to 1942, no action was ever taken by the Solicitor to enforce these aboriginal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6105.016" offset="24523421">In 1942, he gave his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6107.637" offset="24533870">The 1942 to 1959 again, exactly nothing was ever done to claim aboriginal rights except one thing, a bill was introduced by the Solicitor in Congress which would have protected what the solicitor considered aboriginal -- Department of Interior considered aboriginal rights and that bill was rejected, and you will find that in the Kake and Angoon brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6131.716" offset="24630209">But most important is the opinion of the Solicitor on why he thought there were aboriginal rights in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="6140.051" offset="24663542">He considered the last sentence of the White Act, the one I have already discussed with this Court regarding the exclusive that -- that every citizen must be allowed to fish in an area where any fishing is permitted and he said, “It's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6157.694" offset="24734177">This sentence certainly does look like it extinguishes aboriginal rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6162.852" offset="24754761">But he said and the Court must remember that this was 1942 and prior to this Court's decision in the Tee-Hit-Ton case, “but” the solicitor said, “That taking by Congress of aboriginal title is forbidden under the Fifth Amendment, and therefore we cannot read this Act as unconstitutional interpretation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6184.820" offset="24842637">Therefore, the Solicitor avoided that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6188.350" offset="24856743">This Court of course subsequently in 1954 I believe it was in the Tee-Hit-Ton case held specifically the opposite, that it was not indeed unconstitutional for Congress to terminate aboriginal title in anyway saw fit, without any liability arising whatsoever unless Congress saw fit to give that liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.558" offset="24941589">So I merely point this out to show two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="6212.283" offset="24952456">First, the opinion of the Department of the Interior as expressed through its actions in Alaska has consistently been that no aboriginal title exists and second that even in his written opinion, the Solicitor recognized that there was no aboriginal title in Alaska and would have held so except for the fact that he believed this interpretation would have been unconstitutional, and that assumption has been proven incorrect by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.832" offset="25066663">Now so much for aboriginal title, there also remains the question as to whether any other kinds of rights were created for these Indians unrecognized rights, but rights nonetheless.</text>

            <text syncTime="6459.859" offset="25942810">They took historical acts and got as far as I think it was 190 -- it's in -- before 1920 I believe in which Congress reserved from the public domain the Tongass Natural Forest in Southeastern Alaska which comprises all the land which is involved here and even more and the Court of Claims felt that this Reservation was inconsistent with the Indians' exclusive right of possession and they further pointed out that the Indians had lost their fishing rights connected to the land, Mr. Justice Whittaker.</text>
