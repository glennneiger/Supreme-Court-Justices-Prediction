            <text syncTime="61.612" offset="349811">The facts are more involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.944" offset="359111">In June of 1960 at the age of 25, petitioner, Michael Zipkin from Kansas City, graduated from the University of Missouri Law School.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.953" offset="399235">He had previously been investigated twice as to his moral character by regional bar committees and twice found to be of good moral character, once, when he filed his law student registration form and, later, when he filed to take the Missouri Bar Examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.824" offset="470706">He took the Missouri Bar in June of 1960 but did not pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.065" offset="495679">While the papers were being graded, however, a complaint was raised against him and, when the results of the bar examination were announced, petitioner was advised that if he wanted to take a second bar exam, the Board would have to inquire further as to his character.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.903" offset="562970">The petitioner advised the Board that he did want to take a second examination and the Board advised him that the hearing would be held and that the hearing would be particularly directed to the questions of whether he had held himself out as an attorney in connection with a certain divorce litigation between a Mr. and Mrs. Baurichter in Columbia, Missouri and whether he had influenced or attempted to influence witnesses at the hearing before the State Board of Healing Arts of a Dr. Freeman, a Columbia, Missouri psychiatrist.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.750" offset="758366">He failed the bar exam and this has to do only as to his moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.260" offset="780413">The State Board of Healing Arts hearing on Dr. Freeman was held in June of 1960 and resulted in Dr. Freeman's license being revoked for unprofessional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.177" offset="836106">Petitioner's hearing was held in Columbia on October of 1960, as scheduled.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.750" offset="858363">The witnesses who testified were six, the Board subpoenaed plus Mrs. Baurichter, the individual involved in the divorce litigation, and petitioner, himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.866" offset="906846">Carl Sapp, the first Board witness, a Columbia, Missouri attorney, testified that he'd known petitioner casually for six or seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.268" offset="944462">That, while he was not acquainted with his reputation, “his conversation and conduct at the times that I have seen and talked to him have been above reproach and he has conducted himself as a gentleman in my presence” and, Mr. Sapp said that he would sign a character affidavit for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.469" offset="1013217">Mr. Sapp also testified that he represented Dr. Freeman at his hearing, that he never requested petitioner to interview witnesses or obtain statements and that, to his knowledge, petitioner had never done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.965" offset="1071208">Mr. Sapp said the petitioner never played a part in the Freeman hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.520" offset="1093465">Mr. Sapp also testified regarding events related to a divorce proceeding filed by his client, Mrs. Baurichter, who was a patient of Dr. Freeman's against her husband --</text>

            <label>Mr. Heywood H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="265.855" offset="1166817">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.884" offset="1178937">Mr. Stap -- Sapp stated that there was considerable community feeling in Columbia by reason of the Freeman hearing and the Baurichter divorce proceeding and that, in June of 1960, there were rumors all over the community about Dr. Freeman and Ada Margaret Baurichter, most of which were believed whether there was evidence or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.492" offset="1257305">Mr. Sapp said that the issue of petitioner's character at this law examiner's hearing was very much tied in with the community feeling toward Dr. Freeman and Mrs. Baurichter.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.629" offset="1305893">The second Board witness, Mr. Baurichter testified that he'd known petitioner probably a year, that he had been on friendly terms with him, and had good relations with his friends, that petitioner had been a guest in the Baurichter home, and that he saw no reason to see otherwise than that petitioner was a person of good reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.540" offset="1405576">Mr. Baurichter also testified that he was estranged from his wife, that petitioner and Mrs. Baurichter had come out to the home at the time Mrs. Baurichter moved out since petitioner helped her move some furniture, that petitioner later came out with Mrs. Baurichter to take an inventory which Mr. Sapp wanted and that, on this latter occasion, petitioner made the statement that “I think I know a little more about it than you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.776" offset="1506513">I am a lawyer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="353.514" offset="1517380">Mr. Baurichter's hired hand, James Earl Grant, the third Board witness, testified to the same effect as to the attorney representation charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.384" offset="1556877">It can be noted at this point, however, that Mrs. Baurichter and petitioner both denied that any such attorney representation was made, testifying to the effect that petitioner said “I possibly know more of the law than you do” or words to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.662" offset="1626049">In any event, this testimonial variance became inconsequential because the Board of Law Examiners in their opinion expressly found that petitioner was not disqualified on the ground that he had held himself out as an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.960" offset="1687176">The fourth Board witness was Professor Edmond R. Anderson.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.863" offset="1822804">Professor Anderson testified that he had known petitioner over two years, that he knew him as a student and socially, that he thought petitioner met the requirements for admittance to the Missouri Bar and the petitioner was fit to be a member of the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.547" offset="1881527">Professor Anderson also testified that petitioner's reputation for character and truthfulness was good and that everybody that I know whose judgment I would respect around here has also thought well of Michael Zipkin and, in Kansas City where I understand he lives now, former students of mine speak well of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.690" offset="1958118">Professor Anderson also testified that his wife had been a patient of Dr. Freeman and that Dr. Freeman's hearing before the State Board of Healing Arts was widely publicized and discussed in conversations and by rumors in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.985" offset="2019349">The fifth Board witness was Dean Joseph Covington of the Missouri Law School.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.845" offset="2038784">He testified that he knew petitioner only in his capacity a dean -- as dean, that he was not familiar with his reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.899" offset="2070967">That, in regard to the requirements of character and fitness, he had no knowledge that would prevent petitioner from being a member of the Bar and that, as far as the law school's records indicated, petitioner was -- had good grades and good background.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.908" offset="2131048">Mr. Baurichter testified she'd known petitioner approximately a year-and-a half, that she became acquainted with him when they were both patients of Dr. Freeman and participated in certain group activities that Dr. Freeman stimulated, that petitioner was very highly spoken of, and that she would say his reputation was good.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.675" offset="2222059">Michael J. Trombley, the sixth Board witness, was the main one against petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.917" offset="2247032">He had received his law degree in Missouri in February of 1960, the semester before petitioner graduated.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.937" offset="2279111">And he testified that he first became acquainted with petitioner when they were freshmen in law school, that they were then on friendly terms, close friends at one time, that they talked a lot and did things together, and that they had been in Dr. Freeman's home along with Mrs. Trombley, the witness' wife, and the Bauritchters, and that they have not associated together, petitioner and Trombley, as they once did because, well, primarily over this Dr. Freeman deal.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.188" offset="2788080">Trombley testified that the break between petitioner and himself had nothing to do with petitioner's character that it was more his association with Dr. Freeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.031" offset="2839489">Trombley further testified that he and his wife employed a housekeeper by the name of Irene Werhey who lived in an apartment in their basement and, yes, who was also a patient of Dr. Freeman and had been for over a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.026" offset="2891525">That, while she was under treatment from him, she was informed that she was to appear against him at this hearing of his, that she was very confused and asked Trombley what she should do, and Trombley told her that she should tell the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.245" offset="2956309">Irene, the housekeeper, then went to Dr. Freeman, according to Trombley's testimony, and told Dr. Freeman that she was going to be called at his hearing, that she was going to tell the truth, and Dr. Freeman told her that that would not be wise, this, all according to the testimony of witness Trombley.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.058" offset="3039587">Trombley testified that, within a few days after that and before the Freedman hearing, a call came in from petitioner that Mrs. Trombley first answered the telephone and that he answered a few minutes or a few seconds later on an extension and that everybody was speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.557" offset="3101550">Trombley testified as to the substance of the conversation as follows and, here, with the Court's permission, I'll read from page 10 of the petitioner's brief where the record is quoted.“</text>
            <text syncTime="761.594" offset="3149720">Sir, Mr. Zipkin was talking to my wife when I picked up the receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.991" offset="3167378">He mentioned the fact that he was helping Dr. Freeman with his case and that things were looking well and that there was some new material or something new had come up but there was a problem in that Irene, I mean, Mrs. Werhey was in a truth-telling mood and that she felt -- he felt that my wife and I should meet with he and Dr. Freeman to see what could be done about Mrs. Werhey.”</text>
            <text syncTime="786.146" offset="3247940">Question: “Now, was there any further conversation other than that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="789.982" offset="3263300">“Well, I think that this time, I interjected and my wife had been doing all the talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.242" offset="3280332">I said ‘are you trying to intimidate a witness?</text>
            <text syncTime="796.513" offset="3289422">What is going on?'</text>
            <text syncTime="798.199" offset="3296214">He said ‘I think it would be better for everybody all the way around if we met and decided what to do with Mrs. Werhey.'”</text>
            <text syncTime="807.309" offset="3332577">Trombley testified that he gratuitously represented two of the witnesses at the Freeman hearing, including Ms. Irene, the housekeeper but that, after the telephone call by petitioner, he had no further conversations with petitioner with reference to Dr. Freeman's hearing, that he had no knowledge that petitioner ever approached Irene personally either before or after the telephone conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.454" offset="3445217">And, in fact, in response to a Board member's question as to what in particular caused him to accuse petitioner of attempting to influence a witness, Trombley replied “I sort of maybe jumped to conclusions, but you take the preceding incident that I discussed that Irene had told me about and connected it with this incident.”</text>
            <text syncTime="856.911" offset="3531003">When asked about petitioner's reputation for voracity and morality, Trombley replied “I don't think it is particularly good.”</text>
            <text syncTime="865.366" offset="3564857">After stating he had made up his mind to this during the last few months of their relationship and that he had no opinion in 1959, Trombley admitted, upon further questioning, that he had been a character witness for petitioner in his 1959 divorce case and that he had then testified that petitioner's reputation in the community for voracity and morality was good.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.951" offset="3663182">The final witness was petitioner, himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.960" offset="3675199">He testified that he was introduced to Dr. Freeman by the Trombleys in December of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.432" offset="3705083">That he, thereafter, became a patient of Dr. Freeman, that he went to him because of his mari -- of his own marital difficulties and because he was having difficulty concentrating on his studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.718" offset="3758268">Petitioner testified that, at that time, “Trombley was the closest friend I ever had that I considered Mr. and Mrs. Trombley to be very close.”</text>
            <text syncTime="923.762" offset="3798392">Petitioner and Trombley, petitioner testified, sat together in the law classes, helped each other with their examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.962" offset="3827231">Trombley had been a witness at petitioner's divorce proceeding and Trombley had been instrumental in getting petitioner a place to live at the house of the legal fraternity to which petitioner did not belong after his divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.971" offset="3879267">As to what precipitated the rift between them, petitioner stated that Trombley developed an almost fanatical hatred of Dr. Freeman, that when the Trombleys separated from Dr. Freeman, petitioner did his best to maintain his friendship both with the Trombleys and Dr. Freeman but that, gradually, this became impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.497" offset="3949380">That, every time he went over to the Trombleys even to comfort him after Trombley's bar exam, Trombley would go and do -- and harangued about Dr. Freeman, and that the telephone conversation just ended anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.025" offset="4007476">Petitioner testified that “Trombley just got mad at me because I was seeing Dr. Freeman.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.410" offset="4104965">Petitioner testified that he called the Trombley home about a month before the Freeman hearing, that he did so as a friendly gesture because he had heard that Irene, the housekeeper in their home, was going to testify against Dr. Freeman at his hearing, that Mrs. Trombley had once told petitioner that they, the Trombleys, couldn't stand all this gossip about Dr. Freeman and that he just called them to tell them something he didn't know they knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.204" offset="4216142">Petitioner denied that he used any words such as “truth-telling mood” and stated that there was no intimidation involved in the phone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.214" offset="4252191">With both of the Trombleys yelling at him, however, and Mr. Trombley accusing him of attempting to intimidate a witness, petitioner testified that he said “well, if you want to get together with me and talk about this or with me and Dr. Freeman at a later date, I'll do so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.984" offset="4323349">Petitioner testified that he did not talk with Dr. Freeman or anyone about making the call to the Trombleys, that he never even told Dr. Freeman that he did so and that he never talked to Irene about anything connected with the Freeman hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.670" offset="4402030">In February of 1961, the Board of Law Examiners filed their opinion that petitioner was not a person of good moral character and should not be allowed to take a second bar examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.487" offset="4445288">One of the five Board members dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.592" offset="4457723">The Board threw out the attorney representation charge, finding that there was no substantial evidence to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.906" offset="4486980">On the witness intimidation charge, however, the Board found against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.862" offset="4514774">The Board said, I am referring to page 17 of petitioner's brief, based on the record of the hearing before the Board, therefore, it is the finding of the Board that applicant, Michael Zipkin did attempt to influence the testimony of Irene Werhey by approaching Mr. and Mrs. Trombley with the suggestions as testified to by Trombley, that applicant, Michael Zipkin, was not telling the truth in his testimony before the Board with regard to what he said in the telephone conversation to Mr. and Mrs. Trombley and as to whether or not he knew when he telephoned them that Mrs. Werhey was going to testify as to sexual relations with Freeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.425" offset="4661060">The Board summarized the testimony regarding petitioner's character and reputation and comment, here again on page 18, “even though it might be said that the evidence preponderates in favor of the reputation of the applicant for good character, yet, the general reputation would have to yield in deciding this matter to the specific act and facts with regard to the telephone conversation above set out as the determinative factor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.383" offset="4784880">Petitioner filed a motion for judicial review in the Missouri Supreme Court urging, among other things, a violation of his constitutional rights in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, but the Missouri Supreme Court, without oral argument, summarily affirmed the Board's order.</text>
