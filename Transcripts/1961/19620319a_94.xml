            <text syncTime="18.377" offset="176880">Mr. Come.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="20.165" offset="183986">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.633" offset="209899">This case is likewise here on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit and presents an issue similar to that in Walton, the higher case, namely whether the court has grossly exceeded its reviewing power and setting aside for the findings of fact in an unfair labor practice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.006" offset="339362">Here, the Board found that the respondent unlawfully refused to bargain with the Teamsters, the certified bargaining agent of its employees, that this unfair labor practice was the cause of a strike which in ensued so that 274 strikers were entitled to be returned to their jobs with back pay, notwithstanding intervening replacement, and that respondent engaged in various acts of interference to restrain in addition in the violation of Section 8 (a) (1) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.341" offset="532773">The court below set aside the refusal to bargain findings which in turn upset the finding that the strike was an unfair labor practice strike because in its view, the trial examiner's credibility determinations could not be accepted and then it proceeded to reevaluate and minimize the 8 (a) (1) Act cavity and then decided not even to enforce that part of the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.129" offset="703927">Now, in Walton, we attempted to show that the court below erred in rejecting inferences drawn by the Board though on the entire record, they had rational support.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.632" offset="785951">Here, we submit, the Court has made an even more basic incursion into the Board's fact finding function by setting aside terminations as to the credibility of witnesses which were neither irrational nor contrary to the view of the court below based on an improper standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.677" offset="906115">The facts can be briefly set forth as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.927" offset="931088">The union was certified in February of 1957, and bargaining negotiations were carried on sporadically from April through November, but the parties were unable to reach an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.607" offset="1001827">On December 4, Union Negotiator, Wingate and Production Manager, Stephenson, after a private off the record meeting, appeared to be not far apart on the union's latest proposal and another formal negotiating session was set for December 18th.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.764" offset="1118438">Now, that is a critical date because the Board finds a refusal to bargain on and after that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.683" offset="1166085">At the off the record meeting with Stephenson on December 4th, they agreed to set up a resumed negotiations on December 18th.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.408" offset="1216972">On December 12th and 13th, the Florida Citrus belt was hit by a severe freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.303" offset="1260544">At December 18, the meeting opens and Union Organizer, Wingate, asked for the company's views on the union's latest proposals, which as I've indicated, appeared to be acceptable to Stephenson.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.850" offset="1346748">The company attorney said that there was no point in discussing them since they were completely different from anything that have ever been discussed up to then and besides the company wanted to talk about the effects of the freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.668" offset="1422085">Wingate thereupon accused the company of strolling and threatened a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.016" offset="1459388">The company representatives at that point terminated the meeting, indicating that they would not respond to the pressure of the strike and it might do the employee some good to get it out of their system.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.939" offset="1539114">Despite frequent requests by the union, there was no further meeting until January 28, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.324" offset="1576626">The parties got together after a short meeting that broke up with the company indicating that it would get in touch with the union for further meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.169" offset="1648097">No further word was received from the company and no future meeting was selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.309" offset="1688639">In the meantime, a decertification petition was circulated in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.328" offset="1748720">The company allowed the employees to circulate it on company time.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.206" offset="1788217">Majority of the employee signed it, repudiating the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.785" offset="1810474">As soon as the company receives that they tell the union that they will no longer bargain with them because the union has lost its majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.943" offset="1867107">Now, the Board found that on and after December 18, 1957, the company refused to bargain in good faith with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.201" offset="1928129">That what it was doing was exploiting the emergency created by the freeze in this Florida Citrus belt as an excuse for delaying negotiations while in the meantime, it was carrying on a course of conduct which I will elude to later for the purpose of undermining the support for the union so that when February 8 came around which was the end of the certification year, the company could withdraw recognition from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.723" offset="2102314">Now, to support this finding that there was bad faith between bargaining and a consorted effort to undermine the union on and after December 18th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.883" offset="2194892">This finding is supported basically on the testimony of the employee Holly and Union Organizer, Wingate whom the Board and the trial examiner credited.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.921" offset="2279006">These credibility findings, the court below upset and that is the nub of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.260" offset="2328430">We submit that that Court was unjustified in setting aside those credibility findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.867" offset="2370853">It implied, and indeed, in doing so, it exceeded its reviewing power under Section 10 (e) of the Act because they were based on reasonable considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.451" offset="2425187">They were well within the examiner's province as the presiding officer at the hearing and the bias that the Court attributed to the examiner was based upon statements in his intermediate report which we submit do not reasonably have the significance that the Court attributed to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.338" offset="2552769">Now, as to Holly, because he is the key, one of the key witnesses here.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="622.820" offset="2594670">Is Holly the employee or the organizer?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="624.578" stopTime="647.777">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="624.578" offset="2601671">Holly was the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.648" offset="2609925">He was an old time employee who had been active in the administration of the former union which had previously represented the employees before the Teamsters came on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.080" offset="2667708">I'll continue tomorrow.</text>
