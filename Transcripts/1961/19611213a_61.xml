            <text syncTime="13.836" offset="158699">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.333" offset="172701">This appeal presents a question of whether the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution denies a municipality the right to tax the direct sale of natural gas to industrial consumers within the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.830" offset="230693">The seller being, an interstate pipeline company, but the seller itself making the deliveries direct to the plant of the purchaser and admittedly the situs of the sale lying within the city levying the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.194" offset="284191">The appellate, United Gas Pipeline Company occupies here the unique position of a taxpayer arguing for the validity of a tax levied upon it rather than against the validity of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.429" offset="329122">That situation is brought about by the fact that United Gas paid the City of Mobile, the taxes for the three years in question and then sued two of its industrial customers to whom these direct deliveries are made for their contractual reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.553" offset="389622">Under theF contract, customers were obligated to reimburse to United in his subsequent levied sales, occupation, privilege or the types of taxes and this tax was subsequently levied and the liability of the appellees to United Gas is admitted save only on the question of the validity of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.218" offset="472273">The case was litigated in the District Court solely on the question of whether the Commerce Clause was infringed upon by the levy of this direct tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.907" offset="511039">The District Court held that the delivery to the -- directly to the consumer on the sale completed within the City of Mobile was separable from commerce and sustained the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.589" offset="553775">The Court of Appeals took the view that the tax on the privilege of selling within the City of Mobile was the equivalent of a tax on the preceding interstate transportation and struck the tax down as an improper burden upon interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.672" offset="898069">The orange lines are the lines of Mobile Gas Service Corporation, the local distributor which has no connection with United Gas except that it purchases its gas at wholesale from United.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.860" offset="1062849">Now, the history of the direct sales is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.286" offset="1080508">Prior to 1954, these industries purchased their gas requirements from the local distributor, Mobile Gas Service Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.715" offset="1114258">Because of the rate problems, rates -- those rates being subject to administration by the Federal Power Commission in order to assure a more stable price, the industries negotiated with United Gas for direct purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.154" offset="1179982">Under the National Gas Act, sales for resale, that is sales to the local distributor was subject to the Federal Power whereas direct sales to the ultimate consumer are not so subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.655" offset="1225958">And so in 1954, all seven of these industrial contracts were assigned by the local distributor, Mobile Gas Service Corporation to United Gas Pipeline Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.527" offset="1269530">United Gas immediately contracted with the local distributor to continue to make the distribution through their local distribution system, to read the meters, to do the accounting, to send the bills and to collect for the gas.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Dixie Beggs</label>
            <text syncTime="309.639" offset="1341942">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.067" offset="1343613">They're taxed under the statute now on the local consumers, Mobile Gas Service Corporation distributes to all of the commercial and industrial consumers in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.886" offset="1378931">And they pay this 3% tax on 40,000 to 50,000 consumers of theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.336" offset="1404740">Under the Natural Gas Act and under the decisions of this Court, United Gas pays no tax on its sales for resale to the local distributor but the local distributor has paid the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.721" offset="1450297">If the Court of Appeals' decision is upheld, United Gas will be in the position of being able to make direct sales to consumers, free of any tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.331" offset="1488645">The absurdity we submit, as we conceive of that the position is that if that's true as to seven industries, why not ten, why not 2, why not all 50,000 customers within the city of Mobile?</text>
            <text syncTime="358.094" offset="1535770">They'd like all be assigned from the indirect purchase to the local distributor over to direct purchases from United Gas Pipeline Company and escape entirely the 3% of sales tax if it be that the sale and the distribution within the City of Mobile to the direct consumer is to be exempted from the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.598" offset="1617795">Your Honors would observe that from this -- following this paper transfer in 1954, the local customers who would -- the industrial consumers whose purchases from the local distributor would have unquestionably been subject to the tax, but who would like to escape the tax since they buy from United Direct rather from -- rather from the local distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.266" offset="1696475">Your Honors would observe that they still get their gas through the same pipes.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.814" offset="1714657">It's read through the same meters.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.881" offset="1722911">It's service by the same crews.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.106" offset="1731793">The accounting is kept right in the same office in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.126" offset="1743914">The bills go out from the Mobile office.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.521" offset="1753422">The checks in payment go back to the Mobile office and then back to the Mobile bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.792" offset="1770559">So the whole transaction is consummated within the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.504" offset="1781426">There's no dispute and it is conceded that the size of the sale is within the City of Mobile.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.050" offset="1843597">But -- prior to the 1954 transfer of this tax, as I've already said, it was not even authorized at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.702" offset="1866167">This tax was levied from the first time in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.027" offset="1879437">The local distributor has not contested and he pays it and of course either directly or indirectly, passes it on to his customers, and United Gas paid it for the three years in question and two of the industries denied the obligation to reimburse.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.558" offset="1925622">Not because the contract doesn't require it, if it is a valid tax, they defend it solely on the validity of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.859" offset="1970761">We should point out that the only tax reach that the City of Mobile undertakes to make against United and that United disputes, is on these sales direct to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.246" offset="2020394">United transports into the City of Mobile vast quantities of gas, free of this tax because it is sold at wholesale for resale by the local distributor and under the Natural Gas Act and the decisions of this Court, the sale for resale is that -- that interstate commerce but the sale of the direct consumer is not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.763" offset="9226428">I think I can come to grips immediately with the problem that appears to bother the court and state -- I can state unequivocally and possibly understandably that we contend the court was exactly right in its analysis of this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.846" offset="9298735">I submit to Your Honors that it is quite evident from the reading of the ordinance itself and that -- that it is broader than one that imposes a tax based on the sales measured by gross receipts which from hearing the argument from my opponents this morning and browsing their briefs, I take to be their fundamental argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.973" offset="9387238">I submit that if you turn to the ordinance, which begins at 80 -- page 83 of this record, it is an outright requirement that one must satisfy the condition set forth therein to conduct a business of any nature it said so on page 83 under a sub-Arabic 2 and they say that -- reading the introduction first, we're paraphrasing, “The following is hereby declared to be the schedule of licenses for the year beginning January 1, 1955 and so on, then it says, for keeping, engaging and/or carrying on a business of any nature offering merchandize for sale, soliciting orders or making deliveries of any merchandise and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.045" offset="9607502">Now, it seems to me that it is quite evident from this that we submit to the Court that it is the purpose of this ordinance to have it apply to every person whatever located, if he's engaged in or doing any of the acts there specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.464" offset="9681272">Now, appellant would have us adhere or attend only to Section 193 of that ordinance which appears after omissions on page 84 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="4937.542" offset="19853563">First, answering the quantitative distinction question that was asked upon which Mr. White undertook to make a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.034" offset="19879476">That question has been passed on by this Court itself in one of the early cases in Pennsylvania Gas Company versus Public Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.308" offset="19912600">The Court held that the pipeline company that pipes the gas into the State and sold it to residences and factories within the State was subject to state regulation because the business was local in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.115" offset="19963800">In the subsequent case of Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company, the pipeline company sought to exclude its large bulk sales to Anchor Hocking or very large industry on the theory that the Pennsylvania Gas case made local only the small sales, but this Court pointed out that the opinion in the Pennsylvania Gas case that requires it -- does not require to be so limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.008" offset="20071424">On the contrary, emphasis may rather be placed on effect that both situations involved sales to ultimate consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.539" offset="20097546">Anchor Hocking being just as clearly in that category is that factories and residences served in the -- in the Pennsylvania Gas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.025" offset="20127431">Both involved gas sold to the ultimate consumers so that the quantitative test has already been before the Court and the test is, if the transaction is a sale to the ultimate consumer, it's local in character and is subject to both the state -- state power to regulate and the state power to tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="5050.681" offset="20306108">If United -- if United was transporting the gas of ABC Gas Company for half, Spector Motor Company was holding free then the whole transaction would be interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.022" offset="20355427">The movement was a pick it up in Texas and then putting down in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.792" offset="20370578">That part is free of any tax and we put in -- there has been no effort tax at all but the Court of Appeal seems to think there has.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.376" offset="20392835">But what United Pipeline did was got owner to bring in the commodity but it owned the commodity and at the end of the journey it says, now having brought here, we've got the right to sell free of any tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.785" offset="20438497">So there's the distinction but Spector Motor Service says, the carrier that picks up and puts down for hire, the commodity of the third party, sure its interstate commerce from picking up to the putting down but where the carrier owns the commodity and he tries to stretch the umbrella out over the sale at the end, he's invaded the local field and it's subject to local regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="5274.799" offset="21202526">That provision in Section 15 it says that you can have 60 days free and then pay based on current year sales hasn't an application here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5342.669" offset="21474095">I would like also to point out that the State of Alabama Supreme Court has passed on similar state enactments and in Southern Natural Gas which came to this Court, the tax was upheld because there were sales direct to industries there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.343" offset="21532714">In the other two appearances of similar tax cases before the Alabama Supreme Court, they held that interstate commerce was involved because the only sales was sales for resale to the local distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.693" offset="21570121">But in Southern Natural Gas case, we had a -- a factual situation quite comparable to this to where the sales where there are six to seven subsidiaries of the Tennessee Court of iron company and the state graduated franchise tax was upheld because that was found to be a local business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.972" offset="21635218">And this Court said again upholding the tax which had been ties through upon by the Alabama Supreme Court said, “We had occasion in East Ohio Gas Company to consider the distinction between the transportation of gas into a state and the furnishing of gas so transported to consumers within the State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5400.426" offset="21705122">That is the distinction which makes this tax on the privilege of furnishing it to the consumer who buys at his burner tips, who pays for it and the city where he does the consuming.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.247" offset="21756322">He gets it under the streets of the city, under the police protection of the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.638" offset="21769906">That makes this the local event that is separable from commerce, the sale to the ultimate consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.169" offset="21796028">The interstate transportation is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.721" offset="21802297">There's been a transfer of possession, the transfer of title.</text>
