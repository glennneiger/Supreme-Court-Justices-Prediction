            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 21, Mario Dibella, Petitioner, versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.259" offset="176358">Mr. Lewis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerome Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="19.349" offset="180746">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.329" offset="200704">This is a search and seizure case which is before this Court on certiorari to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.798" offset="230588">The lower court affirmed an order of the District Court which denied a motion to suppress which had been made prior to the filing of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.159" offset="271966">Now, every search and seizure case is decided upon its own particular facts, more particularly, the total atmosphere of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.567" offset="309687">The conduct of arresting officer's prior to and at the time of the arrest must be taken in consideration to determine the reasonableness of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.937" offset="355140">Now, the facts in our case are rather unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.042" offset="371545">Originally, an application for a search warrant was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.523" offset="397458">The petitioner was arrested in his apartment in the evening on a five months old invalid warrant of arrest and then a search was conducted as an instance thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.908" offset="450957">The court below --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="87.605" stopTime="89.560">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="87.605" offset="453778">What was the invalidity of the warrant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_lewis" startTime="89.560" stopTime="492.482">
            <label>Mr. Jerome Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="89.560" offset="461615">That the complaint did not state sufficient facts to constitute probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.239" offset="484289">The Court of Appeals so-held and the government does not contest it.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.330" offset="500694">The court below held that since the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe that there was a violation of the narcotics law, therefore, under the Narcotic Control Act, the arrest was lawful and the search, as an incident thereto, was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.774" offset="570493">However, I respectfully submit to Your Honors that if the judgment of the lower court be affirmed, the narcotics agents can largely ignore the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.518" offset="617409">They can enter a suspect's home irrespective of the time of night or day upon reasonable ground to believe that a suspect had committed a crime no matter when the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.099" offset="663803">In our particular case, it was six months before the arrest was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.603" offset="681775">And, in the absence of special and necessitous circumstances, to whi -- more namely, that the contraband was going to be destroyed or that the suspect was fleeing or likely to flee and also taking into consideration the fact that this was a private dwelling and not a movable vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.838" offset="766725">And, where it clearly appears, as in our case, that the narcotics agents had more than ample time to obtain a search warrant, six months, there is no evidence adduced by the government that the agents, at the time or prior to the arrest, had reasonable ground to believe that the petitioner was committing a crime nor did they see him commit a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.673" offset="870066">This would permit, in effect, the arresting officer to bypass the magistrate to become the judicial officer, the arresting officer, and the one conducting the search, and I most respectfully submit to Your Honors that this would be a dangerous amalgamation of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.258" offset="944358">Now, Congress, in enacting the Narcotic Control Act, was particularly concerned about those emergent circumstances where, if the agent had to obtain a warrant, the suspect would flee or the contraband would be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.676" offset="1006111">And, as we read the remarks by the senators and the congressmen concerning this particular bit of legislation and the reports of the various committees, that's what they were concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.276" offset="1056475">They didn't want to put the narcotics agents in a select class above and distinct and apart from all other agents, but they recognize it and I recognize it, too, that if they -- if an agent had to go to a magistrate when a man was hawking his narcotics on the street, of course, it would be absurd and ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.547" offset="1133589">By the time they got back, the narcotic trafficker would disappear, the contraband would be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.459" offset="1157204">But, it is only in those emergent circumstances that this legislation was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.066" offset="1179669">Those circumstances are not present in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.983" offset="1191267">We have a very, very unusual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.534" offset="1205478">At the time of the argument, the government did not submit one affidavit from any of the arresting officers to justify their entrance into this man's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.581" offset="1249677">United States Attorney, the assistant did submit an affidavit, which he candidly admit it was based upon information and belief in which he says "we saw the man seated in his house in his living room at 8:50 in the evening and we went inside and we arrested him under this whole invalid warrant and then we conducted a search."</text>
            <text syncTime="306.939" offset="1331179">As noted by Judge Waterman in his dissenting opinion, there is no case in this Court upholding the search of a home by officers having neither an arrest warrant nor a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.695" offset="1382170">And, in the Roy Jones case, 357 United States, the government, for the first time, contended that agents had authority under federal law to enter a house, make an arrest based upon probable cause, and then to seize contraband that was visible.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.333" offset="1456671">However, this Court said these contentions would confront us with a grave constitutional question, namely, whether forceful nighttime entry into a dwelling to arrest a person reasonably believed to be within there, upon probable cause, that he had committed a felony under circumstances where no reason appears why arrest -- an arrest warrant could not have been obtained is consistent with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.289" offset="1576521">However, this issue was not determined because, from the testimony, it was clearly apparent that the arrest was but a mere pretext to make the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.783" offset="1622497">And so, in our case, it is our contention, too, that this whole invalid warrant that was used was but a mere pretext to make the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.314" offset="1660635">The government concedes, in its brief, that the petitioner was under close surveillance immediately proceeding, during, and after the narcotics transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.530" offset="1701491">It further admits in its brief that, no doubt, the agents did controvert a search of the premises for narcotics as an incident to petitioner's arrest if he were arrested in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.643" offset="1745899">This man was under surveillance for a period of six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.105" offset="1759796">The agents undoubtedly could've arrested him at any time outside of his dwelling, but they knew that if they arrested him on the sidewalk in front of his house, they could not go into his apartment and make a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.279" offset="1812459">They knew they could not obtain a search warrant because, during the entire five months period that they have the invalid warrant of arrest, no incriminating factors appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.152" offset="1860002">Now, a search warrant had already been denied by the United States Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.682" offset="1878079">So, therefore, they took the bull by the horns and they said, "Well, if we're going to make the search, we're going to use this warrant that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.470" offset="1913292">We're going to go into the apartment, arrest this man on that warrant, and then we're going to conduct the search."</text>
            <text syncTime="459.257" offset="1940355">And, we further contend that a warrant with arrest is no different than arrest under a warrant, both must be executed within a reasonable period of time and the six months waiting period is not a reasonable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.275" offset="2004511">Of course, the government has the right to wait for certain circumstance to develop in order to spring the trap, as we said in the Robinowitz case, but that doesn't give them the right to wait month after month after month when no incriminating factors appear.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="492.482" offset="2073266">Is that an issue up here?</text>
            <text syncTime="494.079" offset="2079640">I thought the Court of Appeals had held the arrest warrant invalid for defects in its issuance.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_lewis" startTime="501.790" stopTime="502.755">
            <label>Mr. Jerome Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="501.790" offset="2110568">Yes, sir.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="502.755" stopTime="514.568">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="502.755" offset="2114435">And held that the search -- they upheld to search on the ground that there was probable ca -- the arrest, rather, upon the ground that there was probable cause to make the arrest.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_lewis" startTime="514.568" stopTime="1027.693">
            <label>Mr. Jerome Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="514.568" offset="2161664">I submit to you, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that the arrest was unlawful because it was a stale arrest and, therefore, any search as an incident to an unlawful stale arrest is, in effect, unlawful and not permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.558" offset="2229582">And, that is what Judge Waterman stated in his opinion, that the government can't wait six months on a warrant with arrest and to go into a man's home and then make an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.361" offset="2280782">He said that was a stale arrest and an unlawful arrest and the fact that you can have reasonable grounds to believe that a crime was committed, you cannot wait indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.914" offset="2322996">And, my research and Judge Waterman's research also, we have found no case where more than a month elapsed that an arrest, under those circumstances, were held to be justifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.027" offset="2375450">In effect -- in fact, most of the cases hold that the government cannot hold back an arrest with the mere expectation and hope that, certainly, some criminal activities may come into the -- come into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.835" offset="2434696">They waited six months here and, without any other incriminating factors, they went into this man's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.726" offset="2462281">Now, our Constitution says that a warrant must be executed within a reasonable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.953" offset="2487150">We submit, a warrant with arrest is in the same category.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.533" offset="2501465">Congress, by giving the agents the right to make a warrantless arrest, certainly did not carve out by statute the necessity or a greater liberality than tho -- than we have under our Constitution and I say that, if under a warrant of arrest an execution must be within a reasonable time and six months is not, then a warrantless arrest falls into the same category and it, therefore, follows that since this arrest, assuming they had reasonable grounds, of course which we deny, then this arrest was stale and unlawful and any search as an incident to a stale arrest must of course, therefore, be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.890" offset="2674918">Now, it is our further contention that the agents did not have probable cause to arrest the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.485" offset="2709295">Back in October 1958, Agents Monaghan and Costa from the Federal Narcotics Bureau submitted two affidavits in support of their application for a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.987" offset="2751300">The search warrant was denied by the United States Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.991" offset="2767287">In Monaghan's affidavit, he said that he met one Panzarella in August of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.810" offset="2794663">They had some discussion about purchasing narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.436" offset="2809083">Panzarella said, "I'm going to call up my connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.701" offset="2818173">I'll let you know."</text>
            <text syncTime="679.746" offset="2822353">He made a phone call, came back to Monaghan, they went from Manhattan to the County of Queens, Monaghan saw Panzarella go into a green Chrysler car which was owned by the petitioner, Pan -- Di Bella.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.756" offset="2890376">Panzarella, then, emerged from the car and gave an envelope containing heroin to the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.488" offset="2917334">The same process was repeated in September of 1958 but this time, in addition, Panzarella is alleged to have said to the agent "Di Bella is my source of supply."</text>
            <text syncTime="716.659" offset="2969997">Now, Agent Costa says that he had Di Bella under observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.591" offset="2993716">He saw Panzarella enter the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.268" offset="3004479">He didn't see anything pass between the two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.553" offset="3017540">He saw them in the car and, later, he saw Panzarella leave the car and joined Agent Monaghan.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.643" offset="3041991">He was familiar with this alleged conversation because Monaghan told him that Panzarella had said that Di Bella was his source of supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.564" offset="3085667">Now, the lower court held that probable cause existed and cited the Jones case, the Cecil Jones case in 362 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.639" offset="3125896">Now, Judge Waterman, in his dissenting opinion, believed that the facts in this case were even weaker than in the Henry case.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.037" offset="3155571">Well, he stated that, in the Jones case, the officer, a detective by the name of Didone stated that he had received information from this informer, that this man was a reliable informant, and that he had received reliable information from him prior thereto, that the defendants or the suspects were narcotic addicts and that the detective had received reliable information from other reliable resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.797" offset="3278555">But, in our case, Panzarella was not a reliable informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.618" offset="3297886">He had never given information to the federal agents before.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.391" offset="3316903">There is no evidence that Di Bella was a narcotics user and there was no further evidence and information given by any other reliable source that Di Bella was involved in narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.460" offset="3365177">Now, if I remember correctly, in the Cecil Jones case, it was said that of all the detective could go by was the fact that he had been told that the informant had purchased narcotics from the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.042" offset="3423587">That would not be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.693" offset="3430170">There must be corroborating factors to sustain the information given by the informant, and Judge Waterman argued in his opinion that the fact that two men are seen in an automobile and nothing is passed between the two of them is not the same type of corroboration that this Court held was valid in the Cecil Jones case.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.768" offset="3518464">And so, I submit to Your Honor, assuming arguendo now that there was reasonable for grounds for this agent to enter a man's home six months after an alleged crime had been committed, in the absence of any special necessitous circumstances, just merely seeing a man seated in his living room not knowing that he had contraband there, not knowing that he was going to flee, where they could've arrested him at any time they wanted but, of course, knowing that if they arrested him outside of his home, they couldn't go into his home and obtain a warrant, where the facts are just like in this Roy Jones case and in the Lefkowitz case that they were using it merely as a pretext.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.060" offset="3699649">They didn't want to arrest this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.630" offset="3705919">They could've done it at any time they wanted to, but they weren't until they get into his apartment and then to arrest him and make a search as an incident thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.049" offset="3743535">If that is permitted, I will say -- I say most deferentially to Your Honors that a narcotics agent will never have to obtain a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.927" offset="3787107">He'll never have to obtain a warrant of arrest because an arrest under probable cause, under the Narcotics Control Act, then would be equivalent to a general search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.200" offset="3836217">He could bypass the Magistrate with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.262" offset="3848443">He becomes a law unto himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.931" offset="3859101">He can enter a man's home any time that he wants, no matter when alleged crime was committed in the night, 2:00 in the morning, rouse him out of bed and make an arrest then conduct the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.474" offset="3909256">Certainly, our lawmakers never contemplated that when they enacted the Narcotics Control Act which was strictly confined to those emergent circumstances where if the agents didn't act with dispatch and under the exigencies that existed, why, the narcotic trafficker would flee or the contraband would be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.001" offset="3987414">And, we haven't -- we do not have that in this particular case and I say, to permit such unparalleled power to be given to narcotics agents would be a dangerous precedent and an emasculation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.012" offset="4047391">Now, Your Honors, I have not said one word about the appeal of penalty question.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.603" offset="4065782">I believe it's not properly before this Court because the government is asking affirmative relief that the case be remanded to the Court of Appeals with directions that that portion of it be reversed consenting the appealability of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.328" offset="4124714">I say that, since the government wants affirmative relief, they should have cross-petitioned for that relief, and I'm not arguing at this time but, if Your Honors believe that that point should be argued, I have reserved approximately 10 minutes of my time to counter any arguments by the prosecutor -- by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.882" offset="4202872">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.531" offset="4405478">I'm going to deal with, first, his threshold contention that we cannot raise the issue of appealability, then appealability, and then the substantive issues of the search and seizure insofar as I have the time to deal with several contentions which the petitioner has made in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.717" offset="4490219">Petitioner's threshold contention is that the government can't issue -- can't argue in this Court that the order of the District Court was appealable -- was not appealable because the government did not petition for writ of certiorari and his reasoning is that the government is, in effect, seeking to overturn a portion of the judgment below, that portion which held that the order of the District Court was appealable to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.004" offset="4595440">And, we think that petitioner's contention in this regard is clearly wrong under the decisions of this Court, that a party could always argue the lack of jurisdiction of the court in which the case is or of any court below, and this Court has repeatedly held that this Court and other federal courts can, and in fact they must, raise questions of jurisdiction on their own motion even when neither party raises the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.687" offset="4710170">Now, none of these cases have been cited by the government in its brief because we didn't think that petitioner would even contest our right to raise the issue of appealability in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.661" offset="4754056">Perhaps, the leading case in this -- on this issue is Railway Company versus Swan and that's in 111 United States 379.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.795" offset="4794598">There, the court states that "the rule springing for the nature and limited the judicial power of the United States is inflexible and without exception which requires this Court of its own motion to deny its own jurisdiction and, in the exercise of its appellate power that of all other courts of the United States on every writ of error or appeal, the first and fundamental question --</text>

            <text syncTime="1202.039" offset="4911522">I'm quoting from Railway Company versus Swan, Your Honor, at 111 United States 379.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.511" offset="4945377">On every writ of error or appeal, the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction, first, of this Court and then of the court from which the record comes and it -- and this Court has held that the question of appealability to the Court of Appeals was jurisdictional in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.445" offset="5021132">There -- that, in the sense that this Court must consider on its own motion whether the case was appealable to the Court of Appeals in a series of cases, in Stratton versus the Railway Company in 282 United States, in Shanferoke Corporation versus Westchester Corporation in 293 U.S., in the Storer Broadcasting Company case only recently in 351 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.467" offset="5129279">And, therefore, I'm now going to turn to the substantive issue whether the District Court's order was in fact appealable and the government submits that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.107" offset="5179852">The petitioner moved to suppress in any criminal proceeding the evidence which was seized at the time of his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.019" offset="5215483">We emphasize that he did not move, even incidentally, for the return of any property which was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.293" offset="5248502">The motion was filed by the petitioner after the complaint have been made against him, after he was arraigned, waived preliminary examination, released on bail, and bound over for action by the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.826" offset="5306702">The motion was filed before indictment but the District Court's order denying the motion was decided after the indictment had been returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.791" offset="5346513">We believe that, in these circumstances, that the order of the District Court was part of the criminal case and that it was, therefore, interlocutory, that it was not a final determination of an independent proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.885" offset="5402937">And, therefore, the government submits that the order was not appealable under 28 U.S.C. 1291 which gives the Court of Appeals jurisdiction only over final decisions of the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.084" offset="5459675">Now, it might appear that it was in the interest of the prosecution generally, that the government take a broad view of appealability for an appeal before trial is the only way that the government can obtain review of orders deciding motions to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.072" offset="5527698">If an order granting a pretrial motion to suppress is not appealable and the trial court does not overturn this order, the government will never have an opportunity to obtain appellate review since, of course, if the defendant is acquitted the government cannot appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.690" offset="5606170">On the other hand, if the motion to suppress is denied, if the trial court admits the evidence, the defendant of course could obtain appellate review of this order claiming that the evidence which was admitted against him and which led, in part, to his conviction was illegally obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.184" offset="5676074">Nevertheless, it is the government's position that it is in the interest of criminal justice that appeal be allowed only from orders which, in a realistic and practical sense, are independent of the main criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.593" offset="5733752">We do not think that interlocutory appeals, either by the government or by defendants, should be encouraged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.750" offset="5766353">A broad rule, we think, of apealability would mean a considerable delay in the already too lengthy time, perhaps, needed to try criminal cases and such delay would seriously interfere with the proper administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.957" offset="5835212">We think it is clearly of great importance that when an alleged criminal has been arrested that the trial be conducted as soon as possible after the events on which the allegations are based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.731" offset="5890278">This Court has held that the appeal of the tentative or incomplete decisions, particularly in criminal cases, is incompatible with the fair and orderly administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.361" offset="5940851">In the Cobbledick case in 309 United States, the Court said that "Congress, from the very beginning has, by forbidding piecemeal disposition on appeal of what, for practical purposes, is a single controversy, set itself against enfeebling judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.677" offset="6022040">Encouragement of delay is fatal to the devin -- to the vindication of the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.746" offset="6046386">The correctness of a trial court's rejection, even of a constitutional claim made by the accused in the process of prosecution, must await his conviction before its reconsideration by an appellate tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.310" offset="6100616">We submit that this standard should be applied in determining whether an order deciding a motion to suppress or any other order, for that matter, is -- as the Cobbledick case states, is appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.925" offset="6151084">It's as the Cobbledick case states, whether the order is, for practical purposes, part of the criminal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.300" offset="6584613">Cogen says, and we admit, that the dictum in Cogen is contrary to the government's position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.208" offset="6608227">However, it is not the issue that was before the Court in Cogen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.259" offset="6620453">There, the motion was after indictment and, of course, both of them -- both petitioner and the government agree that if this motion had been made after indictment that it would not have been -- that the order deciding it would not have been appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.223" offset="6672280">Now, as to Bur -- the Burdeau case, there was no discussion there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.284" offset="6692551">We admit that that is contrary to the government's position if one ignores the difference between motions for return and motions for suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.957" offset="6739153">The property which was involved in that case were papers and other documents which, at least on the face of it, were of value to the defendant and, therefore, we would agree under the standard we're suggesting in this case to the Court that that motion -- that that order deciding the motion was appealable prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.780" offset="6834448">Now, as to Perlman, there, too, the documents -- there were documents involved but it w -- but that decision is, to some extent inconsistent with the view we are taking since it is admitted -- it was admitted in Perlman that movement was not entitled to the return of the d -- of the papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.585" offset="6933713">He had given the papers to the court to be impounded -- in a civil proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.190" offset="6956178">Therefore, his motion was, in essence, a motion which said that the papers couldn't go out of the hands of the court in the civil proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.378" offset="6984913">They couldn't be used by the government but we think, essentially, what was decided there was that it -- when there's a motion -- when there -- when the papers involved return from the government, the government has no right to the papers, but a motion prior to indictment is appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.429" offset="7053040">Now, we also admit that none of these cases really draw the distinction which we are drawing between motions to return as to papers or other valuable property in motions asking only suppression.</text>
