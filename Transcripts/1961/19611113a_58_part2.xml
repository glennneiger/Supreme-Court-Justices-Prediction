            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="117.546" offset="573524">Before recess, I was just pointing out that -- well, this admittedly comes before the Court in a fairly unsatisfactory fashion because of the change of counsel and then change of empathy and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.332" offset="632665">It seemed to us that when petition's allegations are read against the record, it is quite clear that he is claiming that the jury should have believed him and that his allegations depend on his own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.238" offset="692328">And I just want to summarize briefly so that the Court will know what we base this on.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.853" offset="726810">The Government evidence was that the Chicago Police, having received both information implicating petitioner and a confession by a codefendant implicating petitioner got a warrant and send it to Florida where they thought petitioner was, they then learned he'd gone to Chicago and so they called the Chicago Police and asked them to make the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.207" offset="836211">The Chicago -- the Government brought one Chicago policeman to testify at the trial that was the man who was in charge of making the arrest and who participated in the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.852" offset="890755">His testimony was that he was admitted peaceably and that he told petitioner he was wanted in Washington and that he asked whether petitioner had any guns and petitioner showed them to him and he seized the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.241" offset="972361">There was no -- it was completely a peaceful arrest on Sunday, April 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.011" offset="999424">Now, petitioner was held from April 29 until May 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.037" offset="1023561">He wasn't brought before magistrate on April 30th because the Chicago Police hadn't got a warrant, but at the time he was arrested, the petitioner said he would go back to Washington and on May 1st in formal proceedings before a Chicago Police Court Judge, he waived extradition and agreed to return to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.863" offset="1114781">The Washington Police got to Chicago on May 2nd, they asked the petitioner about the crime and he denied being implicated until he was shown the confessions of the two, his brother and another codependent at which point he made a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.130" offset="1207881">The Chicago policeman testified that when he made the arrest, he talked to the petitioner about the warrant, but at the time of the arrest, petitioner made no admission and he said so far as he knew petitioner was not further questioned although he was off the next day because -- and he did say they had other things to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.644" offset="1301922">When petitioner was brought back to Washington, he repeated his confession before the victim of the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.747" offset="1338389">Now, petitioner at the trial testified that the Chicago police had their guns drawn when they arrested him.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.714" offset="1362213">He said that various officers, not the one who testified at the trial, had him in three or four lineups where there was no questioning and that he was questioned three or four times, never for more than 30 or 40 minutes while he was held before he was -- before he waived extradition on May 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.265" offset="1468479">A cross-examination outside the presence of the jury not repeated before the jury, he testified that the Chicago police roughed him up a little bit, but admittedly he made no confessions or admissions to Chicago Police and admittedly, the Chicago police were very nice to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.408" offset="1540995">Now, the only real threat that -- to which he testified was the Chicago police did that he would be turned over to the Chicago Police -- the Washington Police said he should know -- the Chicago Police if he didn't confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.487" offset="1601285">The Washington Police denied any threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.019" offset="1611421">Now, there's a certain inherent incredibility in the alleged threats since admittedly from the time the Chicago Police picked him up, they told him he was in Washington and admittedly on May 1st, he's waived extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.268" offset="1676413">On this basis, it seems to us that the claim of coercion was at best, a question for the jury which as I have said was submitted to the jury under instructions that were not accepted to, that were specifically accepted by trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.875" offset="1750915">And for that reason, we think petitioner cannot allege, it's not merely a form of words, we think he cannot allege that on the undisputed evidence, there was coercion as a matter of law and therefore, we think he cannot even allege the denial of a constitutional right and that the Court of Appeals insofar as to discuss that question, discussed the hypothetical question.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.127" offset="1891871">First of all, I think there are certain things that we ought to get straight as to what is not in dispute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.558" offset="1921651">It is not in dispute that the petitioner did, in his petition under Section 2255, claim that his confession was admitted in evidence at his trial and used against him over the objection of trial counsel and that the rights of the defendant under the Constitution and laws of the United States were clearly violated by the above described procedure that being part of the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.098" offset="2031783">He did raise certain McNabb and Mallory questions, but he -- the point is that he did specifically allege that this confession was -- should not have been admitted as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.287" offset="2084551">The District Court on its hearing and whatever basis it arrived in its decision, we do not know because there is no transcript of that -- of that proceeding, held that the confession was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.542" offset="2149543">We don't know the basis for this decision in that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.405" offset="2161037">The Court of Appeals did not review this decision, and this is the decision that we say that the petitioner is entitled to a judicial determination of, was if an error as a matter of law to have submitted this confession to the jury.</text>
