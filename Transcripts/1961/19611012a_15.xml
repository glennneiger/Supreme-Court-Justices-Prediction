            <text syncTime="37.413" offset="253053">This appeal is from the affirmance by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of a decree declaring the escheat to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of the amounts of Western Union telegraphic money orders which originated at office in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.425" offset="329122">The Western Union Telegraph Company, the appellant, asserts that the Pennsylvania escheat law as here applied is repugnant to the Fourteenth Amend -- the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it escheats these amounts with which the Pennsylvania has no sufficient contacts without sufficient notice and without giving Western Union the protection to which it is entitled or should be entitled under the Constitution against liability to others for the same amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.034" offset="487528">Western Union is a New York corporation with its principal office in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.322" offset="508635">It has thousands of offices in the 48 states and District of Columbia where it is registered to do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.576" offset="541654">It's not registered in Alaska or Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.260" offset="560462">Its interstate business is regulated by the interstate -- by the Federal Communications Commission, formerly by the Intestate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.227" offset="596302">It has been continuously regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.389" offset="612916">A telegraphic money order transaction is designed to cause a credit for payment of money to be telegraphed from the office of origin to a payee at another office.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.493" offset="669341">The sender -- sender of the money order goes into Western Union office and fills out an application form and pays the principal amount plus the tolls and gets a receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.488" offset="709360">A message is then sent from the office of origin to the Western Union office closest to the designated payee who is often called the sendee.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.401" offset="760978">This message directs the second office, the office of destination to make payments to the designated sendee by negotiable draft the file tariffs of the -- this telegraph company call for this form of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.410" offset="853034">The office of destination gets to in touch with the sendee.He is called in and given a negotiable draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.922" offset="895039">If he wants cash immediately, he can endorse that draft and in fact in return for currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.028" offset="927535">But very often, because this draft is in some ways preferable to cash, he walks out of the office with the draft.</text>

            <text syncTime="2604.035" offset="10519489">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.940" offset="10539133">New York has filed here as amicus curiae in the Court being given permission to argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.683" offset="10570062">As amicus curiae asking that the Court not decide this appeal on consideration only of Pennsylvania's contention that it has jurisdiction of these obligations by virtue of the amenability to process of Western Union, 48 states, at least, United States can make that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.041" offset="10683538">Nor on consideration only of the single contact that Pennsylvania has with these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.253" offset="10720423">Now, whether we say situs in the traditional way or contact as that term has been used in the fairly recent escheat case in decisions, opinions by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.040" offset="10795551">Now, I should say that in all escheat cases, the holder has no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.978" offset="10839333">It is the key, is or it is the holder, banks, life insurance and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.443" offset="10873187">The interest is by the owner who is unknown or cannot be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.129" offset="10911848">Now, we ask the Court that if you -- the whole of this transactions, the kind of transactions these are, with virtually every one of them passing through several states and to evaluate Pennsylvania's claim in that plight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.656" offset="11005994">Now, we ask the Court to evaluate the claim of the State of New York which in this case is the state of incorporation and the state where the principal office of the obligor is located and where the obligation is -- ultimately has its place as Mr. Buchanan has described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.477" offset="11129292">Now, obviously, in these multistate transactions, Western Union having its offices and thousands of offices in the 48 states, in other words, not just one office but thousands of them, it would be difficult of course, to bring all of the states that could possibly have a claim before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.933" offset="11231065">We submit that Pennsylvania in this case is representative of all the other states which have some contact with these transactions as contrasted with New York State in this case because the step that may take place in anyone of these several states is no more essential in the transactions than the step which may take place in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.588" offset="11361677">And accordingly, the contact again of anyone said state would not be greater than a contact of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.365" offset="11400861">This would include Pennsylvania and perhaps Pennsylvania's claim is a great and its contact is a great deal less than that of, for example, the state where the sendee has been or where he is resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.304" offset="11472541">And so we asked the Court to weigh as alternative to the number of states with minor and equal in value and degree, at the most, the ultimate and essential contacts of the principal office of Western Union with the transactions and therefore, of the state of the principal office of Western Union, New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.056" offset="11611617">Now, Pennsylvania, in its brief, has sent that New York's position in this case is and in its statutes is different from the position we took in the Connecticut Mutual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.138" offset="11699911">And perhaps in my comment on that, I will also answer Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question of where Connecticut Mutual and Standard Oil leaves us or states which are before the Court on the question of escheat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.177" offset="11792071">I think our position is in harmony with the position we took in Western -- in Connecticut Mutual and also that where those cases leave us is that the factors in one kind of transaction point to one state as having the jurisdiction, the dominant contacts and in another transaction, another kind of transaction that another state has it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3608.468" offset="14537226">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.457" offset="14549243">Perhaps I will first endeavored to answer Mrs. Toch because she spoke last and that is always most clearly in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.876" offset="14606921">I have no objection to the fact but the fact is that in filing its petition before this Court, the State of New York seemed to rest its application on the question of the domicile of the corporation, the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.388" offset="14676929">However, the brief filed by the State of New York seems to depart from that position and argues rather on contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.870" offset="14710888">Now, it seems to me that in the contents of the brief, New York leans over toward the position taken by Pennsylvania and depends on contacts rather than the mere fact of domicile of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.129" offset="14791868">Now, this of course must necessarily be so because in the sense, it was New York in the decision of its appellate court by its legislature on the decision in Connecticut Life versus Moore in 297 New York, that got away from the question of the domicile of better corporation and rest it in a contacts, the so-called superior contacts that New York had with the insurance policy stoned by foreign insurance companies, domesticated in New York and so to residents of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.151" offset="14944005">It's true that when that case reached this Court, this Court modified the cases of escheat or to taking under its custodial law various classes of policies that might have troubled this Court such as the residence of the beneficiary and other factors that were then involved but it was New York itself that in that series of cases departed from the principle that is a insignificant fact that a corporation has its domicile in one place or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.360" offset="15088828">Now, this business we've heard about the unseemly raise of the states for the escheat of funds, just isn't held up by the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.705" offset="15138147">It so happens when my hair was a lot darker even then day, I argued the original client case in this Court way back in the 303 U.S. 20 some years have passed from that day and I leave it to this Court to answer for itself how many us chief cases have reached this Court in those 20 some years.</text>

            <text syncTime="4192.316" offset="16872678">These drafts, we must remember, are issued -- we're issued no less than 15 years to go in any instance and in some instances 30 years ago, as assumed by Exhibit A in the record page 59, where there's a representative list, of this type of graft.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.402" offset="16969017">Only one item is for a hundred dollars and the rest are for $1 to $15 dollar maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.539" offset="16997543">We understand that that is represented those 20 items are represented above the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.180" offset="17024084">Now, you've have heard they might not be a majority of cases but many of these drafts were issued intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.792" offset="17058565">The sender was in Pennsylvania, the recipient was in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.533" offset="17081553">The whereabouts of neither is known, no claims has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.077" offset="17111646">Now what about these drafts, isn't it interesting that the respondent himself in his answer in the State Court in Pennsylvania, pleaded that the Pennsylvania stature of limitations has deprived to all of these drafts and there was no further liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.259" offset="17188446">Now, in this situation we are much of the fears of dual liability, triple liability, quintuple liability but in fact, this respondent while it didn't pass in the appellate court, did plead at the Pennsylvania statute of limitations was a bar to all of the drafts, and I think any liability to run wherever held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.296" offset="17276531">Now, going to the question or fear of liability over and over again, that certainly wouldn't be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.586" offset="17309759">That the respondent has any fear on that score at all because himself, has categorically pleaded that these obligations are all dated.</text>
