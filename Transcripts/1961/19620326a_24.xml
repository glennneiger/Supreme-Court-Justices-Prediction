            <text syncTime="35.043" offset="243545">This case presents an important point of constitutional law upon a brief statement of facts which had been stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.256" offset="280430">This is a suit for refund of tax monies paid under protest to the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.540" offset="301537">The case arises in the field of state taxation of interstate commerce and the governing principle of law under the Constitution of the United States is that the Constitution of the United States, the Interstate Commerce Clause forbids tax discrimination by the states for the forthright or ingenious.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.779" offset="382516">That the Equal Protection of the law’s Clause, that the Due Process Clause forbids arbitrary tax discrimination by the states even where there is no element of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.469" offset="433298">The classification for tax purposes may not be probably arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.279" offset="460466">Now, the Louisiana Collector of Revenue, as we see it, takes the position that Louisiana may levy an excise tax upon the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.535" offset="505501">The Louisiana Supreme Court has upheld the Collector of Revenue and as we view that decision has held that Louisiana may discriminate against the multistate or interstate business that Louisiana may thus give a direct commercial advantage to local business.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.320" offset="580629">Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company of Duncan, Oklahoma, appellant taxpayer, has appealed from this decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court on the ground that it is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States and particularly to the Interstate Commerce Clause, the Equal Protection of the laws Clause and the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.049" offset="659519">This Court has noted probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.438" offset="673102">The tax in question is the Louisiana use tax which as a part of the Louisiana sales and use tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.323" offset="700688">The tax rate is 2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.480" offset="709256">In the case of the sales tax, the intrastate tax, the rate is 2% of the sales tax -- of the sales price to the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.181" offset="744051">In the case of the use tax, the rate is 2% of the cost price to the purchaser who imports the goods, that is the purchaser who has purchased the goods outside of the State of Louisiana and brought them into the state for his own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.335" offset="804760">Halliburton's complaint is not of the 2% tax rate which is the same in both taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.045" offset="827538">Halliburton's complaint is of discrimination in the choice of tax basis to which the 2% rate is applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.629" offset="5901876">He says that for Halliburton, “this is not an interstate commerce problem, but a problem of management in locating its operations so as to reduce its cost of operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.478" offset="6061328">Simultaneously, he argues it by a good corporate management, Halliburton could have avoided this Louisiana tax by ceasing its interstate operations and becoming an entirely domestic or intrastate operator, having its entire operation with Louisiana -- within Louisiana’s borders.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.230" offset="6312312">Stipulations which appear found on page 34 sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.064" offset="6327672">With reference to the second factual situation relating to isolated sales, an isolated sale or a casual sale as defined by Louisiana law is a sale by a person not regularly engaged in selling the type of goods in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.106" offset="6395800">Isolated sales are expressly exempted from the Louisiana intrastate sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.139" offset="6423907">For example, if I should have sold in Louisiana, in Baton Rouge, before I left to let a counsel for the Collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.598" offset="6461733">I’ll offer for my necktie, assuming that I’m not regularly engaged in the business of merchandising such acts, there would have been no Louisiana sales tax on that casual isolated transaction because such transactions from persons not regularly engaged in selling for tax free by specific exemption from the sales tax and that also is stipulated on page 34 of our brief in this language because this is applied to Halliburton situation but it covers this precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.208" offset="6600182">The entire purchase price would not have been subject to the Louisiana sales tax or the Louisiana use tax had the purchase of such equipment been made within the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.857" offset="6638843">Now of course when I bought this tie in Baton Rouge, it had a 2% sales tax upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.099" offset="6663816">If I should resell it to the Collector in Baton Rouge, there would have been no 2% use tax upon it that's stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.195" offset="6692133">But if I should sell them in this Courtroom, this larva or this necktie and if he should take them and put them in his briefcase, the book and the necktie around his neck and move them in the channels of interstate commerce back to Louisiana and they'll use it, if he should walk into the office of the Collector of Revenue wearing his necktie which he bought in the office -- in the Supreme Court room in Washington, the Collector would say, "Did you buy that outside the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.738" offset="6806340">If you did and if you moved it in the channels of interstate commerce, you owe me a 2% use tax."</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.111" offset="6827865">Now, of course it wouldn’t be sales tax if you had bought it in Louisiana, but whenever you add the element of interstate transportation to casually purchased or isolated -- isolated sales, we want to a use tax because there is no comparable -- or isolated transaction in the use tax, the interstate part of Louisiana sales and use tax statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.570" offset="7029635">But as we see it, the two exactly the same, in the case of the labor and overhead, a manufacturer outside the state step one, a transport of the channels of interstate commerce and leave the state and use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.020" offset="7083447">In the case of the isolated sales, they buy it outside the state, they move it in the channels of interstate commerce and they use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.510" offset="7113435">Now, if you eliminate that multi-state activity in each one, it is stipulated that there is no tax and that stipulation which we forecast that the Collector will ignore is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.230" offset="7168293">In reference to labor and overhead, Halliburton operated in a location within the State of Louisiana, there would have been no Louisiana sales tax or use tax due upon the labor and shop overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.460" offset="7213223">With reference to isolated sales, again at page 34 stipulated, the purchase price would not have been subject to Louisiana sales tax or the Louisiana use tax at the sale -- at the purchase of such equipment been made within the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.398" offset="7292949">Henneford simply -- in the Henneford case, the Silas Mason Company had brought into the State of Washington heavy moving equipment to construct the Grand Coulee Dam and they said, "Look, you can’t put this use tax on us by definition, it implies only to goods that have been brought across the state line in interstate commerce."</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.147" offset="7367973">Not so, said Mr. Justice Cardozo through this item of the use tax only falls upon goods which have been moved in interstate commerce but the tax is exactly equal to and does not discriminate and therefore it does not offend the Interstate Commerce Clause.</text>
