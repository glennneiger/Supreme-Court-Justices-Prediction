            <label>Mr. E. J. Skeen</label>
            <text syncTime="13.132" offset="155878">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.791" offset="174582">This is an appeal from a judgment of the three-judge court, denying injunctive relief against the enforcement of the Utah Safety Responsibility statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.810" offset="230588">We contend that the Utah statute conflicts with Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act and is therefore void.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.579" offset="277713">With the permission of the Court, I would like to read a brief reference from the section -- sections of the statute that we have in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.189" offset="324106">They are found on pages 3 and 4 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.127" offset="343855">“Whenever any person fails, within 60 days, to satisfy any judgment upon the written request of the judgment creditor or his attorney, it shall be the duty of the clerk of the court or the judge of a court which has no clerk in which such a judgment is rendered within the State to forward to the Commission immediately after expiration of said 60 days, a certified copy of the judgment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="86.269" offset="448449">The following section provides that upon the receipt of the certified copy of the judgment, the Commission shall suspend the license and the registration of the judgment debtor’s vehicle and then follows a subsection, “if the judgment creditor consents in writing in such form as the Commission may prescribe that the judgment debtor be allowed license and registration or non-operating residence operating privilege, the same maybe allowed by the Commission in its discretion for six months, from the date of such consent and thereafter until the consent is revoked.”</text>
            <text syncTime="134.062" offset="639666">The following section provides that such license and registration shall remain so suspended and shall not be renewed or shall any such license registration be thereafter issued in the name of the person unless and until such judgment is stayed, satisfied in full or to the extent hereinafter provided and until the said person gives proof of financial responsibility, then follows this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.508" offset="777383">“The discharge in bankruptcy following the rendering of any such judgment shall not relieve the judgment debtor from any of the requirements of the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="179.615" offset="821791">The following section provides for application for -- to the Court for relief, but it’s not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.675" offset="870066">Now, we take the position, Your Honors, that the provisions of the statute I have read give the creditor a measure of control of the suspension and renewal of the driver's license which in effect puts into operation a collection device and what in effect, write into the Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act another exception, which we contend would be clearly contrary to the constitutional provision granting to the Congress the right to establish the power and authority to establish a uniform bankruptcy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.188" offset="1084165">Section 17, Your Honors will recall, provides a discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all his provable debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.606" offset="1125752">The facts in this case are such as to squarely raise this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.773" offset="1154487">The bankrupt, appellant here, was sued in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.367" offset="1184789">A judgment was recovered against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.917" offset="1199000">The judgment creditor immediately requested that the copy of the judgment be sent to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.461" offset="1241213">The Commission suspended his driver's license and registration certificate and the -- following that, the bankrupt or the judgment debtor, filed a petition in bankruptcy and he was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.259" offset="1328358">Following his discharge, the bankrupt made a written application to the Commission to restore his driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.412" offset="1372975">That application was denied and the letter denying it, which is in the record, the Commission stated that -- quoted this provision that a discharge in bankruptcy shall not relieve the judgment debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.057" offset="1435564">The bankrupt then filed this proceeding in the bankruptcy court to assure to him the fruits of the litigation and to get injunctive relief through the bankruptcy court against the enforcement of the statute contending as I stated that the statute is void because it conflicts with the bankruptcy law.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.182" offset="1596061">We submitted the case on a stipulated set of facts which outlined what the judgment debtor had done and it's clear in this case that there was a request by the judgment creditor under the statute and we think it's very clear that the -- before starting the proceeding, the bankrupt made a timely application to have his license restored.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.551" offset="1785605">Now, did he -- did the Court find whether he'd complied with that section of the law or not?</text>

            <label>Mr. E. J. Skeen</label>
            <text syncTime="426.356" offset="1808802">The Court made no formal findings in the case we submitted it on the stipulated set of facts to the three-judge court and the -- it's certainly clear that there is no question about that based on the case before the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.763" offset="1902425">Now, this case Your Honor -- Honors --</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="455.305" offset="1924577">Does that bar this Court from considering whether there isn't relief for him under the state law which he has not exhausted?</text>
            <text syncTime="466.991" offset="1971388">The fact that the three-judge court, that the litigation didn't take that element into account to which the Chief Justice has referred, does that bar this Court from considering whether in fact we have what might be called an abstract question here?</text>
            <text syncTime="485.662" offset="2045994">In other words, the implication as I get it of the Chief Justice's question is that if he could get his license restored under state law by an appropriate application from the state agency and he didn't resort to that, then haven't we got a situation in which the constitutional question is what might be called premature?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="513.934" stopTime="559.672">
            <label>Mr. E. J. Skeen</label>
            <text syncTime="513.934" offset="2159156">Well, I might answer it in this way, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.424" offset="2181099">The bankrupt judgment debtor made a written request for restoration, setting up his discharge in bankruptcy and the relief was denied by the State not because he didn't tender performance under the -- by showing that he had insurance, but simply because the discharge in bankruptcy didn't entitle him to get the first base on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.494" offset="2309308">That -- that factually stopped any further proceedings to get the license renewed.</text>

          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="559.672" stopTime="577.366">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="559.672" offset="2342013">Well, you're -- neither your state agency, your Supreme Court held that the debt was not discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.565" offset="2373674">In other words, if he was sued for this judgment, debt, for discharging bankruptcy I'd take it would be controlling, wouldn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. E. J. Skeen</label>
            <text syncTime="584.855" offset="2442742">There's no question about that.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="586.130" offset="2447862">So that the -- what your state agency did as approved by your Supreme Court is not to say that the debt isn't discharged, didn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.368" offset="2488822">They said that in effect, what was said in Reitz namely that the State has another interest which isn't included in what -- in -- which isn't a consequence of a discharged debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.603" offset="2549739">The debt may be discharged and get some -- something -- some -- the State may draw some conclusion from the fact that the fellow didn't pay his debt although he doesn't have to pay it because of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>

          <turn speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="623.256" stopTime="637.593">
            <label>Mr. E. J. Skeen</label>
            <text syncTime="623.256" offset="2596446">Well, of course admittedly, the cases hold that the Bankruptcy Act simply destroys the procedure to collect the debt.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="637.593" stopTime="638.065">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="637.593" offset="2653706">Right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="638.065" stopTime="844.985">
            <label>Mr. E. J. Skeen</label>
            <text syncTime="638.065" offset="2655587">The debt is still there.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.879" offset="2662902">However, the position we take and urge is that the State has no right by this sort of legislation to inject another exception into Section 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.935" offset="2743150">And we contend that that's exactly what is happening here because of the element of creditor control in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.151" offset="2784005">Now, in the Reitz case, the Court concluded that had the clerk by a force of law been required to certify the judgment in and had the creditor had nothing to do with the case that it would be -- would not contravene the Bankruptcy Act and would be a valid exercise of the police power and constitutional, but in that case, we had the same problem involved here except that in this case, we think that there can be no severability of the creditor controlled features of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.432" offset="2989119">Your Honors will recall that in the Reitz case which involved the New York statute, the statute as originally enacted simply provided for the certification of the judgment to the Commission and the Commission was thereupon authorized to suspend the operation of the law for a period of three years -- or the license for a period of three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.825" offset="3094653">Then in 1936, New York amended the statute to permit the creditor, judgment creditor, to allow six months use of the suspended license and then in 1939, the New York statute was amended to provide for suspension only upon action of the judgment creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.231" offset="3208338">Now, those two amendments, 1939 and 1936 are substantially the same as our statute laws when it was enacted as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.336" offset="3248671">We did not go at it piecemeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.370" offset="3260897">The entire statute was enacted as a whole and we think that clearly, there was no possibility of these creditor control provisions being severable from the rest of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.590" offset="3325680">If they were taken out of the statute, it wouldn't be what the legislature intended and there wouldn't be any sense to the rest of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.364" offset="3360789">So we take the position in this case that we have now submitted to this Court for decision the question that was not decided in the Reitz case because the Court took the position that the 1936 and 1939 Amendments were severable from the rest of the statute and that if there is a -- if they're unconstitutional, the original statute was constitutional and sustained it.</text>

            <text syncTime="878.477" offset="3617311">And there is another limitation, the judgment debtor may pay up to $10,000 as I remember arising out of one accident and be relieved if he -- for example, there happened to be a $30,000 or $40,000 judgment against him, he could pay up to a minimum and be relieved.</text>

            <text syncTime="901.995" offset="3711352">What do you say to, apart from the difference that Justice Whittaker just called attention, what do you say to the consideration given by Judge Hand in writing in Reitz against Mealey for the three District Court -- for the District Court, what do you say to the considerations of Judge Hand that this business of spelling out in the statute that the creditor should ask a clerk to forward the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.497" offset="3845308">It's all eyewash because that happens anyhow, that the clerk wouldn't know whether debt was paid, that he would be nudged even though the statute said nothing about it, he would be nudged by the creditor who has chief interest so far as that goes in telling the unsatisfied judgment debt forwarded to the agency and that the clerk couldn't possibly know whether the judgment debt has been discharged without -- without calling upon the judgment creditor for all this information so that spelling out in the statute, the creditor must ask the clerk, he's merely spelling out what in fact takes place in life.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.009" offset="5787460">I believe that Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question fell out in the basic reason for the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.225" offset="5820270">I would like to submit that there are two other bases however in addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.467" offset="5841272">First that the State, and we indicate in our brief at the outset, perhaps I should say by way of introduction first, we conceded that this Court -- or the three-judge court had jurisdiction in the matter and of course this Court as well and I should like also to mention two additional facts that were not touched upon by counsel for the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.498" offset="5933328">In this instance, this particular bankrupt, discharged, in addition to this particular judgment, a $502 small loan and a $290 attorney's fee, the attorney's fee resulting from the trial of his negligent action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.614" offset="6009814">So that as a matter of fact, this bankrupt was principally discharging this particular debt in the course of taking out that bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.277" offset="6052446">And I also wish to point out that in response to this question of separability and what the legislature's intent is, there is no discussion in either brief about the legislative intent in passing this Act largely because there isn't any such record of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.067" offset="6115662">There are no reports of committee action that are printed by the legislature of the State of Utah except where there are some public hearing and there was none in this instance when this Act was passed in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.484" offset="6169266">The Act, as a matter of fact, is a copy of the Uniform Vehicle Code which has been widely adopted in many of the States in our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.384" offset="6212942">I point out on page 5 in our brief, in the Footnote, at the bottom, the 21 States, including Utah, which have so passed this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.472" offset="6249305">It's also of interest to note that the Congress has passed this Act with these creditor control provisions in them for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.221" offset="6288280">And assuming the intent of Congress and knowledge on the part of Congress, that it is aware to the paramountness of the Bankruptcy Act when Congress passed this Act for the District of Columbia it left this creditor control in the Act, I presume, assuming that you can ascribe some intent to Congress knowing or believing that these provisions did not conflict with the Bankruptcy Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2194.590" offset="8881716">That is to say requiring all judgments to be docketed whether they had been paid or a private arrangement had been made to settle the matter or not that in fact these are safeguards and protection for the judgment debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.857" offset="8930826">And if he finds a recalcitrant creditor, he first can go see him privately and say, “Can't we resolve this matter?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.016" offset="8955486">And if he can do this, the judgment creditor fails to certify up a request the judgment setup, his license remains intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.522" offset="8989445">If he can't do this and the judgment is set up, he still has the right assuming that the creditor is doing what is contended here, go into Court and ask the Court to set whatever monthly payment he can afford to pay and thereby get a restitution of his license so that he can continue to drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.283" offset="9068544">These provisions are as a matter of fact designed to soften an otherwise harsh effect of the Act and that Justice Hand -- Judge Hand pointed out in the lower court's three-judge decision in the Reitz case, it is best calculated to do the clerk's work for him if you put the responsibility on the judgment creditor to see to it that the judgment is set up as Justice Frankfurter pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.168" offset="9164048">And the other basis if -- another analogy as pointed out by the court below in this case in which it argued in holding unanimously that this Act was constitutional that for example in a criminal statute, the complaining witness is the party, sometimes the aggrieved party, the injured party who has to initiate the beginning of the criminal action and supposing carrying it to the logical conclusion that it were to say a burglary and the complaining witness signed a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.848" offset="9306781">The burglar is tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.199" offset="9312214">He is convicted and perhaps placed on probation and one of the conditions of the probation is to make full restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.414" offset="9336978">I reckon it could be there said that the complaining witness survived yet benefited directly, personally as a result of that order of restitution and having initiated this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.871" offset="9386820">But the fact that the complaining witness is directly benefited does not change the nature of the statute and make it no longer a police statute or a proper exercise of the state police power, the fact that he has benefited or recompressed is incidental to the proper exercise by the State of its police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.465" offset="9481279">And surely, if this Court is willing to say that where such a statute required mandatory forwarding of these judgments to the Commission as being constitutional at a proper exercise of the state police power, surely then, where there are other safeguards designed to facilitate and ease the burden on the judgment debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.853" offset="9582738">This type of statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.970" offset="9599248">It seemed to the matter of fact to put the Court -- put the State in the natural consequence of things if these Acts were to be held to be -- by this Court to be unconstitutional would mean that the State would thereby have to impose the requirement of insurance on all drivers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.313" offset="13624613">Counsel in his brief makes a statement that I wanted to make one comment about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.697" offset="13654183">On page 13, he says, appellee respectfully submits that this Court should find that the state policy of preventing financially irresponsible drivers from using its highways outweighs whatever intrusion the Act may incidentally make into the field of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.633" offset="13737880">Now, that sounds alright, but I don't believe this is a kind of a case where the Court can weigh equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.092" offset="13767764">I think that the Court has to determine whether this statute we're attacking makes any intrusion or whatever in the field of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.812" offset="13814575">If it makes any intrusion, the statute is void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.061" offset="13831607">It's not a matter of weighing equities.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3434.793" offset="13842578">I don't think there's any room for balancing here.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3438.425" offset="13857102">Because it's absolute.</text>
