            <text syncTime="40.618" offset="265801">This is an appeal by certain water carriers authorized and certified under the Transportation Act of 1940 to move grain by barge from Northern Illinois to Chicago where the waterway ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.149" offset="380008">From an order of a statutory three-judge Court dismissing their complaint, they appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.096" offset="435806">The Court has reserved the question of its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.047" offset="475512">So far as it concerns the jurisdiction of this Court to review the order of dismissal, there is no dispute in the briefs that such jurisdiction does exist but the appellees contend, as the lower Court held, that by reason of certain events brought about solely by the intervening railroad defendants after the suit had been pending for about four months, which I shall describe, there ceased to be a case or controversy within the judicial power of the United States and that since in their view, judicial power to grant injunctive relief had been ousted, there was no judicial power to grant the declaratory relief which the complaint also sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.311" offset="868603">This complaint attacked a series of fore-orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission authorizing the rail competitors of these water carrier appellants to charge lower rates for longer hauls, attacked those fore-orders as instances of what the complaint challenged as a continuing and unlawful practice of the Commission to enter such orders authorizing rates, lower rates for longer haul in competition with water carriers, without any findings of fact and without even setting the date for the hearing, under which the Commission contemporaneously ordered the issues of fact to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.592" offset="1181759">The same issues of fact upon which the correctness of its order, already entered depended.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.955" offset="1235153">The Commission's answer in the Court below admitted that practice on both counts, the absence of findings, the absence of a hearing when the order was entered affecting rights immediately, the hearing being contemporarily -- contemporaneously ordered to decide the issues on which the order depended, it defended that practice as entirely lawful in every respect, both with respect to the absence of findings and with respect to the hearing point.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.327" offset="1444655">These orders which are thus entered in that way by admission of the answer, a continuing practice, are called temporary but they changed the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.910" offset="1523022">The last for months or years they are final legislative acts for the period of their duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.286" offset="1564505">They are the diametrical opposite of the relief traditionally granted by Courts of Chancery to preserve the status quo pending a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.149" offset="1647992">Their repetition whittles away over the years the traffic of the water carriers until -- as the complaint alleged, the affidavit show there being no contrary showing, their very continuance and existence in the trade is threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.352" offset="1796786">This is a comparatively recent practice of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.153" offset="1851956">I have before me a photostat of page 52 of the 64th annual report of the Interstate Commerce Commission of the year 1950, printed here in 1951, on which the Commission says, “Frequently, during the past year, we have had occasion to consider either in suspension proceedings or fourth section application cases, these are both section application cases, rail rates reduced to meet water competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.142" offset="2055920">Numerous suspension to the rates resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.914" offset="2071071">In some instances, after investigation, the reduced rates were found not unreasonably low.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.992" offset="2099388">In others, they were found not justified and required to be cancelled, and then this.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.780" offset="2126451">It has been the general policy of the Commission not to grant any relief from the fourth section to meet water competition without full justification at a hearing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="522.174" offset="2192071">That was the policy of the Commission as of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.498" offset="2229373">The policy described in this complaint, and which I have just described, charged in that complaint, charged more over as being the continuing practice of the Commission, is at page 31 of the record in the Commission's answer filed on January 18, 1960, defended as entirely lawful in every respect.</text>
