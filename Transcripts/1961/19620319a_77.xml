            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="24.170" offset="200077">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.765" offset="218467">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to review the judgement of that court denying enforcement of a Board order requiring the respondent, Walton Manufacturing Company, to reinstate with back pay 13 employees who the Board found were discriminated against because of their union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.492" offset="361305">The basic question is whether the Fifth Circuit in concluding that the Board's findings were not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, grossly misapplied the standard of review enunciated by this Court in the Universal Camera case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.671" offset="462033">Now, in Universal Camera, which was decided by this Court 11 years ago, the Court held that a reviewing court in determining whether there is substantial evidence as a whole to support the Board's findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.256" offset="564433">And incidentally, Section 10 (e) of the National Labor Relations Act provides that if there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the Board's findings of fact, those findings shall be conclusive on review.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.104" offset="639770">Universal Camera, this Court held that in determining this question, the reviewing court is entitled to look not only at the evidence which supports the Board's view but also at that which attracts from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.865" offset="722840">And it may set aside, I'm quoting now, “A Board decision when it cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting that decision is substantial when viewed in the light of the record in its entirely furnishes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="174.401" offset="800998">However, at the same time, the Court pointed out that this does not mean and I'm quoting again, “That a court may displace a Board's choice between two fairly conflicting views even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice, had the matter had been before it de novo.”</text>
            <text syncTime="202.844" offset="914787">In other words as we read Universal Camera and has all of the other Courts of Appeals have been reading it.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.632" offset="965883">It recognizes that the task of making determinations of credibility and of weighing the conflicting inferences to be drawn from credited testimony, a task which Congress entrusted primarily to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.262" offset="1044459">The function of the reviewing court is not to redetermine these questions de novo but merely to determine whether the choice made by the Board was a reasonable one and the like of the entire record.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.005" offset="1127424">Now, the Fifth Circuit, as I shall attempt to show, has had difficulty in adhering to this standard particularly in discriminatory discharged cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.079" offset="1199731">In those cases in particular, its practice is to set aside the Board's finding of unlawful motivation where the employer can point the some incident or shortcoming on the part of the employee that might have been the cause of the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.182" offset="1296071">The Board cannot draw the contrary inference unless there is evidence that directly contradicts the cost assigned by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.456" offset="1365243">Now, this practice, we submit, in effect denies the Board the power to choose between two fairly conflicting views and it's contrary to our reading of the standard of review as enunciated in Universal Camera.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.884" offset="2670947">Secondly, as I will hope to develop, I think that the problem stems from the Tex-O-Kan decision of the Fifth Circuit which was handed down in 1941 before the Universal Camera and it is the fact that the Court continues to -- to adhere to the principles enunciated in Tex-O-Kan which we submit are erroneous that we get the problem that -- that we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.744" offset="2810337">Well, let me tell you a little something about the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.548" offset="2841579">In November of 1957, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers embarked on a campaign to organize respondent's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.597" offset="2885778">Respondent was opposed to the union and sought to defeat it not merely by expressing opposition to it but by such coercive nature as surveillance of union organizers, interrogation of employees and threats of job loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.609" offset="2957772">These are not mere isolated acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.175" offset="2976057">The Board found that this added up to restraint and coercion in violation of Section 8 (a) (1), and the court below agreed except in one or two minor respects and enforce a cease-and-desist order against this pattern of restraint and coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.684" offset="3058082">Now, in the midst of this 8 (a) (1) activity, four employees are discharged and shortly thereafter, nine more are laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.108" offset="3111790">Now, the Board found that these employes were so affected because of their union activity and that the respondent does discriminate it in violation of Section 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="764.398" offset="3161004">The respondent on the other hand contended that the 13 employees were selected because they were poor workers or less efficient than other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.535" offset="3217533">And the court below accepted the -- the reasons assigned by the respondent and set aside the Board's order -- the Board's findings of illegal motivation, even though as I will show in a moment, they were not without rational support.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.456" offset="3301230">Let me just start with one of the -- the first employee that was -- the Board found with discriminatorily discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.954" offset="3347205">Her name is Lucille Yancey and she was discharged in December 4, shortly after she had joined the union and let the union organizers used her home.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.402" offset="3404988">Plant Superintendent Forstermann told her there was not enough work for her.That's the reason he gave her when he was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.453" offset="3445217">She insisted on seeing Maura Sharp was the principle operating official and according to Yancey's testimony which the Trial Examiner and the Board credited, Sharp first repeated the reason given by Forstermann, there wasn't enough to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.690" offset="3538108">And -- then he added in any event or work was unsatisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.154" offset="3571963">Yancey asserted that there was another reason because she had never been criticized according to her credited testimony for her work, and this is credited testimony, Sharp handed her a Union paper and said, “Well, Lucille, I tell you.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.893" offset="3642911">I've heard that you and your husband have been working with the union organizers.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.524" offset="3673422">She further testified that she told Sharp that her job meant more to her than the union and that she voted against the union if she could have her job back.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.345" offset="3716786">Sharp says no that you might be able to put her back if the union drive fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.746" offset="3750327">Now here, you have -- if you accept the credited testimony, even direct evidence of a discriminatory motive and yet the Board's finding of illegal motivation was upset, because respondent's witnesses testified that Yancey's work was poor that she was uncooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.474" offset="3897240">And to be sure, these are reasons that might justify a discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.800" offset="3938617">The Board, however, on -- on this record was certainly entitled to weigh the cause that was assigned against these other factors and was certainly not unreasonable in concluding that it was more likely that against she was discharged because of her union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.539" offset="4049481">Now, I don't want to go into all 13 of the discriminatory discharges and layoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.115" offset="4095875">But the pattern in all of them is about the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.097" offset="4143731">You have evidence which could have afforded cause with the layoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.846" offset="4186781">As against that, you have the fact that the layoffs or the discharges occurred on the hills of this extensive campaign of restraint and coercion as the Board found to violate Section 8 (a) (1) and which the -- which the Court agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.552" offset="4305586">You have the further fact that on analysis some of the reasons the respondent assigned did not even stand up under scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.332" offset="4372668">So in the light of all those circumstances, we submit that the Board was clearly not unreasonable in concluding that the evidence of discriminatory motivation preponderated as against the other co -- the other factors that respondent assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.688" offset="4502131">And in some of these cases, as I have indicated, you had actually direct evidence of a discriminatory motive if you accept the credited testimony, the Board and the Trial Examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.858" offset="4582797">Now, what is the reason for the Court's error because as I have indicated at the outset, we feel that it goes beyond the particular facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.458" offset="4709230">And I mentioned the Tex-O-Kan case which was decided by the Fifth Circuit in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.387" offset="4744965">In that case, the Fifth Circuit in an opinion by Judge Sibley, pointed out that since a discriminatory discharge case entails a back pay remedy which may -- “The Court may impoverish or break an employer” and not a mere or cease-and-desist order a higher standard of proof is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.878" offset="4886862">And what is that standard?</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.404" offset="4900968">And here, I'm quoting the Court in Tex-O-Kan, “If the employer were to testify and the discharge was for cause, his oath cannot be disregarded because of suspicion that he may be lying.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.995" offset="4959378">There must be impeachment of him or substantial contradiction or of circumstances raise doubts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.596" offset="5001801">They must be inconsistent with the positive sworn evidence on the exact point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.350" offset="5048822">Now, the Tex-O-Kan principle has continued to be cited and quoted by the Fifth Circuit in these 8 (a) (3) cases, the Court here ended up on page 733 of the record with the precise quote that I've just read to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.132" offset="5203884">Now, apart from the fact that the standard of proof in an 8 (a) (3) case under the statute is no different from what it is in an 8 (a) (1) case or any other unfair labor practice case, the statute says that the Board's finding of fact that supported by substantial evidence on the record of the whole shall be conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.840" offset="5318719">The required direct contradiction of the employer's testimony is to the reason for a discharge is virtually the equivalent of requiring something which is rarely obtainable in these cases, and direct evidence of a purpose to violate the Act in most of these cases as this illustrated by the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.314" offset="5440658">You have a set of circumstances which point to a discriminatory motive with the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.567" offset="5477648">You have a set of circumstances which might have afforded could cost for the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.683" offset="5518085">The problem that the Board has is to assess both sets of factors and to make a judgment as to which inference is the stronger under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.128" offset="5587884">Now, if the Board's inference is a reasonable one, taking into account the entire record, we submit that the reviewing court under the standard of Universal Camera should sustain the Board's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.460" offset="5681194">Now, to require that you have to have direct contradiction of the reason assigned by the employer imposes a more astringent reviewing standard in 8 (a) (3) cases because it overlooks the fact that sometimes the employer's demeanor may along be a sufficient reason for rejecting the ground that he has assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.830" offset="5822673">Secondly, it overlooks the fact that the Board is empowered to draw inferences and that even though you may not have direct contradiction of the employer, a set of circumstances may be so strong in the direction of discriminatory motivation that the Board would be quite reasonable in drawing an inference on discriminatory motivation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2100.003" offset="8503359">I will not go into that but it's certainly is the position of the Board that the Court is talking one game and playing another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.273" offset="8544423">Now, as I understand, the Board's argument on the law in this case, they are stating that the Fifth Circuit has rejected the Board's choice of unreasonable or reasonably conflicting inferences which they contend that this Court has said the Fifth Circuit or any circuit cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.732" offset="8642330">In the decision itself, the Court took cognizance of the decisions, the opinions of this Court in stating that it was aware of the fact that it did not have the right to displace the inferences which have been drawn by the Board where they are fairly conflict -- conflicting and reasonably drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.579" offset="8733654">The Court of Appeals went on to find and state that from a tedious examination of this record, it had come to the firm conviction that the Board's opinion was not supported by substantial evidence in the record as they hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.636" offset="8801886">Secondly, as I understand the Board's contention, they say that the Fifth Circuit requires a higher degree of proof in -- in discharge cases such as this as opposed to routine cease-and-desist order cases such as 8 (a) (1) matters, citing in support of that, Tex-O-Kan -- the Tex-O-Kan case which was decided some 20 years ago and as far as I've been able to determine was not questioned by the Board at that time, certainly was not reviewed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.952" offset="8939186">I respectfully submit that a fair reading of the Tex-O-Kan case does not support the contention which is here made by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.060" offset="8971577">In the Tex-O-Kan case, if you read the precise language and Judge -- Judge Sibley was one of our great jurors from my State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.582" offset="9013687">He said that in a cease-and-desist case, we require less than a demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.590" offset="9037720">Those are his words because the remedy which is proposed imposes no great burden on the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.018" offset="9071470">But in a discharge case where there is a remedy of back pay, reinstatement and so forth, the burden is upon the employer and it could possibly impoverish him or break him to use his words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.800" offset="9134582">And in those cases and here again, these are his exact words, “We will require substantial evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.573" offset="9165615">Now, the National Labor Relations Act at that time did not read as it does now on this scope of review question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.298" offset="9208560">Perhaps, the Tex-O-Kan case was subject to question in 1940 or 1941 when it was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.840" offset="9238758">But in 1947, Congress enacted the Taft-Hartley Act and inserted into the law governing this scope of review the requirement that the Board's findings of fact be supported by the -- by substantial evidence upon consideration of the record as they hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.844" offset="9314722">Now, what Judge Sibley said was exactly what the statute now requires and his further statement concerning the Board's treatment of a respondent's or an employer's testimony likewise is a proper statement of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.736" offset="9386297">Before I left home, I glanced that Shepherd cited on this Tex-O-Kan case and it must have been cited 50 or 60 times since 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.990" offset="9431333">So far as I know, it's never been questioned until now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.704" offset="9446170">If you read the language concerning which the Board complains and which he cited in the -- in the opinion in this very case, either the Board has misread the language or I misread the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.034" offset="9507506">Judge Sibley said that when an employer testifies that union membership was not the reason for the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.449" offset="9537181">His oath cannot be disregarded because of suspicion that he may be lying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.946" offset="9559124">Well now, there are dozens and dozens of cases from all over the Circuits which hold and the statute itself says in requiring substantial evidence that the Board cannot decide these cases on suspicion and surmise but that the Board must have substantial evidence, evidence which it may credit and rely upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.961" offset="9643238">True, the Board may draw -- draw inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.242" offset="9656299">We do not condemn that the Consolidated Copper case, Nevada Consolidated Copper case is completely out of date in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.429" offset="9689109">We concede that the Board as in effect finds to must have the right to draw inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.117" offset="9711888">But those inferences must be reasonable and they must be supported by some facts in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.900" offset="9742921">By the same token, simply because the Board can draw an inference, that does not enable the Board to state its entire case on an inference which from a review of the record as a whole does not hold up or is not considered substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.819" offset="9810631">But to go back to the Tex-O-Kan case, Judge Sibley stated, “There must be impeachment of him or substantial contradiction or if circumstances raised doubts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.053" offset="9871548">They must be inconsistent with the positive sworn testimony on the exact point.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.631" offset="9893909">Now, what he was saying there was, not that the Board has got to have positive sworn testimony on the exact thought but that if the Board relies upon circumstances which raised doubt, they must be inconsistent with the positive sworn testimony of the employer, therein lies the misconstruction of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.257" offset="9968410">If you read it in that regard, certainly it cannot be said to be a misconstruction of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.506" offset="9997354">Certainly, if the Board is going to rely upon circumstances, they should be inconsistent the positive testimony of the employer in that regard and should not be some completely unrelated set of circumstances which throw no light upon that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3494.322" offset="14080711">And the Board simply had not provided substantial evidence in the record to support his findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.683" offset="14278092">I'm referring to the Fant Milling case, but the Fant Milling case is an -- is an illustration of what this Court is done up to now with these cases and that is that they review the record is the function of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.195" offset="14336188">Congress offered to put that responsibility upon the Court of Appeals and in 1947, they attempted to put added responsibility upon them in order to ensure the families in reasonableness of their orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.408" offset="14381014">This Court in Fant Milling suggested to the Fifth Circuit first rule in Footnote 10 that this is not the place to review the records, cited Pittsburgh Steamship and then stated that we will remand the case back to the Fifth Circuit but if the facts which were brought out in the dissenting opinion are true then possibly the thing should be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.052" offset="14467532">Well, the case went back to the Fifth Circuit and they enforced it per curiam without a dissent or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.086" offset="14491669">Prior to the time Fant Milling came here, there had been no decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.545" offset="14509537">There was merely a dissenting opinion or a special concurring opinion by Judge Hutchenson which suggested and he didn't think that there was substantial evidence in that record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.664" offset="14554049">Now in closing, I would like to suggest to this Court what I consider the real issue in this case and what I -- I think is the possible result if the Board's contention is followed and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.430" offset="14613086">If you take that contention to its logical conclusion, it will mean that anytime the Board makes out a prima facie case and in this case, a prima facie case would be union membership or activities, competent knowledge, and some anti-union animus on the part of the company, that there would be no circumstances under which the Court of Appeals could reverse them and that's what they are in effect saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.733" offset="14706291">And they criticized the Fifth Circuit in the Frosty Morn case which came out in November for taking issue with them there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.829" offset="14734712">The Fifth Circuit said that it's true if the evidence on the Board's side is reasonably equal to the evidence on the employer's side, we can't upset it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.242" offset="14772328">But if there's evidence to prove that an employee has given just cause for his discharge, then just because there's evidence to support the Board there, does not mean we can't upset it because if there is just cause for discharge and the man is discharged, there can be no discrimination because anyone who committed those acts would have been discharged.</text>

            <text syncTime="3801.397" offset="15308988">Then you've got to layoff somebody else because it must be remembered that the layoff itself was stipulated to be economically necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.176" offset="15344097">So you've got a layoff which is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.500" offset="15353396">Somebody's got to be laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.997" offset="15359352">Now, what the Board has told us is that in every one of these cases, nine of them, that's all we were charged with on the layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.962" offset="15391222">You've got to keep all nine of them although there is no evidence in this record which would justify at least seven of them being kept under any circumstances except that they found an anti-union motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.842" offset="15446706">That's not what the law was designed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.812" offset="15454647">It was not designed to promote discrimination in favor of union members anymore than it was designed to promote discrimination against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.332" offset="15488711">I appreciate your attention, thank you.</text>
