            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Terris</label>
            <text syncTime="18.884" offset="181154">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.622" offset="192125">This case is here on direct appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, under 28 U.S.C. Section 1252, which provides for the direct appeal -- for direct appeal to this Court when a federal statute has been held to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.470" offset="271537">The facts in this case have been stipulated and are entirely undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.128" offset="294212">Respondent was born in United States in 1922, and thereby became the citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.522" offset="323782">He was at the same time a citizen of Mexico, because both of his parents were Mexican citizens and he is until this day still a National Citizen of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.882" offset="373206">Respondent registered for the draft in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.605" offset="388043">In the Fall of 1942, he left the United States for Mexico as the stipulation in this case states for the sole purpose of evading and avoiding training and service in the armed forces of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.652" offset="452305">The stipulation further states the respondent remained in Mexico until November 1, 1946, for the same purpose, stipulation is on pages 33 to 34 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.878" offset="513222">Meanwhile, on September 27, 1944 Congress enacted Section 401(j) of the Nationality Act of 1940, which provides for the expatriation of any citizen departing from or remaining outside of the jurisdiction of the United States in time of war or during a period declared by the President to be a period of national emergency, for the purpose of evading or avoiding training and service in the land or naval forces of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.344" offset="642999">And after respondent returned to United States in 1946, he pleaded guilty to draft evasion in 1947, and was sentenced to imprisonment for a year and a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.694" offset="692422">Deportation proceedings were then brought against respondent on the ground that he had expatriated himself, and he voluntarily returned to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.653" offset="732233">Respondent re-entered the United States in 1952, and new deportation proceedings were brought against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.960" offset="757519">After he was ordered deported and the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed his appeal he brought this action to have himself declared an American citizen on the ground of Section 401(j) was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.511" offset="815720">The District Court found that respondent came within the terms of Section 401(j), because he had remained abroad after the passage of the Act with a purpose of evading the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.088" offset="862009">The District Court further found that the statute was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.669" offset="880295">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed and the respondent petitioned this Court for certiorari in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.254" offset="910701">The case was held for almost two years pending the determination by this Court of Perez versus Brownell, and Trop v. Dulles.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.104" offset="942048">As is this Court remembers in the Perez case, this Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 401(e) of the Nationality Act of 1940, a statute which provided for the expatriation of American citizens who voted in foreign elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.843" offset="1005056">In the Trop case this Court held that Section 401(g) of the Nationality Act was unconstitutional, a statute which provided for the expatriation of deserters in war time, although there was no majority opinion for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.704" offset="1060435">The case -- this case Mendoza-Martinez case was then remanded to the District Court for reconsideration in light of the Trop case, this Court’s decision in the Trop case.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.714" offset="1104530">The District Court this time held that Section 401(j) was unconstitutional, because it believed that the Trop case was controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.783" offset="1148834">The case again came to this Court, it was argued and this Court sua sponte remanded the case again to the District Court for consideration whether the government was collaterally estopped from asserting that respondent had expatriated himself because of respondent's 1947 conviction for draft evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.607" offset="1224066">On remand the District Court held that there was no collateral estoppel and reasserted that the statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.263" offset="1258757">This Court then noted the probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.193" offset="1270460">The case was argued last Spring and then set for re-argument in this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.043" offset="1289790">There are two issues in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="297.546" stopTime="306.779">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="297.546" offset="1295851">Mr. Terris, may I ask you, if your position would be the same if this man were not a dual national?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="306.779" stopTime="312.433">
            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Terris</label>
            <text syncTime="306.779" offset="1332736">Your Honor, we think the statute is constitutional as applied both to dual nationals and to stateless persons.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="312.433" stopTime="315.099">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="312.433" offset="1355410">Is that the administrative effect being given to it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="315.099" stopTime="435.407">
            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Terris</label>
            <text syncTime="315.099" offset="1366068">That is the administrative effect in that and Mr. Cort was involved in the next case to be argued here today is a stateless person.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.667" offset="1408282">However we think that at the very least this applied to dual nationals is constitutional, but I do want to emphasize very strongly, we think it's constitution as applied to all American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.154" offset="1454257">As I mentioned there are two issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.595" offset="1464079">There is first the non-constitutional issue; whether respondent's 1947 conviction for draft evasion has a collateral estoppel effect in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.155" offset="1502323">And the second and the constitutional issue, which the government appealed to this Court is whether Section 401(j) is in violation of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.231" offset="1546626">Turning first to the issue of collateral estoppel; the basic principal of collateral estoppel was that parties are bound in subsequent litigation involving a different basic cause of action as to a fact which has been explicitly determined or at least necessarily determined in the prior litigation between the same parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.625" offset="1632203">And this is significantly different than the principles of res judicata for that principle bars entirely the prosecution of a second action, based upon the same claim as an earlier litigation and applies not only to issues which are actually litigated, but as to any issue which could have been litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.362" offset="1711093">Now applying the principles of collateral estoppel here, we submit that there is not a slightest doubt that the issue of respondent's citizenship was not actually litigated and determined in the 1947 conviction of respondent for draft evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.640" offset="1780265">Respondent pleaded guilty to the first count of the three count indictment and that count states and the indictment is on pages 24 to 26 of the record, that count states the respondent was a male person within the class made subject to Selective Service.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="435.407" stopTime="446.389">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="435.407" offset="1847243">If the government's position is right, that the violation of the act automatically deprives a person's citizenship, he wasn't a citizen at the time, was he?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="446.389" stopTime="479.536">
            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Terris</label>
            <text syncTime="446.389" offset="1891234">He was not a citizen at the time he was convicted, that's right Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.421" offset="1907325">But our argument is -- just about say Section 3, first of all our answer to that and I will come a little more fully to it in a minute, is that his liability under the statute came when he violated the Draft Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.924" offset="1973363">Now he may not have continued to be liable in 1947, that -- it's not important whether he was liable at the time he was convicted, it's important whether he was liable under the Act at the time he committed the offense.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Terris</label>
            <text syncTime="488.890" offset="2061239">Well, probably yes Your Honor because Section 3 of the Selective Service Act makes the act applicable both to citizens and to resident aliens alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.790" offset="2104811">So that --</text>

            <text syncTime="505.709" offset="2128530">He was at least a -- he was at least a resident up until the time he left the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.798" offset="2148801">Now he may have continued to be a resident and that's one of the reasons we think there is no collateral estoppel here.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.174" offset="2170326">The fact that he was outside the United States does not establish that he was no longer a resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.849" offset="2189030">For example, for all we know he may have continued to have a house here.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.257" offset="2206688">There is nothing in the record either in this case or in the 1947 conviction as to any facts which show that he gave up residence in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.420" offset="2247335">Residence would depend upon a whole serious of facts such as whether he established a home in Mexico, as opposed to traveling around and similar evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="817.053" offset="3373839">That the remaining in the country was to be considered surplusage and one of the reasons that we think this is true is that count one does not say that he remained abroad for the purpose of evading the draft, which would be required if that was one of the allegations on which he was convicted in contrast to saying that he left the country for evade -- for the purpose of evading the draft.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.765" offset="3556696">I like to break this issue into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.763" offset="3572683">First I'd like to discuss whether there was any source of substantive power in the Constitution on which this statute may be based.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.010" offset="3609673">Second after showing, we believe that such a power does exist, I will discuss whether either the limitations of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, restricts Congress, prevents Congress from exercising its substitutive powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.796" offset="3684801">But before discussing these broad issues I would like to emphasize the two basic principles underlying the government's entire argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.741" offset="3720641">The first principle is as this Court has repeatedly held, there is an extremely strong presumption that any statute which has been passed by Congress is a coordinate branch of the Federal Government, that such a statute is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.887" offset="3781245">And the second principle is that a constitutionality of a statute depends not on any views as to its prudence or to its wisdom, but on whether Congress had the constitutional power to pass it.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.137" offset="3838192">As to the substantive power of Congress to pass Section 401(j), in the Perez case which this Court decided less than five years ago, this Court held that Congress has the power to expatriate American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.102" offset="3910081">The standard laid down by the Court for testing such a statute was that a rational nexus must exist between the content of the specific power in Congress and the action of Congress in carrying that power into execution or stating this same thought in terms of the Necessary and Proper Clause of Article One of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.174" offset="4002345">The question is whether the particular statute is necessary and proper for carrying into execution powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="985.820" offset="4048948">The government believes the Section 401(j) has a rational nexus and is necessary and proper to three powers conferred on Congress by the Constitution, the war power, the power over foreign affairs and the inherent power of every sovereign nation over its own citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.415" offset="4135361">We think it needs extremely little demonstration that Congress has broad authority under the war power to legislate concerning the draft, more broadly concerning recruitment of men in periods of war or national emergency, which is the only period which Section 401(j) covers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.760" offset="4212683">The legislative history of this statute makes clear that both the executive branch and Congress were vitally concerned during World War II with the loss of manpower through citizens leaving the country to evade the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.862" offset="4273079">Attorney General Bill told Congress, and this is the letter which underlies this statute, that over 800 draft evaders had left the United States for Mexico by 1944 from the western district of Texas alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.486" offset="7615603">He deserted in a country which was under American occupation or at least -- there was no possibility of any conflict in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.597" offset="7648099">Now it may be -- I really -- our cases which one could be a deserter and could involve foreign affairs problems, but this Court emphasized what Mr. Justice Brennan emphasized that the statute was not directed to foreign affairs problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.595" offset="7720092">Now secondly in Perez, this Court emphasized that the voting of American citizens in foreign elections embarrassed United States and therefore, taking away citizenship ended the problem as I have indicated as to at least two of the problems involved in draft evaders leaving for foreign countries, the taking away of citizenship, hence that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.894" offset="7801281">Third Mr. Justice Brennan, noted in the Trop case that expatriation appeared to have a little additional effect in detouring deserters for expatriation could only occur after there's been a court-martial and the court-martial have the power to impose long imprisonment or even death.I</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.824" offset="7872961">n contrast, this statute does not apply to people who have been convicted by a court-martial by any other Court of Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.299" offset="7902845">It applies only to people who are outside the United States and it cannot be extradited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.265" offset="7922698">Therefore the only remedy that they -- obviously they could not be punished at all, certainly not by death and the only remedy that Congress had before is the possibility of expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.405" offset="7975256">And finally, Justice Brennan again in the Trop case noted that the loss of citizenship was severe and particularly that statelessness would likely be solved and he therefore suggested that these facts indicated there should be a stronger connection between expatriation and the power conferred by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.247" offset="8070656">But the severity of this statute is substantially less than the severity of the desertion statute involved in the Trop case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.246" offset="8102630">Here as I've indicated that normal situation is that of a dual national who still as a citizen of the country in which he himself took refuge</text>

            <text syncTime="2721.407" offset="10991250">However, we think that as to dual nationals there is even more clearly, was it reasonable for Congress to say that people in this situation have chosen their country of primary allegiance, whatever their subjective intention is, it's immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.028" offset="11053735">Their subjective intention maybe that they like the United States better than Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.457" offset="11071498">But as a matter of the objective facts that they have chosen, they have manifested allegiance to another country and that as applied to Mendoza-Martinez and the large group of people that -- the largest group of people under the statute, Congress could reasonably find that they had a stronger allegiance to another country and should not be allowed to have -- to continue to have American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.241" offset="11186646">In summary on this point we think that what Congress determined here whether the person was a dual national or not however, in either event, what Congress has said is that these people have given up all meaningful allegiance to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.692" offset="11252474">And therefore the United States need not continue to give the benefits of American citizenship to people of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.778" offset="11284762">We think that Congress can reasonably say such a person who abandons his country in foul weather cannot obtain the benefits of citizenship in fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.690" offset="11320393">And this is approximately what Attorney General Biddle told the Congress in submitting this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.184" offset="11346411">He said that persons who are unwilling to perform their duty to their country and abandon it during its time of need are much less worthy of citizenship than are persons who become expatriated on any of the existing grounds, and of course existing grounds were those which were in the original 1940 Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.444" offset="11419449">And the same kind of statement was made by Congressmen Dickstein, the sponsor of the bill in the house on the floor of the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.802" offset="11452886">Now again I'd like to pause and emphasize the similarity of this -- of the connection between 401(j) to the inherent powers over citizenship that existed in Perez and the dissimilarity as far as this connection is concerned with the statute, the desertion statute in Trop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.466" offset="11535537">In Trop Mr. Justice Brennan said that desertion is often a technical offense and indeed in the Trop case itself, the particular person involved, might well be regarded as merely a technical violation of the desertion laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.420" offset="14131377">Well certainly in terms in the first instance that's right Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.631" offset="14156141">However, the power of nationality in the Federal Government, in the government, in the nation as a whole, in the confederation before we think was passed, as I say directly under Curtiss-Wright to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.454" offset="14223433">Now, I agree with you Your Honor that it comes from the same source just like the foreign affairs power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.472" offset="14243599">I'm only emphasizing the difference for one purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.119" offset="14254153">I'm assuming arguendo for this point that there was no conflict with Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.749" offset="14276618">There would be no conflict with Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.152" offset="14286231">Even so we think that the Federal Government has the power of deciding, the Congress has the power of deciding, the people that so manifest lack of allegiance to the United States and even allegiance to a foreign country may have their citizenship taken away just as they -- because they have broken the compact in essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.445" offset="14367420">Turning briefly to the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, our argument is based on the fact which we think is relatively clear that this statute was not intended to impose punishment, and we think the applicable standard was laid down by this Court very recently in forming a nester.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.841" offset="14445056">And there the Court stated that only the clearest proof could suffice to establish the unconstitutionally of a statute on the ground that a punitive purpose in fact lay behind the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.555" offset="14487896">Judicial inquires and the congressional motives are at best a hazardous matter and when that inquiry seeks to go behind objective manifestations becomes a dubious affair indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.158" offset="14530319">Moreover, the presumption of constitutionality with which this enactment like any other comes to us, forbids us lightly to choose that reading of the statute's setting which will invalidate it over that which will save it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.047" offset="14581833">Now, this Court has held in many cases that even very severe harm coming to individuals is not punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.226" offset="14610568">The Court has held deportation is not punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.630" offset="14620181">Denaturalization which is very similar after all to expatriation in as to its effect is not punishment, disbarment and as I have indicated, the fraud penalties as they are called in tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.373" offset="14675142">Therefore, we think these cases and especially in Flemming and Nestor established that even very severe measures do not constitute punishment if Congress is regulating an area within its substantive powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.163" offset="14734283">Now, I have argued extensively that this statute is related to regulation the Congress may properly exercise as Military, foreign affairs, and citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.564" offset="14779945">In addition, we think the terms of this statute make quite clear the punishment was not intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.733" offset="14804605">It is unlike the Trop statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.684" offset="14816412">Here the statute does not depend on conviction by any Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.058" offset="14833862">In fact it doesn't even depend in the same elements of a crime for which a Court can convict because as I have emphasized draft evasion does not constitute ground for expatriation only if a person leaves the country or remains aboard for the purpose of evading the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.024" offset="14913797">And finally Your Honors, we think that unlike in Trop there was a considerable basis in Trop for saying that desertion statute was the same as the 1865 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.135" offset="14966251">In 1865 statute there was fair amount of evidence that it wasn't intended for purposes of punishment and the legislative history of the desertion statute in 1940 shows that it was a continuation of the 1865 statute that is not true of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.416" offset="15019332">This statute was not even in existence from 1940 until 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.062" offset="15045872">The draft evasion statute in 1865 was repealed in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.465" offset="15063531">In 1944 on the basis of new purposes and new problems, Congress enacted this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.677" offset="15092370">Now, Attorney General Biddle alluded to the fact that there was a precedent that there had been a statute of this kind before, but he did not say that this statute was merely for the same purpose and had -- and was a continuation of the earlier statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.347" offset="15151093">We therefore submit that the judgment involved should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3769.887" offset="15185157">Mr. Chief Justice, honorable members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.816" offset="15200935">As seven members of the Court know I have been with this case for sometime and looking at it simply from the point of view of one who has become deeply interested in the constitutional problem, naturally I would hope that we will reach a resolution here of the underlying constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.803" offset="15292886">Unfortunately, I don't have the luxury of proceeding that way, I'm a lawyer with a client and there are very strong preceding arguments which must be made, which could well prevent this Court from reaching the constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.942" offset="15365402">Representing Mr. Mendoza, I bring those arguments with, I hope with the same conviction as I bring the later ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.981" offset="15405630">The Court will recall that the present remand is actually for the trial Court to consider the issue of collateral estoppel, which was raised sua sponte from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.165" offset="15470310">We therefore take considerable temerity on my part to tell the Court what theory is since the theory came from a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.882" offset="15505209">There was, however, in the colloquy that took place between counsel for the Government and the Court, a little confusion it seem to me remaining when it was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.173" offset="15554319">It wasn't quite certain at least to me as a listener, what act it was that the Government was supposed to have done, which we now assert estops it from denying the citizenship of Mendoza, and therefore for the purpose, perhaps of only clarifying my own mind may I state briefly the collateral estoppel theory as we understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.586" offset="15655988">There is a conveniently even set of dates 1942, 1944, 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.024" offset="15689738">Mendoza left in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.833" offset="15701023">In 1944 while he was in Mexico, the Section 401(j) was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.128" offset="15730176">In 1946 he returned to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.076" offset="15745954">Subsequently of course in 1947 he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.073" offset="15761941">Now the indictment and the judgment of conviction both charge him with departing and remaining outside of the United States to avoid the draft from 1942 to 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.052" offset="15825888">So, that a quantum of the offense is established, it isn't one day or one week its four years, 1942 to 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.283" offset="15866744">But if as one of the members of the Court pointed out earlier, in 1944 Mendoza was instantaneously denationalized then the offense was impossible for him to commit from 1944 to 1946.</text>

            <text syncTime="3960.368" offset="15947096">That's right Your Honor, but under 401(j) if it were effective he would not have been a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.449" offset="15971443">So, we assert that by charging Mendoza with a quantum of offense from 1942 to 1946, the Government is now estopped to deny that he was not a citizen during that period or to put it otherwise, the Government is estopped to deny that he ever lost his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.868" offset="16049183">Now, the Court sent this back to Judge Jertberg to get his views on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.736" offset="16068618">Judge Jertberg opined that although he could understand the argument, he couldn't see that it was -- there was any real substance to it for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.978" offset="16109578">If the offense had been committed for five minutes or 10 minutes or a year, it still would have been draft evasion and he would have been convicted of it, whether he is convicted of it from 1942 to 1946 or 1942 to 1944, which is what we assert would have been required to prevent this estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.961" offset="16193483">Well, I can understand Judge Jertberg's position, but I think he fell into error for this reason; every indictment sets forth sufficient facts to permit the Trial Court to understand the total quantum of offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.631" offset="16264223">It would be a rare case indeed where the District Attorney or the United States Attorney merely accused a man in an indictment of stealing money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.380" offset="16299227">He'd say, he stole a $100 or he'd say, he stole a million dollars and he would expect that the Trial Court would have that fact very much in mind when the Trial Court rendered the judgment in the case or at least pass sentence, granted the guilt is there or not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.479" offset="16367563">But the extent of the offense would then be for the Court to consider in the passing of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.214" offset="16394522">Now, Judge Yankwich, Chief Judge at the Yankwich of our Southern District tried the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.808" offset="16420853">There was a plea of guilty so there wasn't much to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.235" offset="16434646">Judge Yankwich imposed a sentence with an indictment before him showing a four-year offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.724" offset="16468605">We submit that it is a reasonable inference that Judge Jertberg had in his mind a four-year offense as opposed to a two-year offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.725" offset="16508520">Therefore the United States has -- we are not merely doing hyper technical logic chopping here, there was something real in Judge Jertberg's mind when he sentenced this man to prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.209" offset="16558466">He sentenced him for a four-year offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.368" offset="16571110">We submit that it is a fair inference that he would have been moved to mitigate that sentence, if he had known that the offense had not continued after 1944 or had been limited to two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.341" offset="16630982">Judge Jertberg took cognizance of my argument and he said there is nothing in the record to sustain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.665" offset="16656269">I submit that there doesn't have to be anything in the record in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.060" offset="16673928">That it's a reasonable inference that every Judge infixing the penalty takes into account the extent of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.598" offset="16740070">It seems to me also if the Court please that this Court can reasonably hold in favor of Mendoza on the basis of stare decisis in that Trop is not distinguishable upon any substantial ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.317" offset="16806943">To me the attempted distinctions are two; one is that 401(j) involves the offense of leaving the Untied States, and the second is this question of dual nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.877" offset="16869219">Now, with all respect to able counsel, I was not sure when the government finished whether the government fully conceded that this element of dual nationality is no longer before the Court or whether it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.302" offset="16930868">So I'm going to have to proceed as if it is still before the Court although it seems to me that the government conceded more in this direction than they ever had before here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.799" offset="16976843">But first let me turn to the other branch of the attempted distinctions from Trop leaving the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.818" offset="17012892">It's been pointed out before and the Chief Justice has been one of those who has pointed it out, that the tax evader, the thief or anybody else leaving the United States is essentially on no different ground if international problems are created.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.485" offset="17083632">They're probably going to be created by the presence of such an offender now within those borders and as Judge Jertberg as I crossed to point out, there is no showing here, but that Mendoza was not a peaceful resident of Mexico throughout his term there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.022" offset="17169732">So that I submit that it is very difficult to see that the leaving of United States injects an element into this case which should distinguish it from Trop.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.901" offset="17233261">It seems dubious that the government had anything like that in mind in the first place, if the Court pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.606" offset="17256040">Let's look at how they framed the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.949" offset="17269415">They didn't say any person entering any foreign state shall commit something, they simply said leave the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.724" offset="17312569">Now, that could mean going out in the middle of Lake Michigan for all of that and I hope the Court won't take me as being facetious, but it could mean that going beyond the 10 mile, limited an ocean going vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.123" offset="17366172">If the government seriously was concerned with the presence of these draft evaders within some foreign state, it would seem reasonable that they would have said so and if they wouldn't have picked this awkward phraseology in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.693" offset="17436390">The other branch of this question of distinguishing Trop as dual nationality, I think the Court has heard enough argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.542" offset="17483828">I could tell from the questions of Mr. Justice Goldberg and Mr. Justice White that they have also had it brought to their attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.031" offset="17517787">I have a few comments to make because there is other ground to cover and I don't want to spend too much time on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.912" offset="17545268">But should we not emphasize in the first place that this question of dual nationality is one which is imposed by foreign governments by their laws, by their enactment's, rather than by any decision or act either of the individual within the United States or much less any act of the United States government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.559" offset="17643906">The -- as I -- I've said before in this Court, the British Parliament tomorrow can pass a law and say that we're all still citizens of England and I guess we will be if they say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.325" offset="17682985">Now, are we pay to -- then say that if the British Government picks some category of us and says you are now British citizens that we are a class of citizens to be distinguished from the rest of us and isn't that all it really is to it?</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.388" offset="17747247">Of course Mendoza comes from a certain racial strain which identifies him in physical looks with those people of Mexico, but he was born in Kern County, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.502" offset="17803671">Let us imagine also the situation of the American citizen who is also a dual national of China.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.115" offset="17834078">Now, what would that mean to him by a way of substantial benefits, how would that better his position if he were thrust out into the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.436" offset="17875456">Can we not well imagine reasonably that if a person of Chinese descent went to communist China and said, “Hi, I'm an American citizen and I'm also a citizen of China” that the net reward that he would reap for this would be to be hung by his thumbs or whatever else they thought out for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.442" offset="17963436">The idea that dual nationality ipso facto and without any further showing, means that there is another homeland, another haven out there some place simply can't be sustained in this 1962 world and that it seems to me is a real heart of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.789" offset="18044834">There has been something I have brought to the attention of the Court before to hold the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.303" offset="18078897">I brought to the attention of the Court at the instance of Mr. Justice Whitaker and that is the fact that we know as a matter of fact by virtue of a communication from the Mexican counsel in Fresno purporting to speak for the Mexican Government that even Mexico wouldn't accept this man, if he had clearly renounced his Mexican citizenship in favor of his American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.378" offset="18179208">Now, it isn't competent evidence and I have no way of knowing how I could get to the government, the President or whoever of Mexico and get an expression, which might be accepted as competent evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.391" offset="18235214">I even went to the length before this present argument of importuning Mr. Dean Acheson to make an approach which he might be able to make much more effectively than I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="4544.360" offset="18283070">He replied that he didn't think it was appropriate and I certainly can understand his feelings about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.881" offset="18305222">Certainly, I never would undertake such an approach without at least getting permission of the State Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="4555.738" offset="18328628">For my own part the argument lacks strength because I don't think there is any reality to it, that dual nationality doesn't necessarily mean there are two homes in the first place, but because there has been attention given to it in this Court, I have made that effort.</text>

            <text syncTime="4658.962" offset="18741467">But Mr. Justice Goldberg, that diverts me to a point, which has been raised here in the past by Mr. Justice Stewart and I don't think that on that later occasion I did a sufficient job of arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.947" offset="18793399">What he has asked me in the past and what really essentially you're asking me now, is whether it isn't possible to postulate this entire case in term of Perkins versus Elg and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.023" offset="18845748">That is that the Government has a right to designate certain Acts, which if performed indicate without more an objective desire to relinquish nationality.</text>

            <text syncTime="4738.818" offset="19060892">The heart of this short brief, which I wrote on the subject then, is Heiner versus Donnan 285 U.S. 312, in which this Court struck down the device of the conclusive presumption unless it can be shown that the fact which is relied upon to give rise to the presumption is in and of itself conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.325" offset="19174995">And to say it another way so that there would be no misunderstanding, this Court went further and said that constitutional safeguards are not to be avoided by the device of the constitutional presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.683" offset="19228390">Now, it's necessary to go one step further into other decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.953" offset="19257438">It is absolutely true that this Court has repeatedly said in cases like Savorgnan that they will go behind the doing of the Act and find out whether in the back of his or her head, the person in question intended to give up the citizenship, but in the Savorgnan case and the other related cases in that field, the act, which was done, was itself conclusive and by that I mean simple renunciation in writing of American citizenship in favor of Canadian citizenship or acts of like character.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.380" offset="19419188">Now, in those cases I think the Government was right and the Court was right in saying, we will not go behind such a simple and unequivocal act of relinquishment of nationality, but if Mr. Justice Stuart please, that isn't what's happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.856" offset="19485121">They've tried to extend those sensible, logical cases by taking a thoroughly equivocal act, an act from which any number of reasonable inferences can be drawn and say just because we say so, if you do this you lose your citizenship, and that is the vital difference.</text>
