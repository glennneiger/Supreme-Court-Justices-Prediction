            <text syncTime="22.163" offset="192031">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.465" offset="205197">I'm appearing on behalf of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and I am sharing my time with Mr. Rice who is the counsel for the rail and motor carriers who intervene in the proceeding before the Commission and in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.324" offset="260681">This is a direct appeal from the final judgment of a three-judge court in the Western District of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.228" offset="288266">That judgment set aside in order of the Commission, which denied the application of Mr. E. L. Reddish for a contract carrier permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.901" offset="331003">This case, like the prior J-T case involves recurring and important questions as to the relative rules of common carriage and contract carriage in the public transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.048" offset="379591">He's the coordinator of transportation as pointed out back in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.646" offset="397981">These problems plagued state regulation prior to federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.421" offset="417102">They were an issue when federal regulation begun in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.078" offset="435702">They were again posed in the litigation before this Court in the Contract Steel Carriers case and they were posed again, we think by the lower court's interpretation of the 1957 Amendments which followed this Court's decision in the Contract Steel Carriers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.639" offset="509889">Like J-T but upon different facts, this case involves the question of whether in determining an application for a contract carrier permit, the Commission is precluded from considering an affirmative showing by protesting common carriers that they are able and willing to provide an adequate service to the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.378" offset="596929">The case also involves two additional questions, questions which are not common to the J-T case, whether the Commission's findings as to the effect of a denial upon the supporting shipper were supported by substantial evidence and whether in determining the effect of a denial upon the shipper.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.635" offset="785951">The third question is whether in determining the effect of a denial on the shipper, the Commission must give consideration to the proposed lower rates of the applicant for a contract carrier permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.394" offset="840913">This all began in May 1958 when Mr. Reddish applied for a contract carrier permit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>

            <text syncTime="291.558" offset="1269635">I mean evidence as to rates was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.837" offset="1286771">The Commission on its report held that in this, as in other cases involving determinations for applications for either common carrier certificates or contract carrier permits, it would not go into the matter of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.968" offset="1347271">That would restrict this determination to the issues of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.564" offset="1369631">They say Reddish applied for a contract carrier permit to transport canned food, mostly seasonal vegetables for three canning companies in Springdale, Lowell and Fort Smith Arkansas and Westville, Oklahoma to customers located at points in 33 states, and to move materials and supplies used in canning from points in 30 of those states back to the four manufacturing points.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.927" offset="1491048">And the geographical scope of the requested authority is pretty well-Illustrated in a map which appears in the record at pages 32 and 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.937" offset="1531068">After the usual administrative proceedings, Division 1 of the Commission issued its report denying the application, and a petition for reconsideration was denied by the entire Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.215" offset="1584253">Thereafter, the three-judge court set aside the Commission's order, remanded the case to the Commission for proceedings consistent with that Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.860" offset="1618840">The court below held first that that 1957 Amendments to Section 209 (b) forbid consideration of the adequacy of legal service in determining whether a denial of a contract carrier application would adversely affect the supporting shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.292" offset="1684564">Well that's in the record at page 406, and however, secondly that the denial of the application would so if found adversely affect the supporting shippers as it found, and as the Court found that they required a special service which could not be supplied by existing common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.247" offset="1768364">And finally, that Court held that the Court must consider the lower rates of a contract carrier service in evaluating the effect of a denial upon the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.218" offset="1816221">I'll try to summarize the facts fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.572" offset="1825625">There's no real dispute over them but in places they're vague and honest man can interpret them differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.075" offset="1851643">The Steele Canning Company is the principal shipper supporting the Reddish application, and one of their officers was by far the principal witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.466" offset="1893230">Steele normally buys and distributes about 75% of the output of the other two shippers, also vegetable canners.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.449" offset="1929174">Steele sells its merchandise through food brokers, to wholesalers, chain stores and the larger supermarkets.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.859" offset="1958849">They do not sell to the corner grocery stores as suggested in the Department of Justice's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.732" offset="1978284">They're substantial canners and they sell to substantial customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.386" offset="2000959">He testified that the majority of Steele's customers, roughly 80% of them, buying orders from 3,000 to 10,000 pounds per order.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.014" offset="2039411">3,000 pounds will represent 100 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.443" offset="2053099">We hold our minimum to a 100 case shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.804" offset="2066578">Steele's represent and testified that a number of its larger customers by 10 days supply where 10 years ago, they'd buy a truck load.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.076" offset="2103672">That way, they can operate on the canner's money.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.159" offset="2116002">I think that's a little bit of the ultimate economic background with some of these transportation situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.285" offset="2144528">The canning business is competitive with narrow profit margins.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.279" offset="2160515">Steele's competitors in the Arkansas Valley and nearby points use a combination of private carriage for smaller shipments plus common carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.171" offset="2208057">Steele's customers placed their orders principally by telephone and often for delivery on specified days or even specified times a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.613" offset="2249853">Steele testified that we used common carrier and straight truckload shipments and on many shipments that have a destination and two intermediate stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.018" offset="2299486">The supporting shipper's, Steele and the others stated that they would continue to use common carrier service on truckload shipments, even if registered application were granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.403" offset="2500942">The history of this transportation is something like in the Drum case last week.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.201" offset="2524139">In 1948, Steele started to transfer its small shipments in consolidated lots, in its own vehicles, private carriage bona fide private carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.278" offset="2572518">And he continued that until 1958, when he encountered labor difficulties, which resulted in a sharp reduction in his contract and his private carriage operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.097" offset="2615777">And it was at that point that on Reddish's application, the Commission authorized Reddish to perform a temporary service authorized in temporary authority to serve Steele as a contract carrier, a temporary authority which is still in effect pending the outcome of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.252" offset="2712430">The shippers testified that they could not use the less than truckload services of the protesting motor common carriers for various reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.076" offset="2759659">First, that although small shipments must be carried, as a matter of economics and consolidated truckloads, a common carrier often cannot carry consolidated loads because it doesn't serve all the destinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.713" offset="2818173">That is of the different points, it will have to breakup the consolidated loan for interline or interchange with other carriers that do serve the destinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.402" offset="2864985">Secondly, they alleged, although in somewhat general terms, that such interchange when they used more than one carrier can result in delay, increased likelihood of damage and misconsignment of shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.536" offset="2925484">And finally, they alleged that the protesting motor common carriers will handle such LTL shipments only at rates higher than truckload rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.121" offset="2971878">In its report, the Commission purported to summarize the general position of the shippers as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.253" offset="3000404">This is in the record at page 390.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.051" offset="3011584">Steele's representative expressed the opinion that it would be forced out of business, if it had to ship the numerous small orders of canned goods in less than truckload quantities at less than -- at less than truckload common carrier rates and that successful operation of its business necessitates the movement of this traffic in consolidated loads either by private carriage or in for-- hire transportation at truckload at rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.451" offset="3149197">There wasn't too much specific evidence as to rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.441" offset="3169155">Looking at the Reddish's brief and the citations which he gives, they refer the Court to pages in the record which show his rates to a few points in Ohio and it's cited as showing that he was performing to those points, pooled truck movement of small shipments at a cost to the shipper, at a rate comparable to the truckload rate of the motor common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.874" offset="3286915">Also the Steele representative testified year rates addressing the cross-examiner, year rates on LTL shipments are prohibited in the most points.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.796" offset="3334562">But later, he was asked to explain that and he said, “I mean those rates and certain occasions are two and three times as high as truckload rates,” But without further elaboration or detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.295" offset="3392554">Now, the testimony of the protesting motor carriers that is set forth in detail carrier by carrier in the examiner's report which is put in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.775" offset="3430484">It was summarized in the Commission's report at pages 391 and 392 of the record as follows; by either direct or joint-line service, motor protestants can provide service to substantially all the points involved herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.485" offset="3505298">Each of the opposing motor carriers, except Nelson Brothers, as a common carrier and each operates a substantial amount of equipment suitable for the transportation of the commodities here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.281" offset="3548453">Although, shippers have knowledge of the availability of service from several protestants, none of the protestants has participated in the involved traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.898" offset="3582934">All have expressed an interest in participating in this traffic either as initial or connecting carriers on both inbound and outbound shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.169" offset="3616057">They have handled both large and small shipments of the type of traffic here involved, and are willing to provide multiple pick up and delivery where authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.627" offset="3657853">So in that context, more or less undisputed facts, the Commission turned to apply the criteria in Section 209 (b), the five criteria that were referred to this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.352" offset="3712815">Looking at the number of shippers to be served by Reddish, the Commission concluded that his proposal to serve only three shippers failed within the definition of contract carrier in Section 203.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.939" offset="3767150">Then turning to the nature of the service proposed, the second criteria, the Commission noted that the shippers require a motor carrier service for the transportation of less than truckload shipments of canned goods providing multiple pickups and deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.230" offset="3840293">They had found protesting carriers are authorized to serve the origin points involved and either directly or through interchange, a numerous points in a vast 33-state destination territory in which applicant desires to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.575" offset="3909674">The service required by the shippers, the Commission found, does not seem to be in any way different from that which motor common carriers are rendering daily to countless other shippers of the same or similar commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.423" offset="3965053">This appears to be a situation of which the service proposed and shown that when needed could be performed by protesting common carriers as well as by the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.580" offset="4001729">And we submit that those applicant --</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.407" offset="4209037">We are now dealing with one of the most common items of Commerce in the country, canned food.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.573" offset="4229622">It moves in Commerce in a volume which I would say can be exceeded only by a coal, grain and perhaps automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.672" offset="4262013">A huge volume of canned food moves in Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.261" offset="4280404">As an example, the railroad share in 1958, under a bureau of the census study, the railroad share was estimated to be 9 million tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.186" offset="4328155">Now, this commodity, canned food, whether it's transported by the applicant Reddish or by the protesting motor common carriers is going to be moved in ordinary garden variety trailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.636" offset="4385938">Trailers pulled by a tractor and no special equipment is -- it doesn't have to be refrigerated or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.009" offset="4415404">This could be carried anything from a wheelbarrow or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.231" offset="4436302">It's been carried through the years by all types of carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.511" offset="4457409">As of 1958, a bureau of the census study which is referred to in our brief, showed the railroad as of that time holding 42% of canned seasonable vegetables for higher carriers at 19% and private carriers at 36%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.862" offset="4522820">As of 1958, private carriage had dominated the haulers up to 250 miles but the longer haulers, the railroads tended to dominate particularly to their extreme distances with the for-hire motor carrier sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.373" offset="4580916">And there's another conclusion we draw from that that by no means, all of the competitors of these supporting shippers are relying solely upon private or contract carriage, in immense number, must even be used in the relatively inflexible railroad services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.819" offset="4662627">In these circumstances, the Commission considered the effect of a grant upon the protesting carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.804" offset="4690631">At that point, it relied primarily upon its own prior decision, the J-T case concluding that authorization of a new carrier to transport this traffic which the protesting common carriers could efficiently handle would have an adverse affect upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.857" offset="4758758">Now, whether or not the Commission properly applied Section 209, in so concluding was argued fully in J-T.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.716" offset="4798255">Next, the Commission considered the effect of a denial, a family applicant and the supporting shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.359" offset="4828766">And in so doing, it rejected or certainly it heavily discounted the shippers' complaints about the inadequacy of the service available from the existing common carriers, the protesting common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.625" offset="4893863">The Commission concluded, and this is in the record at page 394 that aside from evidence pertaining to rates, the record is devoid of any substantial showing of dissatisfaction on the part of the shippers with existing service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.509" offset="4957393">Complaints about joint-line service, slow transit time and inability to arrange multiple pickups and deliveries are of a general nature and are substantiated by reference to specific instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.350" offset="5012773">Now, although protested motor carriers, especially those operating of a regular roots maybe hindered in some instances by their authorities and the nature of their operations from achieving complete flexibility in affecting pickups and deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.828" offset="5066689">The supporting shippers have failed to show that they have been unable to obtain reasonably adequate service upon request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.887" offset="5098872">The Court below at that point held the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.125" offset="5119875">It said, and this is at page 406 in the record, the record clearly shows that the shippers have not used the services of the protesting carriers because these services are inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.671" offset="5178075">The Court below also held and this is at page 410, that the shippers required special service which could not be supplied by a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.510" offset="5213393">Now the Commission erred as a matter of law in equating the reasonable service of the existing common carriers with the special service which the court found that the shippers needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.224" offset="5260309">Now, leaving the question of rates aside, we submit that that rationale of the Court below presents a very serious problem for the entire common carrier industry, rail and motor alike, and that's because we're dealing here with a commodity which requires no special equipment or handling, which is one of the largest freight movements in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.618" offset="5365844">We're dealing with an application to transport it for substantial shippers to points in 33 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.535" offset="5401475">We say that if the Commission must grant such a broad application or such a common commodity and on such a generalized showing, it will have to do so in similar cases because on this record, evaluating this record, it's fair to say that any shipper of canned food can make the same general criticisms of common carrier interline service on less than truck line shipments, and any such shippers could testify as Steele did that he and his customers would like fast, single line service on less than truckload shipments and at truckload rates every shipment in the country would like it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2550.641" offset="10305912">It is said by the court below Your Honors that the Commission erred in not giving consideration to rate advantages and that this ought to have been done and that as I understand it, the court below believes that this alone should have been determined in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.656" offset="10397968">First of all, the Commission has taken the position that rates ought not to be considered in these application cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.282" offset="10432449">I think the real reason for that is not so much that rates would then involve cost -- studies of costs which are extremely lengthy and expensive and time consuming.</text>

            <text syncTime="2606.031" offset="10527535">Furthermore, to do it at this stage, it would probably mean that all the protesting carriers would have to bring in studies of their rates and cost studies which would further delay and complicate the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.390" offset="10580929">I am inclined to think that a better reason for refusing to consider rate levels in the application proceedings is that the sole legal question before the regulatory agency at that time is a question of the service need, is there a need for service?</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.628" offset="10657834">Not what the service is where but whether or not a need exists and to pass upon the various considerations which go to make up that need and to arrive at an administrative determination upon those facts as to a need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.879" offset="10726902">The Commission has very properly said that if there is a question concerning the level of the rates that there are other provisions in the act -- the provisions that we call the rate provisions that are available to the parties for filing complaints and sometimes they are petitions for investigations and so on, whereby the level of the rate maybe brought before the Commission in a proper proceeding calculated to consider that issue and not the issue of a need for additional service or new service or advancing or extending service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3522.977" offset="14195231">And one of the reasons I think for that is that unless that was so, unless there was some restrictions upon the entry, the right of entry into regulated transportation, we probably have multiple thousands of carriers and I'm not at all sure that that is in line with the transportation policy expressed with the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.662" offset="14274017">Every little shipper all over the United States would be wanting a carrier to serve all of his consignees throughout all of 48 states or 50 or such of them as those to which he sent his goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.679" offset="14326053">And I think the Congress has looked at that and decided that that is not a good way to establish a national transportation system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3584.219" offset="14440260">I don't agree for a minute that the only question here was cost and maybe I'll have time to get back to the other factors but I think they've been fairly well canvassed already.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.219" offset="14480280">But let me direct myself immediately to the cost problem which is a serious one and a recurring one and this is merely an example of a Commission decision in which they say we won't consider cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.771" offset="14530435">Now, let's see what we're talking about and let's us look at what the claim was and what the Commission did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.679" offset="14558124">You look at page 388 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.925" offset="14571081">The Commission in its decision says what the contract carrier applicant claim and after the -- about halfway down that long paragraph, three or four lines after the reference to the Schaffer case, you will see that they're discussing the claim made by the contract carrier and he said that in determining an application for contract carrier authority, we, the Commission, must consider whatever distinct advantages contract carrier service may have overcome in carrier service including the possible ability of a contract carrier to offer service at lower rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.101" offset="14751744">That's the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.112" offset="14759790">How does the Commission respond to this claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.188" offset="14772120">Look at page 395.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.892" offset="14778911">This is how they respond to the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.690" offset="14798137">The only serious complaint which shippers have against existing service, I'm reading from the final paragraph on that page, is with the less than truck load rates of motor common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.344" offset="14852786">I don't think that's true, but that's what the Commission says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.940" offset="14867101">Even should the application be granted, they assert, they will continue to use common carrier service to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.244" offset="14892387">That's true, but irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.810" offset="14898657">That is with respect to the car loan service not the less than car loan service, then they go on and say, “It may clearly be concluded, we believe, that the support of the application rests entirely on a desire to obtain lower rates” and their answer, “This is not a sufficient basis to justify a grant of authority to a new carrier.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4013.985" offset="16159326">e.The only problem, real problem is whether this is different from the Schaffer case because of the fact that Schaffer or maybe Schaffer happened to deal with the competition between motor carriers who were the applicants there and railroads who where the protestants, whereas this case deals with conflict between two types of motor carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.172" offset="16272071">That's the whole question as far as we can see.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.487" offset="16281370">That there's no distinction between those distinctions I have made, Schaffer is clearly applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.248" offset="16312404">Now, we don't think that there's any distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.089" offset="16323688">We don't even think this Court need -- get to the problem which is discussed in some of the briefs under which the lower court didn't feel that had to get to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.543" offset="16369560">The verbal problem as to whether contract carriage by motor transport is a different mode of operation than contract carriage by motor transport.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.077" offset="16415640">I don't know the answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.185" offset="16420133">There's no definition of the word mode and you'd been in a verbal more asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.598" offset="16441762">But we don't think that that's necessary anyway because the National Transportation Policy which is involved here and which is what this Court in Schaffer said the Commission had to apply and was incorrectly not applying when it made exactly the same statement about rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.098" offset="16523786">Isn't limited to inherent advantages of different modes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.294" offset="16540505">On the contrary as the court below correctly pointed out, one of the major important factors of the National Transportation Policy is to promote safe, adequate, economical and efficient service among the several carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.983" offset="16607274">And we haven't got the slightest doubt that within the context of that language, if a type, I won't use the word mode, if I type a motor carriage is capable of providing cheaper service that that is something that the Commission must consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.460" offset="16689194">If there was any doubt about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.703" offset="16698180">If there was any doubt about this, we think it's eliminated by the Amendment to Section 209 (b) because three months before Schaffer, Congress put in to the Act an expressed requirement of the Commission in passing upon these contract carrier applications, consider the effect of a denial upon the shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.982" offset="16799326">Now, it didn't say consider only effects of the denial upon the shipper's except whether the cost factors here are significant to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.444" offset="16837151">It said, consider the effect of a denial upon the shippers, and we take that to mean what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.761" offset="16862438">Whatever the effects maybe, they should be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.960" offset="16875186">Now, consideration, one of the difficulties in this whole business is that some of our friends on the appellant side seemed to equate with the word consideration with the word decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.504" offset="16933386">Of course, the Commission has broad discretion after it gives full weight to whatever cost factors are involved, to point that they are outweighed by other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.090" offset="16979780">And particularly, I'd be the first to agree that if there's any serious threat to the common carriers in an area which is necessary that might often outweigh this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.081" offset="17023666">But the problem here is the Commission never stops to consider it and we think it's perfectly clear that the cost problems must be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.788" offset="17066506">Let me say a word, however, about something that Mr. Rice said which Justice Frankfurter picked up, and that is the efficacy of a rate proceeding to settle this type of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.500" offset="17137351">And I think Justice Frankfurter is quite right, presumably the Commission could maintain this temporary authority while it went through a rate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.127" offset="17175907">It would be one of longest temporary authorities of all time since this rate proceeding would be from five points, from four points to 35 or 40 points throughout the country involved in many carriers, but it could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.501" offset="17233377">But I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter that the main answer to this rate proceeding as a way out of this problem, is that it doesn't settle anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.167" offset="17284054">It is quite possible, quite probable I would say that what is a reasonable rate for a common carrier in the view of its other responsibilities to the public, is still a much higher rate than a contract carrier can provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.923" offset="17351032">And therefore, after you get through with your rate proceeding, you are -- with all likelihood will still have an inherent advantage which it has to be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="4923.757" offset="19798392">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please, I represented Mr. Reddish below and the -- before the Commission and I'm representing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.986" offset="19843323">I think that it would not be of assistance to this Court, certainly would not be to the industry, if the matter of the application of the statutory standards was allowed to go by the board and if this Court was not aware of the circumstance, which brought forth the five criteria which are now specified in Section 209 of the Act, you will recall that with respect to what Congress was doing in 1957, it was imposing on contract carriers in that statute, a new restriction, something entirely new and different and intended to have a very distinct limitation on the competitive impact of an individual contract carrier on the common carrier operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.610" offset="20049795">And that restriction was to be found in giving the Commission new power, never before held in 1957, to identify the shippers by name that that contract carrier would be permitted to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.183" offset="20108100">And that had a very significant effect upon the ability of the contract carrier to compete then and in the future as it does on Mr. Reddish.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.809" offset="20150627">Let us take for example, the question here just before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.472" offset="20169226">If it is a fact that the Steele Canning Company is not going to refuse to go to private carriage, Mr. Reddish would be one who suffers if they go because he no longer has the authority which he would've had prior to 1957 to search for another canning company in this area to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.837" offset="20262745">He is bound now and for all of the time into the operations of the Steele Canning Company or the Cain Canning Company and then the Keystone Canning Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.618" offset="20309870">Now, that competitive impact that that carrier can make as a result of the 1957 Amendment made a very distinct difference and what the Commission was to consider when they came to considering the impact on existing carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.759" offset="20382386">And if you will look at the criteria in the statute, you will see that the criteria is not a direction to the Commission to consider the impact on all common carriage or the entire common carriage system of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.982" offset="20443303">The question the Commission is directed to or points its attention to is whether or not the grant of the authority will affect the services of the protesting carrier, not the services even of all carriers in United States, but the protesting carriers alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.496" offset="20521357">And secondly, the impact on the services of those carriers because now for the first time in 1957, it was possible for the Commission to determine precisely what the effect would be now, and in the future perhaps or at least to make a judgment with that respect in that connection because they could now, for the first time, determine what the shipper was and who he would be now and in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.866" offset="20630862">And so, you can look at Steele Canning Company's present services.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.390" offset="20652910">You can look at their present transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.968" offset="20663254">You can look at what has been performed in the past and what is likely and make a judgment as to what is to what's likely to be performed in the future and be able to make a determination of whether the services of the protesting common carriers or protesting contract carriers although how there could be and in view of the limitation of by shipper's by name, I don't not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.335" offset="20748727">But in any case, you could make a determination precisely of the effect, that that kind of a grant would have on the protesting carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.171" offset="20788015">And the Commission never did that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.127" offset="20799927">The Commission instead resorted to precisely those tests which they had adopted prior to 1957 under a definition of a statute which said that they were to determine whether it was consistent with the public interest in the National Transportation Policy unguided by any specific criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.152" offset="20883937">The Commission applied in this case in short, precisely those standards that they had applied previously to a contract carrier who would have the free and unrestrained right to, as this Court held in the Contract Steel Carriers case the right aggressively to search for and add new contracts within the scope of these geographical license and within the scope of the commodity was authorized transport.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.219" offset="20996263">Now, that this 1957 Amendment constituted a marked departure from the Act prior to 1957 is I think crystal clear from the determination of the way in which Congress ordered the Commission to deal with the pre-existing contract carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.220" offset="21080273">Prior to 1957, the contract carrier is free to compete for potential traffic as well as the traffic of the shippers who appeared before the Commission and testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.869" offset="21122800">These pre-1957 contract carriers were to be given under this 1957 Amendment, certificates of public convenience and necessity to operate as common carriers and they were to be given these solely on the basis of whether or not they conform to the new definition of contract carriage, one that said for one or a limited number of shippers meeting the distinct needs of those individual shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.423" offset="21237112">If you did not meet that new standard, you were to be given a common carrier of certificate.</text>

            <text syncTime="5318.535" offset="21377546">The Commission never did that here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5329.125" offset="21419865">Their finances, their equipment, the services that they are rendering to the public generally, nothing in this record suggests one word as to what in any way that would be affected and that is the precise and as I take it, legal significance of the fact that this shipper has -- or the shippers involved here have in the past transported these shipments in their own private carriage, and this illegal significance of the fact that these -- the finding of the Commission that these shippers would do so in the future because of their distinct need if not met by contract carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5369.284" offset="21580466">The 1957 Amendments to the Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act were designed to give the Commission that which said it needed so desperately.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.126" offset="21619858">A yardstick by which they could distinguish between a contract carrier and a common carrier, one that the Commission told Congress at the time or the committee is considering it that contract carriers have inherent differences and inherit advantages in the way in which they operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.102" offset="21695822">They have inherent advantages because they are keyed in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.092" offset="21707734">They are locked in to the shippers operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5403.885" offset="21718915">The shipper loads their vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.460" offset="21733230">The vehicles are scheduled to go into their production either inbound or outbound movements of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.070" offset="21755695">You don't have to employ a core of solicitors to go around and find new freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.934" offset="21775130">You have only one or two shippers and you're so coordinated with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.881" offset="21802924">You are, in fact, as the examiner in fact found in this case the shippers wanted Mr. Reddish to be, the transportation department of these canning companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5434.261" offset="21840436">You don't need solicitation expense and Mr. Reddish doesn't have any solicitors or any solicitation expense in getting that kind of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.766" offset="21874395">You don't have to have any terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5445.221" offset="21884217">Mr. Reddish doesn't have a terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.946" offset="21891114">He has a garage where he keeps his equipment off.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.050" offset="21903548">You don't need to have a terminal because you are not involved in the handling and re-handling of the freight as a contract carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.599" offset="21933746">And as a consequence, you have precisely those inherent advantages that the Chairman of the Commission himself pointed out that Congress when they were considering common contract carriers in the 1957 Amendments to this Act, that realized cost advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.766" offset="22002395">Cost advantage is that the Chairman told the committee they had and that the Commission has always recognized that they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.728" offset="22034265">The question that the shippers were trying to put forward to the Commission was not that the common carriers were charging them an unreasonable or a burdensome rate considered as a common carrier rate, considered as the necessary to carry out the expenses to discharge the obligations and the burdens and the kind of service that a common carrier is expected and required to do under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.481" offset="22137292">These rates are entirely lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.620" offset="22145860">They are reasonable judged by that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.463" offset="22157249">But we're not judging them by that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5516.350" offset="22168743">We're not -- the shipper is not asking for them by that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.326" offset="22180655">The shipper is asking for something entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.253" offset="22192358">He's asking for that which prior to 1935 would have been called private for hire transportation, a kind of a transportation that is a substitute not for common carriage but a substitute for his own private carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.996" offset="22267382">And now what happened in this case, what the Commission finally did by insisting that the shippers' reasonable transportation need as they would choose to define, found within their prior concepts of transportation, by doing that, the Commission has ignored what was intended, what -- I believe that the legislative history and what the Act itself suggests that private carriage was to be supplanted by or at least the shipper was to have an alternative of, to private carriage contract carriage, a contract carriage that was so distinctly related to what he needed, that it would perform the kind of job that a regular common carrier serving off the public generally could not perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.757" offset="22482422">But the Commission, by refusing to apply the statutory criteria, and by saying that the criterion of the impact or the effect upon the shipper of the denial of this application, is in effect that we will judge solely in terms of whether or not someone can in fact physically transport a shipment of canned goods from point A to point B regardless of the time it takes them to transport it and most importantly for a canned good shipper regardless of the cost that which that will be performed for you is denying to the private -- to the contract carriers under the 1957 Amendment, precisely what Congress was intending to give them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.119" offset="22675832">If we are going to limit you on the one hand, to serving this precisely identified shipper, then we will give you the opportunity on the other hand to serve his distinct needs and we will measure whether or not you should be a new entered into the field by the considerations of those shippers, by consideration of whether you will in fact hurt in some way that the existing common carrier transportation system of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="6093.535" offset="24477550">The Commission's decision in the Reddish case is couched wholly in terms of -- the shipper has failed to prove that the existing service would not meet his reasonable transportation needs and despite the fact that the shipper resided a number of instances, in which for example, it was proposed by one common carrier to him that in order to transport goods to Iowa and to Illinois that they transport them to Denver, Colorado from Fort Smith, Arkansas and then back.</text>
