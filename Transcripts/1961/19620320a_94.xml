            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- Relations Board, Petitioner, versus Florida Citrus Canners Coop.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.693" offset="130173">Mr. Come, you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="12.192" stopTime="519.618">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="12.192" offset="152116">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.213" offset="164237">In adjournment yesterday afternoon, I pointed out that the Board found that on and after December 18, 1957, the company had refused to bargain with the union and had engaged in other activity to undermine the union and that this -- this was all part of a plan so that when February 8th came around and the union's certification year was at an end, the union would have lost its majority support with the company would have a pre-tax for withdrawing recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.689" offset="446151">Now, crucial to that finding as the court below acknowledged was the testimony of two witnesses whom the Trial Examiner and the Board credited and whom the court below discredited.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.965" offset="547192">Attributing to the Examiner, we submit an erroneous standard which he did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.281" offset="604453">Now, I'd like to address myself to the two witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.588" offset="633710">The first witness was Holly who, as I indicated yesterday, was an old time employee who had been active in the administration of the union that had previously represented the employees before the Teamsters had been certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.383" offset="728900">He had active in negotiations on behalf of the former union and participated across the table which Stephenson in -- in -- in numerable arbitration proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.286" offset="796505">He testified and his testimony is in Volume II of the record here beginning at page 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.654" offset="857945">And I like to just point out by way of introductions since there was a little confusion yesterday that the three volumes in both of these cases break down roughly this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.503" offset="913429">Volume I consists of the so-called formal materials, the Board's decision, the Trial Examiner's intermediate report Volume II is the portions of the transcript of the record that the Board designated in the court below and Volume III is the portions that the respondent designated in court below and then add it.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.924" offset="1011022">At the back of that is the decision of the -- of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.518" offset="1041429">Now, Holly's testimony which is set forth as I indicated in the Volume II was that -- while he was at the plant on Christmas Day, he was currently acting as a -- as a watchman at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.838" offset="1134738">Stephenson came to the plant to do some work.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.537" offset="1153546">And the -- and this Christmas Day was shortly after the breakup of the negotiations on December 18th.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.931" offset="1207045">Stephenson engaged him in -- in conversation and the -- and the gist of the conversation was that the company didn't intend to sign a contract with the Teamsters although it might meet with them a time or two more until February 6th because they thought that the Teamsters were a bunch of crooks and gangsters and they didn't intend to sign a contract with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.371" offset="1332851">He suggested that Stephenson did that Holly form a group of employees to express their dissatisfaction with the union and to initiate decertification proceedings and offering to make legal counsel available off the record and of the employees thought that they still made at the union to assist them in forming a company union.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.753" offset="1454373">Finally, Stephenson indicated according to Holly's testimony that the company would post certain pay raises that is on the bulletin board in the next few weeks which would give the employees an incentive to get rid of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.426" offset="1525112">Now, this is Holly's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.872" offset="1542875">Stephenson, whose testimony is likewise in Volume II of the record beginning about page 474, is to discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.565" offset="1649664">He admitted that he had a conversation with Holly on Christmas Day.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.417" offset="1681011">He admitted that the subjects of a company union and a proposed wage increase were discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.892" offset="1714970">However, he said that these subjects were -- were brought up by -- by Holly and not by he.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.698" offset="1750183">And he denied stating that the company would not sign a contract with the Teamsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.044" offset="1783515">He denied calling them crooks and gangsters saying that he never used those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.759" offset="1826356">Now, the Trial Examiner confronted with these two conflicting pieces of testimony credited Holly.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.274" offset="1876511">And his reasons for crediting Holly are set forth in Volume I of the record here beginning on pages 94 to 95.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.735" offset="1958327">And he gives a rather painstaking analysis of his reasons for crediting Holly over Stephenson.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.813" offset="1994585">In the first place, he concludes that terms of the demeanor of the respective witnesses, Holly demeanor was more impressive.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.859" offset="2058846">He was firmer and direct and stood up well on cross-examination whereas Stephenson particularly on cross-examination showed a demeanor and a manner of reluctance in testimony which concluded -- which led the Examiner to believe that Holly was the more reliable witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.023" offset="2179427">So this --</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.355" offset="9928808">It is also apparent from the review of this case but the General Counsel is seeking to impose to form the Fifth Circuit standards on a reviewing court that the Universal Camera case condemns.</text>

            <text syncTime="2489.979" offset="10063287">But this case may be divided into two parts for practical purposes that is 8 (a) (5) part which is the refusal to bargain in good faith part of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.863" offset="10110830">And it has a tender 8 (a) (3) charges which is the replacement of strikers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2517.228" offset="10172270">If the bargain is found to be unlawful, then of course there is a question of reinstatement of the strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.392" offset="10196929">The second part of the case, we have 8 (a) (1) violations which the Trial Examiner himself characterized as a miscellany of minor charges of interference, restraint and coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.337" offset="10248756">Now, I submit to the Court that the criticism that the General Counsel throws at the judgment of the Fifth Circuit applies in the main to this miscellany of minor charges, interference, restraint and coercion which is the basis of 8 (a) (1) charges here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.540" offset="10573511">This appear -- this much appears from the meeting itself and the advance which immediately preceded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.507" offset="10601409">Then he said, “This time, it was the company which delayed setting of a negotiating meeting at a crucial time when it appeared from a private meeting without benefit of counsel then they agreed it was near.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.762" offset="10662431">Now, here's a statement he made at the same, “The unfortunate circumstances of the freeze brought home to the union realizations that this earlier -- earlier dalliance in the negotiation had placed that bargaining position in peril plus the urgent deadline”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.023" offset="10743515">He threatens strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.648" offset="11018010">M.H. Walker general manager of the respondent had been informed that because of the freezes other Teamster locals had agreed to the suspension on negotiations with other citrus processors in order for the latter to appraise its situation in light of the freezes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.873" offset="11086869">Walker came to the meeting of December 18th which commenced about 2 o'clock in the afternoon intending to ask for delay in the negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.771" offset="11126471">This intention was announced at the opening of the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.262" offset="11140472">The chief union representative, David Wingate refused to listen to any statement on behalf of the respondent and insisted on first stating his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.104" offset="11179760">The chief union negotiator informed their respondent that the freezes were not a factor which would be considered in the negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.449" offset="11213197">He informed the respondent's representatives that the union's negotiating committee was authorized to call a strike whenever it's saw fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.563" offset="11245589">And he gave the respondent a deadline of 400 that afternoon to agree upon a contract or give assurances that a contract would be agreed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.917" offset="11295013">Fifth Circuit says the Examiner and the Board reached the conclusion that Walker, the respondent's general manager, should have made his plea for suspension on negotiations but we see no reason why he should have done it in view of Wingate's declaration that freezes or no freezes, the respondent must within two hours commit itself to a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.052" offset="11391561">The doing of a useless and feudal fighting is no more required in collective bargaining and between an employer and a labor union that in -- in other activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.575" offset="11437641">Now, you can see from the readings that the Fifth Circuit considered the record as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.019" offset="11487483">Now, let's go back and see what the Examiner stated about the bargain of the union altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.553" offset="11513605">The Examiner stated as follows, “Indeed, through a combination of bad luck”, now, there's no reference or record to what he means by bad luck, “and bad bargaining techniques, the union had permitted the negotiations to proceed in such a manner as to create a situation in which respondents owned alleged good faith bargaining could not be tested”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.413" offset="11640978">Now, when we're considering whether the Fifth Circuit accepted the testimony of Mr. Stephenson and did not accept the testimony went to Mr. Wingate, we have to take in consideration that Mr. Wingate was the chief union witness throughout this -- this period and negotiator and Mr. Stephenson was testifying about the same period for behalf of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.047" offset="11751528">Now, Wingate, if we want to get into why the Fifth Circuit did not accept this testimony, was found by the Trial Examiner himself to be inept, careless and in numerous cases during this nine and a half months of bargaining prior to December 18th, he found Wingate time and time again misrepresenting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.668" offset="11866049">And he stated in his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.068" offset="11875662">For example, Wingate testified that the company --</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.346" offset="12008782">The old Citrus worker's labor agreement was such modification as the union desired to make as the basis for settling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.110" offset="12043786">Bargaining had been going on to some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.521" offset="12057475">But the Trial Examiners found that Wingate did state that he was willing to go along with the old contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.959" offset="12091225">Now, the record shows for example that Wingate had delayed bargaining because he wanted to go to Teamster convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.179" offset="12120064">Now, I understand that during this period of time from February to December the 18th, the Trial Examiner very carefully each time said that this concerned no crucial matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.246" offset="12156322">This was not a crucial time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.162" offset="12168025">And therefore, he didn't attach in to forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.625" offset="12177847">But on December the 18th for some reason, he suddenly decided that was crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.079" offset="12195715">And there's no explanation in the record why the Trial Examiner would think that December the 18th was crucial and December the 17th not crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.307" offset="12232600">However, he makes this statement and in explaining Wingate's delay during this eight and a half months of bargaining prior to December the 18th, he says that it concern no crucial matter that it was not a crucial period and words of that import.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.395" offset="12300936">The record will show that the company had bargained with this union from the certification in February to December the 18th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.036" offset="12339493">During that period of time and for the period of time to January the 28th, the union at ho -- at -- used four different negotiators in the bargaining that none of the negotiators may took over had any conception of what the other negotiators had negotiated that the company during these changes had to furnish a new union negotiator with contracts and go through it, make notes for them so that they would know what it transpired in the previous bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.194" offset="12472195">There's testimony here by Mr. Wingate in which he claimed that he furnished a company proposal in which the Trial Examiner himself said that it was apparent that Mr. Wingate was in error, had not furnished us with the proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.715" offset="12530186">The transcript will show and the testimony will show that even though company representatives had traveled 400 miles to attend a bargaining session that even though the union was present in the town that they refused to come to the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.643" offset="12589955">Either -- the transcript and the record would also show that Mr. Wingate broke the bargaining at all on October the 31st in 1957 stated that he had to get work for from the international.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.116" offset="12639796">Now, he never requested another meeting until this meeting at December the 18th yet the Trial Examiner brushes that at all by saying it concern no crucial period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.388" offset="12676890">(Inaudible) December the 18th was a crucial period and he found that because Mr. Walker, the company's general manager, did not assume a knee on the floor attitude and begged for delay in view the freeze that that was a refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.645" offset="12745958">I submit that the Fifth Circuit had every reasons Your Honor to adopt and -- and find that there's no evidence of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.590" offset="12777723">A couple of this would apply too that there is not one word or record -- in the record prior to December 18th meeting in which could be considered as anti-union remark or anti-union animus This company had for years dealt with unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.966" offset="12835192">This company had for years satisfactorily negotiated, went out of strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.297" offset="12868524">And they were doing it this time even with the flames and the roadblocks and the difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.383" offset="12892871">Mr. Walker, the general manager of the company, said in September, he attended negotiations and wanted to know why we weren't getting along faster because of the fact that the season, the operating season was at hand and that he wanted the contract settled before the operating season started yet the Trial Examiner said that this concerned no crucial period but on December the 18th, it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.860" offset="12986807">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.366" offset="12988792">I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.222" offset="12996211">Now, keeping in mind that this incident, if it happened at all, with Holly occurred afterwards their -- the records from February until December the 18th has no record of any anti-union animus or -- or anti-union statesmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.364" offset="13084818">We would found at that time to have not bargaining in good faith because we did not ask for the suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.661" offset="13113971">It is a well-known fact and the Trial Examiner states that all the other citrus plants, Minute Maid, Adams Packing, we have incorporated some of those reports in our record, were granted suspension by the same union for the purposes of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.000" offset="13199339">I will show you and it -- I will not show you, but it appears on our appendix that a similar, almost on all fours case, such as this was tried by the Teamsters and by the Board in reference to Adams Packing Company and the Trial Examiner in that case reached an absolute conclusion under identical circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.657" offset="13281991">And then to -- to bring and to paint the picture of what the situation was at that time, we will have to show that on -- on December the 12th and the 13th with these freezes in which the industry did not know whether the entire crop was lost or not for the season that the union comes in and says, “If you don't sign a contract in two hours, we're going to strike”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.867" offset="13394840">In Decem -- on January the 10th -- 9th and 10th this -- this -- the area again was hit by freezes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.697" offset="13426186">It was during that period of time that the union actually called a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.054" offset="13451577">Now, the Trial Examiners claim that the company exploited the freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.122" offset="13479894">How he reached that conclusion, he does not state when it is common sense would dictate that at the time of the freezes, when the fruit has to be processed before it warms up and began to ferment that it was to the answers to the company to work night and day to process what fruit was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.656" offset="13553977">And we would not exploit a freeze by trying to call a strike during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.370" offset="13576861">Yet that's his finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.000" offset="13583339">The Fifth Circuit didn't go along with that finding either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.606" offset="13597759">Now, in reference to Holly, which is the other incident, I think the Fifth Circuit made a fair evaluation of that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.710" offset="13638196">When you keep in mind that we -- Holly is at most a plant guard that Mr. Stephenson, the general manager or production manager in -- in that case, would go to the trouble seek him out and have such a conversation with this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.214" offset="13724191">Now, Holly's testimony cared of his own death-wound and that Mr. Stephenson -- Mr. Walker testified that he, as general manager of the company, made the decision as to the rate -- wages that Mr. Walker or that Mr. Stephenson did not and that he made it at the time it was announced and it was his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.617" offset="13833801">Stephen -- the -- Holly testified too in reference to the petitions but another employee unrefuted testified that he got the -- the idea from the other citrus plants and that he started the petitioners to decertify that union and that the company had nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.912" offset="13914990">If the Trial Examiner found that although Mr. Stephenson did not succeed en -- enticing Mr. Holly that he otherwise succeeded by Mr. Scheuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.113" offset="13959816">When that is in the testimony as all and was explicitly denied by Mr. Scheuer unrefuted it to place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.223" offset="13988237">Now, the Fifth Circuit in going over to this case considered the record as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.500" offset="14013419">They did not do as Mr. Come would held us to do that is going in and take the testimony of Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Holly in isolation and view that without re -- considering that with the whole record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.627" offset="14101922">It is our contention that when the Fifth Circuit and any Circuit refused the record as the whole, that is -- he is entitled and must necessarily read all these parts together and therefore reach the conclusion on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.058" offset="14203591">Now, there was some mention by Mr. Justice Frankfurter about these colloquies that the -- that often come in trial and I agree with him that they are informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.741" offset="14274330">And when you consider that when a trial examiner goes out on his own without any reason except to merely express his personal opinions and make statements in the record like this Trial Examiner did about a witness who did not even testify then I think that is something that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ought to consider when they're considering his evaluation of testimony of witness who did testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.592" offset="14393762">He goes the great lengths in one place to take a part a witness by the name of Roberts who was -- did not testify.</text>
