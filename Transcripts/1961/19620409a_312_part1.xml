            <text syncTime="33.950" offset="239156">Mr. Green, you may proceed with your argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="38.067" offset="255666">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.370" offset="280848">This Court has issued certiorari to the Supreme Court of Ohio in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.837" offset="314702">Petitioner in this case was judged to be guilty of contempt to court, an indirect contempt to court by a trial court in Ohio after a written citation for indirect contempt had been filed by a court, the judge of the Court of Common Pleas, pursuant to provisions of the Ohio statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.432" offset="429119">The circumstances out of which the citation for a contempt arose or the citation arose out of the petitioner's representation of members of a labor union, the petitioner being a lawyer in Ohio have then about three and a half years admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.782" offset="530474">Whose members, the union members were then engaged in a labor dispute with an interstate employer which had started some time previous to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.430" offset="577076">The acts, claimed acts of contempt on the part of the petitioner where that, he have advised his client who really was the original counsel in Chicago that the Court of Common Pleas in this labor dispute which was involved in interstate commerce had issued an ex parte temporary injunction and he had told his client that in view of adamant and continuous refusal of the court issuing that ex parte injunction enjoining the continuation of pea -- peaceful picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.247" offset="764322">That -- it appeared that the only way that would be possible to get a hearing on the question of the conflict of jurisdiction between the state court and the federal court would be if the union chose to continue picketing and the court entertained a citation for contempt of the injunction and the filing of the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.726" offset="898278">The petitioner was sentenced to jail and fined $500, the maximum amount of the Ohio law without being given a trial or hearing, which was provided for in the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.254" offset="960345">Immediately thereafter, upon the refusal of the trial court to issue or grant a bond so an appeal to be taken, the petitioner filed his application with the Court of Appeals in immediate appellate court in Ohio and the original action for a writ of habeas corpus seeking his release.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.218" offset="1076224">Immediately on pronouncing sentence, he -- he called to some deputies that he had already had in the court and take him to jail and refuse to issue a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.932" offset="1119065">In the original action in the Court of Appeals for writ of habeas corpus, it was contended -- three things were contended that first that the temporary injunction issued prohibiting peaceful picketing in the labor dispute arising in interstate commerce was void by reason of the fact that the court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.151" offset="1207986">Number two, it was contended that the -- the lawyer being a part of the rights given to a legal advice and that the use of a lawyer being part of the rights given to people who are in labor unions engaged in interstate commerce and so forth, that the denial of counsel to them by reason of this type of an action and the -- and the refusal for these or the sentencing a lawyer to jail for honest advice given to -- to a client and the subsequent refusal to give him a trial or hearing on citation, a written citation for contempt was the denial of due process and equal protection of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.836" offset="1562728">The trial court apparently took the position that previously on two separate days when members of the union were before the court for a violation of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.364" offset="1620825">They were before the court pursuant to agreement made between counsel and the presence of the court to that'd be a way to test the -- test the court's order.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.595" offset="2633749">There were negotiations during the picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.349" offset="2652766">On the 24th of May, there was a verbal agreement as everybody thought there was an agreement to stop the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.144" offset="2687979">The men went back to work on the 24th and 25th.On the 26th, the evening of the 26th, they've got together to sign the contract as the petition shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.035" offset="2727476">Apparently, upon reaching, and I think this is a fair assumption from the record, when it was done on writing, that wasn't what they agreed on, at least the man had signed, this is in the evening of the 26th, the man had signed it, the president of the company signed it but the international, who was really the certified bargaining agent here refused to sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.292" offset="2808560">And in the record it says, “Not signed” and that's the printers put in their shoulder.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.193" offset="2824129">This was not signed by the international.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.247" offset="2832384">So there was a disagreement that night and the next morning, the picket line was started again.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.847" offset="2854745">That's on the 27th.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.535" offset="2865507">That morning, the morning of the 27th, the petitioner was -- had a phone call and was retained to represent the union if necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="712.912" offset="2955055">So the petitioner called the people in Chicago and talk to them about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.127" offset="2975848">He also called the lawyer for the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.541" offset="2989537">He called all the clerks office to alert them that if the petition was filed, he like to be notified it.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.862" offset="3010853">He informed the lawyer for the company that he was the lawyer for the -- for the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.652" offset="3045961">An unfair labor practice charge had been filed that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.535" offset="3057560">It was filed that morning charging the employer with refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.842" offset="3082742">About 1 o'clock that afternoon, 1:15 or something, he got -- the petitioner got a call from the clerk's office saying that the petition -- petitioner had been filed for injunction and had been assigned to a particular judge in our county, when the case is assigned to a judge it stays with him throughout the whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.815" offset="3150660">He called, immediately, called Judge McKay and said he understood that Mr. Regan, the lawyer for the company was on his way down to his office with the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="784.642" offset="3241984">Well, the next thing the petitioner heard, not from the lawyer or the judge, one of the attachés in the court called him and told him there'd been an injunction issued against these people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.894" offset="7914977">Now, the Supreme Court also said that an individual against whom an order was issued could violate the order and if the order was void, they could set that up in defense of a -- of a contempt action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.013" offset="7991463">But the Supreme Court said, “A lawyer is different.</text>

            <text syncTime="2052.984" offset="8315277">But I think it maybe the -- maybe the one most important parts in this whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.339" offset="8332727">In Ohio, there's a -- there's a case, Albert versus Juengling and Sons, 115 Ohio State 64 which is almost identical to this case except, instead of being a lawyer who gave the advice, it was the president of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.370" offset="8424887">The pickets were in -- being tried for contempt of -- of an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.112" offset="8443800">The court learned that the union president was sitting back in the audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.668" offset="8462085">And they said, “Come here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2100.188" offset="8504090">“That's all I want to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.149" offset="8507956">You're in contempt to court”, our Supreme Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.332" offset="8520704">“You can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.929" offset="8527078">You got to give me a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.720" offset="8534288">I mean the statute provides.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.922" offset="8543065">The -- the court said that that's an indirect contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.322" offset="8556648">The statute provides he -- he's got every hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.573" offset="8565635">He has to have notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.293" offset="8568560">He has to have a hearing and which time he can come in with everything he has in order to explain his -- his situation to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.430" offset="8601057">Now, there's one other case after that that goes along with that same theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.609" offset="8613804">So in Ohio, we have this situation that a union person or a person who's not a lawyer is entitled to a trial in situation like this for advice given to -- of sound advice to violate an -- an injunction order but you got another -- apparently, a lawyer has denied that same protection to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.765" offset="8706382">The lawyer just because he's a lawyer, he's then in a criminal action because that's what it has to be is denied the equal protection of those Ohio laws and just because he's a lawyer, he's -- by giving correct advice, that's one of the most do, he's guilty of -- of contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2179.470" offset="8821217">Yes, I think that -- I think that's -- they did not say anything about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.558" offset="8833651">Now, the Court of Appeals alluded to the fact that this might have been a direct contempt because he told them, told them the truth, told the court what he had done and that might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.618" offset="8877850">But however, the court said in as much as the trial judge filed that the charges which are indi -- which are charges under our statutes for indirect attempt, then it was indirect contempt you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.594" offset="8921736">Now, then our Supreme Court said, number one, that this was a status quo order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.198" offset="8964159">This was the effect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.875" offset="8970846">They followed the Court of Appeals saying that a -- a court could issue a temporary order and without any consideration to where they had jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.224" offset="9020270">It had to be a bidden until the court got around to deciding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.856" offset="9038764">They alluded -- they acquainted it to the true status quo cases like the Mine Workers case back during the war when John L. Lewis got in trouble with -- with the Government when they -- when the Government is running the mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.719" offset="9090278">And in that case, the -- the Court will remember, the -- the Government filed a declaratory judgment action on the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.522" offset="9125491">And prior to the -- to the contract expiring because there'd been some threat that no contract, no work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.875" offset="9170840">There was declaratory judgment action and then the case was set for hearing on a temporary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.639" offset="9189961">And in the meantime, Lewis' miners were restrained but when they went ahead and -- and struck anyway, and the court brought contempt action against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.309" offset="9236564">Now, that is a true, as I see it, a true status quo question where you are really preserving something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.003" offset="9259342">It's not the main relief sought like it was in this case, the injunction, but it's ancillary to the main relief sought until we can determine this then we -- you hold everything here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.721" offset="9298213">They also acquainted this with the Ship case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.254" offset="9312423">That was one of the landmark cases of this Court where the Tennessee court had sentenced the man to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.118" offset="9351816">The Court of -- the District -- the Circuit Court affirmed that decision and a petition was filed in this Court, an application to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.445" offset="9385148">And one of the justices on Friday granted the proper jurisdiction and noted I guess, then Monday, the court did take it on appeal then issued an order that -- to the Tennessee people not to do anything in the meantime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.581" offset="9445648">While the sheriff and some people that night hung this man and they -- this court said well let -- when we issued a -- and we're the only ones that could determine our own jurisdiction, and when we issue -- that was -- to preserve the status quo, well that's what it was for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.068" offset="9507610">Well now, I can't -- I don't believe there's any resemblance between the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.726" offset="9526314">This is not a true statu -- status quo order because first place, the judge didn't mean it to be a status quo order and there's nothing to preserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.700" offset="9550137">This prohibited the picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.558" offset="9561631">Had there been a temporary injunction set for hearing and a restraining order issue, then we might get close to a status quo order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.734" offset="9594337">Well, the -- the Supreme Court of Ohio did not even allude -- the Court of Appeals never even alluded to the federal preemption doctrine as to where the -- that -- that part where the jurisdiction has been withdrawn where it's arguably or potentially a matter of -- in Section 7 or 8 of Labor Management Relations Act you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.532" offset="9685452">They never even mentioned that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.527" offset="9693497">The Supreme Court just alluded to it in -- in passing almost looking over it shoulder and saying, “Well, anyway, we have -- you have a right even though there's no violence and -- and no semblance of violence”, we have a right because of the petition says there was imminence of violence so therefore, an injunction could be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.376" offset="9784926">Well now, I don't think it takes much for me to point out what that does to labor-management relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.927" offset="9819094">If a court can issue without any consideration and when it's almost -- it's evident on the phase of the petition that this is interstate labor matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.993" offset="9851382">When a court can issue an ex parte injunction and then refuse to give anybody a hearing, well, you just takeaway from workers their right to -- that's guaranteed to him under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.058" offset="9911568">You just -- you just paralyze the -- this phase of -- I think I actually if these were to be the law that continued in Ohio, this sort of performance that the preemption doctrine has no longer in existence in Ohio because all you have to do is plead and then by conclusions saying that if you don't do something, something's might be able to happen in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.559" offset="9985651">This is going to be harmful to the property of these people without any basis for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.178" offset="10008116">Now, the petitioner, I mean the respondent here meets this question of the lack of due process or denial of due process in the trial by saying well that was cured because the petitioner read into the record he's offered a proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.988" offset="10091290">Well, I -- I hardly think that that meets the standards of due process that has been established by this Court where they even go as far within the one Michigan case where the one-man grand jury who cited -- who issued the citation, the court said that the due process and not only includes notice on the right to counsel or right to a hearing but a right to a hearing before a judge who hasn't already found the person guilty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ben Neidlinger</label>
            <text syncTime="3032.336" offset="12232704">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.113" offset="12255796">I think in the first place, it might be well for us to point out to the Court that as attorneys for the respondent in this case, we are actually, although, technically representing the sheriff of Lucas County, Ohio in the habeas corpus proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.016" offset="12331447">Neither Mr. Friberg, as prosecuting attorney of this county, nor I, as one of his assistants, were interested in nor did we partake in the case involving the longshoremen's union and the two-leader terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.163" offset="12432071">We came in to the matter when the habeas corpus proceedings were filed originally in our Court of Appeals and have then in the matter ever since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.150" offset="12479927">I say that this not in apology for our position today, only an explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.807" offset="12506572">Now, the chronological order of this matter might become important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.053" offset="12523604">Let us remember that in the first place, this petition, that is the petition for an injunction and equitable relief, was filed on May the 27th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.926" offset="12591104">That is the day that the temporary order was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.391" offset="12608972">Now, I will read just a moment from the record because I believe that we have a little misunderstanding here possibly as to what was requested in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.472" offset="12657246">On page 11 of the record at the bottom of the page item number 12, the prayer for relief set forth for plaintiff phrase that pending final hearing and determination of the issues herein, a restraining order be issued forth with against the defendants and each of them etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.433" offset="12741151">On the next page at the bottom, just above the attorney for the plaintiff, plaintiff further phrased that upon final hearing said restraining order be made permanent, so much for whether or not a restraining order was asked in issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.035" offset="12803532">Is it your contention this was a restraining order and not the temporary injunction?</text>

            <text syncTime="3182.209" offset="12832162">The distinction made between a restraining order and an injunction is not always so very clear in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.245" offset="12860374">I may say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.500" offset="12865390">I may say the words are used quite loosely and quite interchangeably.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3194.912" offset="12883048">Well, this -- this contemplated only two kinds of orders, what's called the “restraining order” and what's called the “permanent injunction”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.329" offset="12920665">In other words, this doesn't speak in terms at least of a temporary injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3209.119" offset="12939891">But this sounds to me -- it sounds to me whatever the label maybe more like a request for temporary injunction that it does for what I understand to be a restraining order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.665" offset="12978030">Well, as I believe and as I've said it to the Court, those words are quite loosely and quite interchangeable in Ohio practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.962" offset="13019199">Now, I may also say that I disagree quite strongly with counsel when he has said to this Court that it is not the practice to issue temporary orders ex parte.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.425" offset="13077086">I would say, and Mr. Friburg agrees with me, that in our experience, which encompasses together about 65 years of practice in that county, that it is very common.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.578" offset="13129644">Perhaps it should not be Your Honors but I'm telling you what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.395" offset="13145004">And the custom and the practice is, and our objection in this case is that the petitioner now in the habeas corpus proceeding did not go into court and do what all other lawyers do, immediately file a motion to dissolve that injunction to have a hearing on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.091" offset="13219715">That's the crux of our matter, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.555" offset="13229641">That's a crux of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.812" offset="13234657">He didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.441" offset="13241135">He chose his own method.</text>
