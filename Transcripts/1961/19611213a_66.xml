          <turn speaker="allan_f_conwill" startTime="0.000" stopTime="148.138">
            <label>Mr. Allan F. Conwill</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">At the close yesterday, I was discussing Section 249 of the Bankruptcy Act which has an underlying statutory purpose comparable to that of Section 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.168" offset="167999">In that connection, I would like to mention briefly two cases which are cited at page 23 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.928" offset="203107">Neither of these cases involves the phrase “other person acting in the proceedings in a representative or fiduciary capacity,” which Mr. Justice Frankfurter regards as a catch-all and I do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.925" offset="271026">In the first of these cases, the Midland United case, Chief Judge Biggs in the Third Circuit, although he was there sitting on the District Court for the State of Delaware, held that a protective committee member could not receive an allowance because a corporation which he was president bought and sold the debtor's securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.224" offset="392234">And, the court made this holding notwithstanding the fact that the committee member, as president of the corporation, had no interest therein which would entitle him to share the profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.559" offset="453569">And in the Los Angeles Lumber Products Company case, the court there held that a partnership was not entitled to an allowance for its services to the estate because a partner unconnected with the Chapter 10 reorganization proceedings there concerned had traded in the debtor's securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.281" offset="556492">And, it is interesting to note that the court in that case observed that its application of Section 249 may seem harsh and may work a hardship on innocent persons, but the court held that the rule must be severe in order to be effective and we urge upon this Court that the application of Section 16 (b) must be severe in order to be effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.755" offset="790444">If Lehman Brothers Incorporated, as you know some investment banking firms have --</text>

            <text syncTime="588.823" offset="2458624">Well, I believe the Court is aware that it has been judicially observed that the several Securities laws have, in effect, created a sweeping body of federal statutory corporation law which brings into being managerial duties and liabilities wholly unknown to the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.204" offset="2552142">And we say, in order to interpret this statute properly, in order to carry out its obvious purpose, that it is proper to consider Lehman Brothers the partnership as a director.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.664" offset="2622046">It does seem to us also that basic principles of fairness would demand that, in this type of situation, a partner who is a director and his partnership should abstain from trading when he is in this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.778" offset="2702503">And, we believe the essence of this basic principle of fairness has been codified in Section 16 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="670.877" offset="2786931">I think the problem presented by this case is a simple one and I shall not take much of the Court's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.104" offset="2815770">The question posed is whether the Court should extend the language of Section 16 (b) of the 1934 Act so as to embrace the partners of a director and make them directors so that the profits on a short-swing transaction are recoverable in this kind of an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.688" offset="2914095">Now, the decision below was, I think, in accord with the -- both the judicial and administrative construction of the Act prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.689" offset="2962160">The position taken by my friend from the Securities and Exchange Commission today is very much more extreme than any position taken before and I think inconsistent with the administrative construction which the Commission has followed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.600" offset="3037811">Indeed, I think it's inconsistent with the position that was taken by the Commission in its brief amicus in support of the petition here because, there, they said it is not necessary to urge that the partners become a director and, yet, that is the key of their position today.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.972" offset="3123284">Now, the court below followed a decision in the Second Circuit rendered in 1952 in Rattner against Lehman, a decision by a strong court composed of Hand and Judge Swan.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.163" offset="3192038">Prior to that decision, the regulation of the Commission under this statute provided that partnerships owning securities might file either, in effect, a --</text>

            <text syncTime="795.525" offset="3285452">The director might file either on the basis of the partnership interest or his interest in the partnership, and the Rattner case was, in part, predicated upon that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.013" offset="3351385">After the Rattner case, the regulation was modified to the extent that the partner was required to show the partnership interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.473" offset="3409272">He might, if he liked to, show his own interest in the partnership but in a release issued contemporaneously with the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.056" offset="3447620">The Commission indicated that it was not departing from the principles in Rattner against Lehman and, therefore, until the Commission participated below or sought to participate below, the Commission then adhered to an acceptance of the principle of Rattner against Lehman, or at least I think that's a fair construction of their administrative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.440" offset="3553155">Now, below, Judge Clark in his dissent strongly invited the Commission to participate, although they hadn't participated before, and they sought to participate on rehearing and were denied that opportunity, and then joined in the application for certiorari here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1399.614" offset="5701778">First, it's very odd indeed, whatever body of federal corporate law there may be, to treat a partnership for any purpose as a director and so we start with a proposition that it's a very odd result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.520" offset="5765413">And then, you look at the statute, Section 7 -- subdivision 7 of Section 3 (a), appearing at page 2 of our brief and we find this definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.911" offset="5819016">The term “director” means any director of a corporation or any person performing similar functions with respect to any organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.862" offset="5874813">So, to make Lehman Brothers a -- or its other partners a director, would require proof that they were performing similar functions with respect to Tide Water.</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.615" offset="5937821">There's the kind of proof, one would think, that would be required to accomplish even that rather odd result would be proof that the director was, in effect, the dummy director carrying out instructions or at least consulting as to corporate decisions with those whom he was representing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.956" offset="6443238">Now, counsel on the other side, yesterday, made a brief reference to the legislative history of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.637" offset="6473958">It's clear that it was aimed at eliminating the evil of insider manipulation, but Congress considered quite carefully how to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.598" offset="6517739">And, there was a proposal to reach way beyond what the present statute reaches and reach those who got unused confidential information and that proposal was eliminated after consideration of the difficulties of its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.714" offset="6586180">Now, I don't think it makes any difference whether it was eliminated because of its difficulties or for other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.920" offset="6611048">There was a proposal that, in order to recover, there should be proof and the proof was regarded as a difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.238" offset="6652322">And, if I understand my friend from the Commission, he argues that when Congress eliminates such a provision because of difficulty of enforcement, the court ought to expand the construction of what Congress left where there is no problem of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.349" offset="6724733">In other words, expand the area of conclusive presumption because Congress decided it ought not to include a provision where proof was required, and I submit that's an extraordinary result of the elimination by Congress of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.846" offset="6790771">In Rattner, the court considered the legislative history and, on that ground among others, decided that partners had been excluded as a result of the congressional determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.293" offset="6852524">Now, my friend on the other side says on Mr. Justice Stewart's question I think, suggests this problem, that a partnership ought to be regarded as a director but if, instead of doing business as a partnership, the banking organization decided to do it as a corporation and one of its officers was a director, then all the stockholders would become directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.179" offset="6964120">Well, that's a pretty extraordinary result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.358" offset="6972792">It's very unusual to have a corporation act as a director and still more unusual to have that kind of an attribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1744.508" offset="7081357">And, here, Congress passed a penal statute with a conclusive presumption, selected those who were to be liable, and I submit, there's no basis for extending it beyond that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.889" offset="7594924">Counsel -- Mr. Levy said, in effect, that these waivers were going on all the time and the result of that was that everybody could fill their nest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.715" offset="7634213">Counsel for the Commission indicated that this was a very grave evil that Mr. Robert Lehman and others were always back-scratching in getting money this way, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.212" offset="7676217">Now, there's not anything in this record to sustain anything of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.561" offset="7693667">The only reference to any other waiver is a reference to financing for airlines where, under the CAB, the director is not entitled to participate in underwriting fees, which is a very different thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.104" offset="7771826">There's no evidence in this record of any general waiver of profits made by insider's transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.871" offset="7798888">The only other case that is before the Court, perhaps, is the Rattner case where Mr. Hertz had a profit of some $900.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.918" offset="7843088">In this case, the profit of Mr. Thomas was some $3,000 or thereabouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.491" offset="7865344">And, Mr. Hertz turned over that money to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.446" offset="7877151">There's no evidence of such general violation and I submit that for a court, in the teeth of these findings or even for counsel in the teeth of these findings, to suggest anything to the contrary is quite wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.068" offset="7931695">Furthermore, the SEC has regularly filed with it, monthly, statements of all such transactions and if there was such any horrendous evil, as counsel has suggested to Your Honors, the Commission is charged with the duty of seeking legislation and they should do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.159" offset="8007973">And, I submit the fact that, since 1952 when Rattner was decided, they have seen no occasion to go to Congress for a relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2113.062" offset="8555604">As I told Your Honors, prior to Rattner, the regulation contemplate -- the regulation published by the Commission contemplated that the partner could file showing the partners -- the partnerships, as investments, or his own investments and the court adopted that regulation as one of the grounds of its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.287" offset="8664482">Perhaps I better read the precise regulation to Your Honor because I'm going to read the next one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.816" offset="8690604">This is the regulation that was in effect at the time of Rattner and is taken from the Rattner opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.464" offset="8721220">“A partner who is required to report in respect of any equity security owned by the partnership may include in his report the entire amount of such equity security owned by the partnership and state that he has an interest in such equity security by reason of his membership in the partnership without disclosing the extent of such interest, or such partner may file a report only as to that amount of such equity security which represents his proportion of interest in the partnership indicating that the report covers only such interest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.811" offset="8854653">Now, that was surely a recognition by the Commission of the appropriateness of treating the partner as only “only his own interest” and the Court regarded that as an interpretation of the statute and placed some reliance on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2269.781" offset="9182542">And, the Commission in the contemporaneous release, which has never been withdrawn so far as I know, said it is not intended as a modification of the principles governing liability for short-swing transactions under Section 16 (b) as set forth in the case of Rattner against Lehman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.058" offset="9263626">But it is based upon the belief that full disclosure requires a report of all partnership transactions when an officer, director, or a 10%-stockholder of the issuer is a partner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.368" offset="10660864">First, there was some suggestion in Judge Clark's dissent that maybe the -- Thomas -- Thomas could be held liable for all of Lehman profits, all the other partners' profits because he was a co-owner of partnership property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.319" offset="10724603">Now, I don't think we need to get into the complication of partnership law here, but it's perfectly clear that there's a distinction between ownership in specific property and an interest in the partnership and the partner, under the Uniform Partnership Act which is in effect in New York, is a co-owner of specific partnership property but he can't dispose of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.110" offset="10827839">It is not subject to the claims of his creditors and obviously, the profits of the partnership are not on that category -- they're in the category of interest in the partnership.</text>

            <text syncTime="2699.740" offset="10902340">It cannot refer then to something that he couldn't possibly deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.838" offset="10918745">It must be when the profit has been realized by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.867" offset="10934836">Second, Mr. Justice Whittaker, I want to come to the deputization point which you and Mr. Justice Douglas asked me about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.212" offset="10972244">In the concurring opinion in Rattner, Judge Learned Hand, recognizing that, in the circumstances of that case, there wasn't any possible ground for holding Lehman Brothers reserved for a future consideration the situation which might exist if there was deputization of a director to represent the partnership interest, and he didn't define what he meant by that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.732" offset="11094288">The court below, Judge Medina and Judge Swan, said there wasn't any room in this statute for any conception -- such conception as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.380" offset="11128874">The statue doesn't refer to deputies, but the directors, officers, and stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.614" offset="11149876">But there's a specific finding of fact by both court below that there wasn't any deputization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.151" offset="11172028">So whatever it means, it didn't exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.069" offset="11183626">Now, I suppose, what it must mean, if the doctrine is over, is a case where a stockholder designates somebody to represent him on the Board and directs his conduct in that event.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.398" offset="11528965">The question, as I see it here -- the issue, as I see it here, is the interpretation which this Court must give to a statutory purpose and inherent in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.599" offset="11589778">Congress specifically stated that the purpose of the Act was to prevent the use of inside information in specifying the three categories of persons who are in such relationship to an issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.977" offset="11675251">That they would, in the course or the nature of their duties, have access to inside information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.824" offset="11714644">Congress, by no means, meant merely to stupefy or merely to limit the liability under that section to those three types of persons mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.824" offset="11798653">It would seem from the purpose -- from the statutory purpose that any person who has access, who was so close to the issuer, that he would have access to inside information would be one of those persons against whom the statute would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.670" offset="11886007">Now, I believe that a partnership, a member of which is on the Board of an issuer, who deals in securities of the issuer and who is, in the nature -- in the very nature of its business, an investment adviser to the issuer is in such close relationship to the issuer that it must be deemed as a person who has access to confidential information and against whom the statute was meant to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.981" offset="12051310">This Court has on several occasions held that it would not -- it will not be limited by the literal statutory words of a statute but will apply the statute even beyond its literal wording in order to accomplish the purpose which Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.531" offset="12141484">I specifically refer Your Honors to the cases of the United States against American Trucking Association where this Court held that there is, of course, no more persuasive evidence of the purpose of the statute than the words by which the legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.638" offset="12225912">Often, these words are sufficient in and of themselves to determine the purpose of the legislation.</text>
