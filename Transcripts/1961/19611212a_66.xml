            <label>Mr. Morris J. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="11.521" offset="149504">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.558" offset="177612">This matter is presently before this Court pursuant to its order which granted petitioner's application for writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which affirmed, by divided Court, the trial court judgment, dismissing the complaint as to the respondents, Lehman Brothers, and affirming the judgment as against the respondents Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.169" offset="332048">The action was originally commenced by the petitioner, a stockholder of Tide Water Associated Oil Company, on its behalf, to recover short-swing profits realized by Lehman Brothers from its transactions in the stock of Tide Water.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.209" offset="416162">This action was brought pursuant to Section 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which, in substance, provides that, for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by a director, an officer, or a 10% stockholder, any profit realized by such person shall be recoverable by the issuer or if the issuer fails to sue by a stockholder who brings such action on its behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.719" offset="566209">Pursuant to the man upon Tide Water and its failure to commence such suit, the petitioner as a stockholder did commence such suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.318" offset="612603">Now, the issue involved here is the interpretation to be given to Section 16 (b), whether or not the Congressional purpose expressly stated by Congress should be carried out or whether the literal language of the statute should be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.210" offset="716257">Another issue involved here is whether or not the Securities and Exchange Commission has the power to formulate and make rules which Congress specifically allowed it to make and what effect the Court should give to such rules in interpreting the purpose of Section 16 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="179.874" offset="822836">Now, before going into the facts of the case, I think it would be advisable to go into the history of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.392" offset="880933">Your Honors will recall that, in 1929, there was a stock market crash and which vividly brought to the attention of Congress the fact that there was looseness in National Stock Exchanges, there were manipulations by insiders, and there were gen -- the general makeup of the market and the sale and purchase of securities were such as to put the investors generally in a very bad position as compared to the persons who are in the inside of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.252" offset="1060342">Extended hearings were held before the Congressional committees and, pursuant to such hearings, Congress decided to enact the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and its general purpose was to protect the investors to prohibit market manipulation and to maintain fair and free markets so that investors throughout the country might go into the market and purchase or sell securities knowing that there are no inside manipulations which cause the prices to go up or down.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.315" offset="1220629">Now, closely alike to this general purpose for the enactment of Section 6 -- the enactment of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was the furnishing of reports by insiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.803" offset="1294608">Congress found that insiders had used their confidential knowledge of the corporation to manipulate stock, to purchase stock, to sell stock based upon such knowledge and that the investors were at a great disadvantage because of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.256" offset="1372348">So, Congress decided to require these insiders such as officers, directors, and principal stockholders who could have use of such inside information and who are in such a position to get it to furnish reports of their purchases or sales of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.388" offset="1460955">And, in order to deter them from making use of confidential information, they inaugurated a plan whereby if the director or officer or principal stockholder purchased and sold a security of an issuer which was listed upon the National Security Exchange, if such transaction occurred within a period of less than six months, this -- the profit realized by such insider was recoverable from him regardless of his intention -- as stated in the Section, regardless of his intention of rep -- of not repurchasing the securities sold or of not selling the securities purchased within a period of six months.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.748" offset="2138363">In the course of Congressional hearings, one of the draftsmen of the Act testified that Section 16 (b) is designed to reach an insider short-swing profits irrespective of any intention or expectation to sell the security within six months since it is absolutely impossible to prove the existence of such intention or expectation.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.917" offset="2219029">And, you have to have this crude rule of thumb because you cannot undertake the burden of having to prove that the director intended, at the time he bought, to get out on a short-swing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Morris J. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="558.371" offset="2336893">That's right, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.323" offset="2352671">Now, I refer Your Honors to Section 2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 whereby Congress specifically stated its purpose for enacting the statute in general in these words, and it said, “Transactions in securities as commonly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets are affected with a national public interest which makes it necessary to provide for regulation and control of such transactions and of practices and matters related thereto, including transactions by officers, directors, and principal security holders, to require appropriate reports, and to impose requirements necessary to make such regulation and control reasonably complete and effective, and insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in such transactions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="631.964" offset="2631241">And, of course, they go on for about a page and a half setting forth why -- the reasons why the -- that such transactions are affected with a national public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.126" offset="2699891">Now, in construing Section 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Courts have recognized that this type of statute is a remedial statute and that, in order to give it the meaning which Congress intended, there must be a broad application of its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.476" offset="2833324">And, the courts have gone out of their way to make certain that there would not be any loophole wherein an insider could transcend the purposes of the statute and realize for himself a short-swing profit denied to other investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.676" offset="2938128">Under Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, provision is made that an insider must file certain reports with respect to his transactions showing the change of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.383" offset="3004897">Section 16 (b), as I've stated before, provides for the recovery of short-swing profits realized by such insider.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.075" offset="3047633">Now, it's remarkable to note at this point that there were certain exemptions from the operation of the statute which Congress specifically incorporated in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.427" offset="3097057">For instance, in Section 16 (b), there is exempt from its operation any acquisition of stock received in payment of a debt contracted in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.021" offset="3155466">Otherwise, the person who has contracted a debt, who -- to whom money is owed, obtain stock for the payment of his debt and, if that was done in good faith, the acquisition of the stock is not considered a purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.135" offset="3215862">Now, Section 16 (b) further provides that foreign and domestic arbitrage transactions are exempted unless, and the statute specifically says, “Unless it is made contrary to such rules and regulations as the Commission may make for the purpose of carrying out the purposes of this statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="807.111" offset="3331845">Thus, by granting this automatic exemption, under this provision of the Act, and permitting the Commission to make rules avoiding such exemption, it would appear that the Commission has the implied authority to make such rules as it deems proper to carry out the purposes in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.578" offset="3433723">And, this is what the Commission actually did.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.560" offset="3457651">Now, about 15 years ago, the Commission decided to promulgate a rule whereby a director who was a partner of a firm who had traded in securities was required to report his proportionate share of the purchases or sales effected by his firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.012" offset="3599444">Subsequently, this rule was changed, and this rule was changed by the Commission after a case was decided by the Second Circuit, Rattner against Lehman, which is in direct contravention to the purposes for which the statute, Section 16 (b) was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.510" offset="3721383">I think I can get now to the facts of this case and I think you have a history of the statute in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.861" offset="3754820">I think the facts now will show that in its application, the Court did not apply the proper interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="973.848" offset="3998804">Now, the facts of this case are as follows, Lehman Brothers is a New York partnership composed of approximately 17 partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.817" offset="4066617">Prior to August of 1954, Mr. John Hertz, who was a partner of Lehman Brothers, was a director of Tide Water Associated Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.738" offset="4126281">His testimony is that he joined Lehman Brothers in 1934 to bring business to Lehman Brothers and that he joined Tide Water as a director to bring business -- its business to Lehman Brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.842" offset="4206738">And he further testified that his joint -- his being a director certainly did bring Lehman Brothers business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.609" offset="4241847">He further testified that, during the course of his being a director, he gossiped about the affairs of Tide Water to his partners, discussed the matters with them, and that, of course, in the course of financing which Lehman Brothers did for Tide Water, he, as a director, was the person in charge of that and he discussed the matters with his partners since he had more knowledge of its affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.969" offset="4371205">Some time prior to August of 1954, Mr. Hertz decided to resign his directorship from Tide Water and he came over to his partner -- his fellow-partner, Mr. Thomas and said, “Mr. Thomas, how would you like to become a director of Tide Water?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.805" offset="4450617">Mr. Thomas said he would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.977" offset="4459290">So, Mr. Hertz called up the President of Tide Water and said “Mr. Staples, I have a smart young man here who is my partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.382" offset="4496906">I'd like to have him become a director in my place.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.537" offset="4517491">And, within a short time, of course, Mr. Thomas was appointed a director of Tide Water and his appointment was effective as of the date when Mr. Hertz's resignation took effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.254" offset="4572348">On the same date, one went in -- went out and the other went in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.945" offset="4647163">Now, Mr. Hertz testified that, before his resignation had become effective from the Tide Water Board, there was some discussion amongst the members of the Tide Water Board concerning the issuance by Tide Water of a preferred stock which could be converted -- which could be into which the common could be converted, the common which was outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.095" offset="4759803">There was also some discussion with respect to the refinancing of a new refinery for Tide Water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.558" offset="4789582">And that Mr. Hertz admitted that he discussed these matters with his partners in Lehman Brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.406" offset="4816959">Now, after Mr. Hertz have resigned from Lehman -- from Tide Water, Mr. Thomas admitted that, on several occasions, he was asked by his partners at Lehman Brothers what he thought of the business, the prospects of Tide Water, and that he had answered them and told them that the prospects were very good and that it should be a good investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.813" offset="4934614">And his testimony indicated that he had spoken in this fashion to at least six of his partners at Lehman Brothers, including one, a Mr. Hammerslough who actually gave the orders to Lehman Brothers to purchase -- to commence purchasing Tide Water stock involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.366" offset="5024789">Now, without a short time after such discussion with Mr. Thomas, Mr. Hammerslough told his office to start purchasing common stock of Tide Water and, when Mr. Thomas saw the common stock being purchased and asked what that was for, he was informed that, “Well, we're purchasing the stock because we expect to convert it into the new preferred which is going to be issued by Tide Water and that we're going to sell it to institutional investors because it's a good investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.835" offset="5210676">Now, Mr. -- these -- 50,000 shares of this common stock of Tide Water was so-purchased within a period of approximately one month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.554" offset="5269608">Subsequently, the directors and the stockholders of Tide Water did approve a resolution granting the right to issue the preferred stock and permitting the conversion of the common to the preferred stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.821" offset="5346617">Now, after the resolution was passed, Lehman Brothers converted its preferred -- it's prominence preferred and immediately, within less than six months, a matter of fact, within approximately two months, sold the preferred stock to investor, realizing, as the trial court found a short-swing profit of approximately $98,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.034" offset="5471483">The Court -- the trial court held that since the statute, Section 16 (b), does not state that a partner must -- or, rather, a partnership must return profit, the trial court decided to go by the literal language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.913" offset="5566986">The statute said, “A director, an officer, or a 10% stockholder” and the trial court said, “Well, Lehman Brothers is not a director, it is not an officer, and it is not a 10% stockholder, therefore, no liability, as far as they're concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.245" offset="5624351">With respect to Thomas, who is a director, well, he has a certain percentage of interest in the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.020" offset="5663431">We'll only award judgment against him for his proportionate share of his partnership interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.691" offset="5698121">Now, on the course of examination, on the course of the trial, it came out from the mouth of Mr. Thomas that he had waived his right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.597" offset="5745768">After the first purchases of common stock had been made, he had orally told his partners at a luncheon, “I don't want to have any part of this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.356" offset="5788818">I don't want any profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.695" offset="5794147">I don't want any loss.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.356" offset="5816822">Further, it was shown that -- on other occasions, other partners of Lehman Brothers have similarly waived their rights to transactions or to profits from short-swing transactions in corporations of which they were directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.038" offset="5919535">And, the testimony showed that during every time which these profits were waived, the other partners of course received more than their proportionate share in order to make up the difference, so that at no time did any of the partners actually suffer any financial loss by reason of their having waived their rights to such profits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1510.251" offset="6144397">So, instead of one partner getting, say, 8%, he'd get 8.2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.044" offset="6167594">And in this way, it was a round-robin where one partner would give up his profits and would not actually be paid that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.091" offset="6207718">He would make it up from another transaction where another partner similarly waived his rights thereto.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.351" offset="6316805">He said, “In lieu of my relation to Tide Water, I'm not going to take a penny of profit out of that which has come to the firm out of Tide Water's dealing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.704" offset="6346167">Therefore, there'd be more in the pool left to be distributed among those partners who are in Tide Water oil case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1894.488" offset="7681337">One way to do this was to construe Section 16 (b) to include the partnership because of the unity of the partnership relationship and the fact that one of the partners is a director.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.923" offset="11375052">Now, the testimony in this case shows that when Joseph Thomas, the Director of Tide Water, learned of the Lehman Brothers' purchase of Tide Water equity securities, he went to his partner, Robert Lehman, and asked him the purpose of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.674" offset="11454046">And upon being told the purpose, Thomas apparently stated that it might prove embarrassing for him because of his Tide Water directorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.737" offset="11498350">The response of Robert Lehman is very interesting and quite significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.104" offset="11523741">He said, “Well, you,” meaning Thomas, “had better do something about it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.689" offset="11562088">Robert Lehman didn't suggest that Lehman Brothers should do anything about it and indeed, why should he, because he had Rattner against Lehman as a precedent before him only approximately three years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.836" offset="11638680">And, under Rattner against Lehman, while John Hertz, his partner, was forced to give up a small amount, his pro rata share of the profits in the consolidated Vultee Aircraft transaction which was the subject of that decision, Robert Lehman made money and as did every other partner of Lehman Brothers, including Joseph Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.533" offset="11761455">Now, he has the Tide Water transaction before him and, this time, it's Joseph Thomas' turn to lose a little money.</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.542" offset="12857553">But, back to the danger again because that is important, it is there, we got Robert Lehman making money in two transactions and there's no indication of where this might stop.</text>

            <text syncTime="3220.371" offset="12984822">But, if they do, there can be a succession of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.079" offset="13003734">Maybe in one of them, in some future date, Robert Lehman will lose money if Lehman Brothers trades in an equity security of a corporation of which he is a director.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.557" offset="13057651">But, that won't matter to him because it will be insignificant in comparison with the bundle of money that he has made in prior transaction and insignificant in comparison with the bundle which he can make in future transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.228" offset="13144273">We say that the type of result which the Second Circuit decision will encourage is very little different than the pooling arrangements which were so roundly condemned by the Senate report which preceded the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.560" offset="13233612">In these pooling arrangements, investment bankers and insiders were often involved and we believe that the Senate report accurately characterized these pooling arrangements as vicious, as predatory, and as flagrant violations of fiduciary duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.205" offset="13348237">It is true, as respondent's brief asserts, that the when Section 16 (b), or what ultimately became Section 16 (b), was first introduced into Congress, it contained a provision, first, which barred any insider from disclosing confidential information and, second, impose short-swing liability on any person -- any person to whom that disclosure was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.636" offset="13489925">Now, this provision was sweeping in character, and plainly, it could have embraced partners or directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.166" offset="13523989">But, it was so sweeping that it could have embraced friends, relatives, barbers, bartenders, bootblacks, or anyone else that you would care to name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.082" offset="13603715">And, the reason it was deleted is because it would have required proof of disclosure and that proof of disclosure made it, as the respondent's brief concedes, a dubious administrative practicality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.325" offset="13680724">Now, the respondent argues from that that its elimination means that, obviously, Congress intended to exclude from the operation of Section 16 (b) partners of directors, but I would suggest to this Court that the elimination of a broad provision because of administrative difficulties of enforcement actually reflects a Congressional intent to construe what remains in Section 16 (b) broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.398" offset="13860968">And, I suggest to the Court that this conclusion finds ample support in the history of judicial interpretation of Section 16 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.998" offset="13915408">In fact, you have filed with you in this case a brief amicus from the American Society of Corporate Secretaries and I believe a reading of that brief and the cases they cite will clearly indicate that the cases which give them so much pain prove our point, namely, that never -- nearly every court which has had an opportunity to consider Section 16 (b) as recognized that it is necessary to construe it broadly in order not to frustrate its plain statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.320" offset="14116655">I might add that, while we are obviously urging a broad construction on you today suggesting that you find that Lehman Brothers is a partner within the meaning of Section 16 (b), that we don't regard this as an extraordinarily novel or startling interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3548.843" offset="14298781">I'm sure the Court recalls that under Section 249, no compensation shall be allowed to any committee or attorney or their person acting at a bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings in a fiduciary capacity who buys or sells stock of or claims against the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.108" offset="14419780">Now, the statutory purpose behind Section 249 is comparable to that of Section 16 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.889" offset="14454888">The Congress recognized that active participants, in say, a Chapter 10 reorganization proceeding were in a position to have access to information not generally available to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.700" offset="14522180">And in order to bar the use of that inside information, they enacted a arbitrary standard, a rule of thumb, if you will, similar to that in Section 16 (b) saying, “If you buy or sell, you can receive no allowance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.107" offset="14603786">Again, under 249, as in Section 16 (b), good faith is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.874" offset="14638895">Lack of use of inside information is no defense and the cases have interpreted this, at least as broadly as we are asking you to interpret Section 16 (b).</text>
