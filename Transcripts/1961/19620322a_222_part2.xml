            <text syncTime="7.141" offset="131950">I'd like to pick up the thread of my argument shortly before we -- Your Honor declared a recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.396" offset="168939">Somewhere around April of 1957 after we had gone through 12 hectic bargaining sessions over a period of time, we found ourselves in the position of where we were vacillating between individual collective bargaining, industry wide collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.473" offset="277295">And frankly, I don't think anybody, you, neither the State Mediation Border or the Union or those people who were sitting in as a group in these negotiations in what thing we were bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.241" offset="332361">I think everybody recognized though that an industry-wide pattern would have been the more preferable method of evolving a collective bargaining agreement because it would've established uniform conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.091" offset="383770">And that was --</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney O. Raphael</label>
            <text syncTime="83.213" offset="436224">And our members have rather substantial plants in all of these three states.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.545" offset="457540">And what we were trying to achieve is a uniformity of conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.703" offset="474154">And I think the Union went along with that, shall we say sub-consciously, although not voicing it in those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.751" offset="510412">Now, the reference has been made in the argument of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.657" offset="537997">It might have been availed inference that there was a sham bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.045" offset="555551">Again, I want to repeat that the risk of -- perhaps being redundant that we have real genuine, sincere bargaining and rather lengthy and hectic sessions that resolved many issues and resulted in a wage pattern which meant perhaps over a million dollars as far as our members will consign for a period of a three-year agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.217" offset="652204">Now, when we got down to about the middle of May and the situation became very acute because a strike had been declared against one of the members of the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.759" offset="714376">And there was general chaos and disruption among the workers which we contended on the record was generated and inspired by the Union's representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.860" offset="758784">When that situation eventuate, we at that time said to the Union, “Look, if we cannot agree amicably on what constitutes the format of a collective agreement, let us give this thing to the American Arbitration Association for them, for an arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators to be chosen who have the expertise in dealing with these problems and we are agreeable to be bound by their award.”</text>
            <text syncTime="202.995" offset="915310">Well, surprisingly, the Union refused to go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.316" offset="948642">And with the result that the -- there was a complete impasse at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.756" offset="970376">The Union wrote us a letter, we wrote the Union a letter and for a period of two months, we heard nothing from the Union at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.940" offset="1011127">So that following May the 17th, which is a local date, somewhere at the beginning of July and just about the time when the certification year was to expire, the employees were then the collective bargaining unit, sua sponte disowned the Union, notified us that they were no longer interested in having the union bargain for them collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.036" offset="1139545">But even before this impasse resulted in May of 1957, we had another curious situation which brought about an impasse and that was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.533" offset="1205478">While we were engaged in this overall industry-wide bargaining the Union went and they used the divide and conquer procedure which they have a perfect right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.674" offset="1258036">It's -- all is fair in an economic war, we agree to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.104" offset="1279770">And they went and obtained a collective agreement from the largest employer in the industry operating a plant in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.437" offset="1333164">And in this agreement, a clause was written which stated, “No other employee shall be accorded times and conditions more favorable than those that are prescribed in this contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="322.016" offset="1391470">And that was sometime of the early part of January of 1957 so that when we met with the Union's representatives the next time, we were met head on with the statement by the Union that we would have to conform with the times and conditions of this atmosphere contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.151" offset="1679966">But unfortunately, in the light of the decisions especially the Insurance Agents case, I think that the factual content of the case with respect to the good or bad faith bargaining becomes very crucial if we ought to sustain the corollary findings under 8 (a) (5) and 8 (a) (1).</text>

            <text syncTime="430.257" offset="1824371">Well, they didn't disagree with the factual findings but they had reservations about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.347" offset="1856763">But, it is my opinion that since the Court was determined by majority opinion to send the case back to the Board on a mandate, to educe additional evidence with respect to the good or the bad faith finding, I think that in effect eventually would resolve the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.505" offset="1941400">Because if we went back to the Board and we have to determine the good faith of the employer, additional evidence would have to be educed.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.450" offset="1981210">And this additional evidence would in turn supplement the evidence already adduced and then the Board would have to say, “Well, we feel that the overall bargaining tactics of this employer were fair, that perhaps he did go often the left field a little bit here and there but it wasn't that serious and it didn't amount to that much that we have to make an overall finding of failure to bargain.”</text>
