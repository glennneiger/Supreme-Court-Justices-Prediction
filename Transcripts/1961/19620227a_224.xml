            <text syncTime="16.989" offset="171342">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, I approach this argument with some trepidation after the spirit of exchange took place with Mr. Doolittle and Mr. Dietz.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.208" offset="216168">This is a rather straightforward tax case which comes here on writ of certiorari from the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.831" offset="250650">It does, however, involve the issue of how far the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may go in extending the clear language of the statute and it also involves the conflict of Circuits and that the Third and the Sixth Circuits have decided this case differently than the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.939" offset="335078">The single issue that is presented here is the question of whether a taxpayer who pays a premium for a bond, which is subject to both a general call at one price and a special call at one -- at another price, lower price, may deduct the difference between the amount that he pays or -- and the amount of the general call price.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.097" offset="455764">Or whether he may, as petitioners contend under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, deduct the difference between what he paid and the lower special call price.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.953" offset="519189">Our position, we submit, is supported by both the express language of the statute and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.516" offset="553462">And furthermore is supported by the Commissioner's own publicly announced position, during the tax year involved in this case, a position which he did not reversed until 1956, three years after the year in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.083" offset="667669">First ruling was issued in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.710" offset="678222">The Commissioner reversed this position in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.709" offset="694209">I should add in all fairness Mr. Justice Harlan that the earlier rulings commencing in 1951, were not formally published rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.950" offset="735169">They were issued to individual taxpayers, but they were widely circulated and published in financial and tax services and were generally known to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.305" offset="776547">And in fact, into this particular record, there is evidence that at least petitioner Gourielli relied on the ruling that he had read about.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.997" offset="823359">In both of these cases, the taxpayers purchased approximately half a million dollars worth of bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.151" offset="864005">Mr. Gourielli paid 117 and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.549" offset="881560">Mr. Goldfarb paid 110 on the average.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.842" offset="898696">In both cases, the bonds were callable at a general call price on 30 days notice at approximately 105.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.242" offset="936312">And in both cases, the bonds were also callable at a special call price out of certain sinking funds which the issuer was required to maintain and which I will deal with it in some detail later at 102.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.216" offset="1000260">The Government conceives that the taxpayers were entitled to deduct the difference between what they paid in Mr. Gourielli's case 117 and in Mr. Goldfarb's case approximately 110, and the general call price 105 in the year in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.392" offset="1072985">The Government, however, denies the further right of the taxpayer to deduct down to the special call price which in one case was 102 and the other case approximately 101.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.385" offset="2976893">And he now admits that the issue of likelihood is immaterial or at least he says he does.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.071" offset="3003643">He concedes that just as economic likelihood has no bearing on the right of the taxpayer to use the general call price so it has no bearing on the right of the taxpayer to use the special call price.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.645" offset="3069994">He does suggest rather wistful -- wistfully that maybe the right to amortize down to the general call price was the wrong rule but he also concedes that it is too late in the game to change that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.265" offset="3124433">What he now says is that the legal probabilities must be such that the issuer can call all of the bonds of the particular issue at the special call price at the special call date.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.730" offset="3194337">What he is really doing if I understand it correctly is to say that the phrase "earlier call date" in Section 125 means unconditional and unlimited earlier call date.</text>

            <text syncTime="843.713" offset="3478235">However, the issuer was also entitled to have used out of the sinking fund, the proceeds of the takings by eminent domain, the proceeds of destroyed property that was not replaced and the insurance proceeds that came in, the proceeds of released property that were released from the land of the indenture and so in accordance with permission that was granted in the indenture.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.083" offset="3587741">In other words, there were many sources of funds which might have found themselves in the sinking fund and which could have been used to redeem the bonds at the special call price.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.091" offset="3635702">In fact, the respondent in its brief, I think is a bit unfair because it makes the -- he makes the point that the chance of the taxpayers bonds in this case being redeemed in particular year were one out of a hundred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1048.198" offset="4296182">In that case, the taxpayer had bought American Telephone and Telegraph convertible bonds at 121 which were redeemable on 30 days notice in 104 and with respect to which the taxpayer had the right to convert it by the -- into stock by the payment of $40 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.853" offset="4390745">Interestingly enough to market for the stock at that point was 61, so that it was perfectly clear that the premium that was being paid for these bonds was not premium in the sense of a cost for payment for higher rate of interest which was being paid on the bond, but rather it was being paid for the convertibility feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.860" offset="4486771">And this -- the respondent came to this Court and urged that what Congress meant in the statute when it used the phrase "bond premium" was through bond premium, and this Court categorically rejected the respondent's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.877" offset="4570885">The Court held that Congress was legislating for the generality of the case and that a separate analysis of each case would lead to narrow -- to use the Court's language, "To narrow and quite possibly unfair distinction between varying bond issues without warrant in the general language employed or in the legislative history."</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.608" offset="4677778">Also, the Court said that, "If there was a loophole, the amendment must obviously be enacted by Congress and not by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or this Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.401" offset="4732949">Respondent made a great deal in that case of the fact of revenue loss which might be produced by giving the taxpayer the benefit of the bond premium, deduction, just as he has adverted to this -- in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.671" offset="4802017">And I think that the language which this Court used in the Korell case might appropriately be referred to at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.096" offset="4839737">The Court stated, "We cannot reject the clear and precise avenue of expression, actually adopted by the Congress, because in a particular case, we may know that the public revenues would be maximized by adopting another statutory approach."</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.167" offset="4928031">The interesting thing to me about the Korell case as applied to this case, is this, respondent would deny the taxpayer, the right to take the amortization down to the special call price in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.533" offset="5005458">Although there was admittedly a possibility that he might be deprived in the taxable year of his premium, admittedly perhaps an unreal possibility or an unlikely one that we said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.668" offset="5070033">But this Court permitted the taxpayer to take the premium in the Korell case, although there was absolutely no way that the issue where could have deprive the taxpayer of the premium which he paid in that case, or of the tax benefit that he achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.814" offset="5146624">Because, under the terms of the bond issue in the Korell case, if the bonds were called, the taxpayer had the right between the date of the call and the actual date of con -- con -- of redemption to convert into stock and thereby fully protect his premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.498" offset="5233351">In other words, there was absolutely no possibility in the Korell case that the premium which the taxpayer paid and which this Court said he was entitled to deduct in 120 -- under 125 could have been taken away from him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.388" offset="5536893">If there is need for interpretation, I would like to remind this Court that the legislative history bears out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.074" offset="5567718">That Congress was on notice as early as 1942, that the special call prices were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.123" offset="5619858">Respondent gives the testimony of Mr. Osgood of the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Commerce before the Senate Finance Committee in 1942, the back of his hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.862" offset="5670849">But I would remind this Court that if in 1950 in deciding the Korell case thought that Mr. Osgood was deserving of better treatment, because it cited Mr. Osgood itself as evidence of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.535" offset="5741484">Furthermore, in 1954, Congress was on notice of the special call provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.569" offset="5765622">And indeed in beginning to narrow the gap or to close the door, referred to the fact that Section 125 permitted the deduction of bond premium in the case where the call features were "nominal or inoperative."</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.177" offset="5844093">What could be more descriptive of what we are talking about here -- than of what we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.556" offset="5881605">Thus Congress did not do anything about it in 1942, did not do anything about it in 1954 when it had the chance and it was not until 1958 when Congress finally closed the door completely that the privilege which taxpayers seeks in this case was eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.862" offset="5970840">There's an interesting contrast between Congress' action and the respondent's action in terms of retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.142" offset="6011904">Congress in narrowing the gap or commencing to narrow the gap both in 1954 and 1958 very carefully made their actions prospective only to prevent in their terms unfair retroactive application to previous investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.261" offset="6112423">This is in sharp contrast to the position of the respondent, who refers to the previous rulings as being inoperative because my client or our clients did not rely on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.972" offset="6187238">Respondent misunderstands the thrust of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.466" offset="6209285">We are not saying that our taxpayers are entitled to rely on these prior rulings in and of themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.717" offset="6238229">But we do say that if the interpretation of Section 125 is necessary, there is no better evidence of what a reasonable interpretation would be then respondent's own interpretation during the tax year in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.785" offset="6310536">Finally, I would like to point out in terms of specifics that respondent is playing fast and loose on its retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.728" offset="6346271">As our brief show, as our main brief and our reply brief, there have been five other cases before the courts in which the special call price was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.187" offset="6396113">Now, it is true that in those cases respondent's main thrust was to deny the amortization deduction completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.726" offset="6426311">But the fact of the matter is that if -- as it subsequently turned out, respondent was unsuccessful in designing all amortization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.407" offset="6461001">The issue of the special call price against the general call price would have become absolutely critical and yet not once in those five cases did respondent choose to raise the issue of the special call price.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.840" offset="6738735">And if he -- once he chose one, he had to stick with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.331" offset="6756707">The Solicitor General's office has informed me just before this argument last evening that they will point out or point out in oral argument to a ruling which provides that this is not true and interprets this regulation without belaboring the point because I do not consider that it is particularly essential to our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.300" offset="6856600">Let me remind the Court that the ruling to which the Solicitor General representative will refer to is a ruling that deals not with two call prices that were simultaneously available, but to -- but a serious of call prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.656" offset="6925981">In other words the right to redeem in the first year, let's say the 109, in the second year at 108, the third year at 107.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.366" offset="6960880">So Your Honors by way of summary, I come back for the simple nubbin of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.824" offset="6990660">The respondent in the courts below decided these -- these cases on what they would have like the law to have been, not on what the statute said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.515" offset="7041442">I openly admit that my clients received the tax benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.777" offset="7062444">They converted all the ordinary income through a deduction into capital gain by holding and selling the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.770" offset="7090448">But this is what the owners of real estate do by taking depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.195" offset="7108106">This is the consequence of the capital gain structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.066" offset="7119600">And I don't believe that it's my function or the function of respondent to argue the policy of whether capital gains are good or bad as a matter policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.662" offset="7162023">Our point is that the same problems of likelihood with respect to the special call existed in a different form with respect to the general call.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.792" offset="7206536">The general call, it depended upon the like -- the economics of the interest market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.548" offset="7225553">In the special call case, it depended upon the likelihood of certain other events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.985" offset="7247287">Our point is that as the -- this Court said in the Korell case, and as we believe Congress said in the statute likelihood is immaterial, and the Congress was legislating for the generality of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.996" offset="7311339">And I see no point Your Honors as to why this Court should narrow the doctrine of the Korell case and go back from where it was in 1950 and where Congress said it should be particularly in a case where the respondent is trying to apply its rules retroactively and changing the signals in the middle of the stream.</text>

            <text syncTime="1849.457" offset="7501197">The Government does not come to this Court, this morning asking for a decision because of policy or tax avoidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.012" offset="7543411">There is a statute under which this 30-day tax benefit bonds, and that's the petitioner's word for the bonds, were sought to be used to convert a capital gain into a much more valuable ordinary income deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.273" offset="7616449">And it is that statute, Section 125 of the Code which is to be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.999" offset="7647378">We suggest that the answer to petitioner's argument, that Congress didn't do anything in 1942 and in 1954, because Congress didn't need to do anything, amortization because of a special call right, because of a right to redeem a fraction of the bonds was never permitted by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.699" offset="7754167">And it need not -- Congress need not have rewritten the statute to meet a problem which did not exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.593" offset="11037759">The case this morning is concerned with the identification of when a bond is subject to an earlier call date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.004" offset="11079346">For the statute provides that the premium will be deducted over the period to maturity or to an earlier call date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.849" offset="11126784">The question is what rights of redemption provided in the indenture with respect to a particular bond constitute a right to call that bond and thereby establish an earlier call date permitting the amortization to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.242" offset="11196374">In this case, the rights of special call were of two kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.409" offset="11225004">First, the issuers retain the right to use funds in the sinking fund to purchase bonds in 30 days notice at the special call price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.443" offset="11281115">The right to place money in the sinking fund was severely limited to 1% of the outstanding bonds, thus 1% over a year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.076" offset="11319672">Thus the right to purchase funds at the special price, was a right to purchase 1% of the outstanding issue drawn by lot each year that is the most that was afforded under that sinking fund redemption provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.534" offset="11413504">The second right was a right to use funds on deposit in three property funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.863" offset="11442866">And I would like to pass quickly over that although I will take time if it's necessary the right to put money in the three property fund was a contingent right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.309" offset="11496573">It arose only if property was taken by eminent domain, if property was released formally from the indenture or if property was destroyed by a casualty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.363" offset="11552789">This right to use funds and the property fund did not come into being until one of those contingencies occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.044" offset="11583509">Now, in this case, we believe that the right of the issuers to use these funds to purchase 1% of the bonds on 30 days notice at the special call price, 1% drawn by lot did not establish for the entire issue for all the bonds an earlier call date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.707" offset="11698239">We contend that when the statute refers to earlier call date, it means a date on which the bond is callable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.593" offset="11741706">That the right of the issuer to call 1% drawn by lot doesn't permit a man who purchases 100 bonds to amortize the premium on the 100 bonds or man who purchase of 1000 or 10,000 just because the issuer if it elects an option, and we're not talking probabilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.150" offset="11928012">This is meant rich dividens for high bracket taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.229" offset="11948283">In the example I mentioned before the recess of the $100 bond purchased at 120 and callable on 30 days at 105, the 80% tax bracket taxpayer obtains the deduction of $15 worth $12.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.484" offset="12029262">If he sells the bond at the end of the 30-day period, which he used for amortization, and he has offsetting short-term capital losses, he pays a tax of -- or what is the equivalent of $3.75, thus he has a tax profit on the 30-day purchase and sale of $8.25.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.418" offset="12125080">But of course, these transactions aren't engaged in -- in $100 amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.934" offset="12147127">At issue in this case are two different taxpayers each of whom purchased a half a million dollars of bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.192" offset="12180146">The limits of these deductions really knew no bounds, ingenuity afforded a double deduction, where taxpayers purchased bonds subject to call on 30 days notice, amortize them over the 30-day period, and then gave the bonds to charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.848" offset="12266768">Thus, again with the $100 bond purchased at 120, callable at 105, a taxpayer would borrow all but the $15 amount of the premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.709" offset="12318177">He would hold the bond 30 days and deduct the amortizable bond premium of $15.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.030" offset="12351509">Then, he would give the bond subject to indebtedness to charity and receive another deduction for his equity or for $15, so he'd get on the 30-day purchase and contribution to charity, he would get $30 of deduction worth to the 80% bracket taxpayer $24.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.951" offset="12431130">Of course, he'd also get the reward of feeling that he made the contribution to charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.332" offset="12452655">One of the cases in the courts, Evans involved the purchase of $2 million face amount of bonds at a premium of $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.452" offset="12493197">The bonds were subject to call on the 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.508" offset="12505422">The taxpayer invested $118,000 of his money, borrowed the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.123" offset="12531858">He took the amortizable bond premium deduction, gave the bonds to charity and came out with some $200,000 or a little bit over of deductions for an investment, an out of pocket investment of $118,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="3342.764" offset="13474461">Mr. Justice Harlan, I do not believe that they are unusual in the public utility industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.775" offset="13494523">These were bonds issued by Appalachian and Arkansas Power &amp; Light.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.590" offset="13513749">They have them and I seen indentures of Louisiana and several others that also had a special call provision and a general call provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.048" offset="13563591">There are many indentures and perhaps doing the financial policy book states that most bond indentures do not provide both special and the general call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.825" offset="13618657">I -- I think that it is the other way for the public utility bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.832" offset="13638719">The words of the statute to which upon the final analysis this question comes, provide that the amount of the bond premium shall be determine with reference to the basis of such bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.178" offset="13720116">And with reference to the amount payable on maturity or an earlier call date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.928" offset="13743104">They are expressed -- Congress expressed itself in the singular, not in the plural or not in the averages or not in the probabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.809" offset="13782601">We contend that the petitioners are required to establish under the law that the bond for which they claim amortization was subject to call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.400" offset="13825024">They cannot and have not met that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.239" offset="13840280">They cannot show as to any bonds on which they claim the deduction to the special call price that those bonds were subject to call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.645" offset="13885942">The statute further provides that the method of amortization must be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.659" offset="13918020">We believe that Judge Friendly for the Second Circuit put to rest once and for all the petitioners' contention that they have adopted a reasonable method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.058" offset="13955636">He said, "Taxpayers have cited no authority", and I'm quoting that, "It is sound accounting practice to provide within 30 days after acquiring a bond are reserved large enough to meet not only every risk of call that could eventuate during the amortization period but also one that could not."</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.304" offset="14044557">We believe that it is patently unreasonable to claim amortization on 100,000 or 10,000 bonds because the issuer has a right to redeem 1% of them drawn by lot each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.674" offset="14110072">The statute was passed to remedy and inequity in the prior tax law where taxpayers who purchased bonds at a premium because the bonds carried a higher interest rate than that on the market, were required to recognize the full interest as income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.094" offset="14195754">They were not able to amortize the premium against that income instead they were afforded in artificial capital loss on sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.561" offset="14241625">Of course, the 30-day amortization doesn't have any relation to interest income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.107" offset="14267852">The petitioners don't pay the higher price because of the rate of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.426" offset="14285093">They don't expect interest or at least buy them for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.732" offset="14302333">They sell them after 30 days and at most received of small amount of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.070" offset="14323649">However, the argument that this was not the purpose for which Congress enacted the statute was made in the Korell case was not successful and we don't rely on it although we do believe in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.440" offset="14377148">We believe that the 30-day amortization does not serve the purpose for which Congress enacted the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.179" offset="14400136">We believe conclusive, however, the words of the statute, the fact that Congress three times was confronted by interpretations of the law going beyond the sound accounting principles which led to its passage and three times amended the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.259" offset="14472443">In fact, after the Korell decision, Congress was so certain of its position as to the purpose of this law that its Committee within 10 days had issued a report and an amended version of the law which amendment was enacted some two months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.978" offset="14547257">The claims of these petitioners are, we believe, unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.957" offset="14579231">They made a deduction to the special call price and it was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.659" offset="14605981">The deductions afforded them were respectively $64,000 and $27,000 under their right conceded by the Government in this case to make a deduction to a date on which the bond was callable, the general call date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.477" offset="14677243">They contend that they are entitled to more respectively $18,000 and $20,000 because their bonds were subject to a right in the issuer each year to draw by lot and choose 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.166" offset="14748087">We contend that that is not a date for earlier call as to any ascertainable bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.451" offset="14777135">We contend that the deduction claimed is unwarranted under the statute and that the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>
