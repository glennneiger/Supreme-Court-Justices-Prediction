            <label>Mr. Willis F. Daniels</label>
            <text syncTime="60.968" offset="347199">At the outset of my argument this morning, I should like not that be misunderstood in the statement that I made yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.521" offset="397458">I made a statement yesterday that no one has relied upon 5 (a) as justification for this compensatory payment provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.039" offset="451480">And when I made that statement, I was referring to the five adjudications that have been handled out upon this matter starting first with the promulgation of the order by the Secretary of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.698" offset="530160">The Secretary Agriculture, which appears in page 700 (a) of this record, said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.744" offset="566314">“That in the Allentown Eastern area, the milk users pay more, slightly more that than the blend price.”</text>
            <text syncTime="129.554" offset="621589">Now the blend price is higher than the Class III price, the Class III price is the lowest price fixed, and the purpose of this case is what we called the manufacture price.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.643" offset="677909">Now, Class I-A is the highest and the compensatory payment provision is the difference between the Class III price and the Class I-A price regardless of what the particular handler might have paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.871" offset="762859">So that when the Secretary, in the promulgation of the hearing, thought that we pay more, we paid the blend price which is substantially higher than Class III and then add to that, the compensatory payment, he is not relying on uniformity as it is established in 5 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="187.676" offset="854079">Now, the independent tribunal, the hearing examiner Mr. Bay, found the same thing. Mr. Plagune an employee of the Department of Agriculture designated as Judicial Officer ignored that proposition entirely and reversed the hearing examiner who held in our favor, on an entirely different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.318" offset="960658">The District Court below, at pages 223, 224, 225 of the record, held and found as a fact that we pay more than the blend price for the milk that we purchased in the Allentown Eastern area.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.709" offset="1042160">The lower circuit or the lower court, the Third Circuit, Court of Appeals, ignored 5 (a) entirely and said you are not a handler within the meaning of Section 5 (a), but the word handler in 5 (a) means pool handler, but does not mean a non-pool handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.367" offset="1148844">We disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.377" offset="1160861">It might be surprising that we do not agree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.415" offset="1172982">If we agreed with it, of course there'd be no authority in the statute, in any section to regulate non-pool handlers because handlers and the word handler appears only, not non-pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.519" offset="1257409">The circuit court held that non-pool handler and pool handler were synonymous.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.210" offset="1280188">That just can't be.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.285" offset="1288547">If it is then we are not subject, pardon me, to any regulations whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.937" offset="1335150">We contend that Section 5 (a) which is the only pricing section so far as milk is concerned in the entire statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.560" offset="1389589">5 (a) is the only pricing section, and Section 5 (a) which is page 2 of our brief, in case of milk and its products orders issued pursuant to this section shall contain one or more the following terms and conditions and in parenthesis (except as provided in Subsection 7 of this Section no others) no others.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.687" offset="1538069">Now, the Court must recall that this Act was passed after the Schechter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.400" offset="1564923">It was thoroughly debated and it was thoroughly considered and as Mr. Justice Clark has said and it was also said in the Rock Royal case, the authority granted to Secretary is minutely set up, minutely set up, and set up particular argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.134" offset="1667950">So that we look through all the Section 5 and there is no provision authorizing the Secretary to fix prices, except Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.727" offset="1718314">That is the only Section that authorizes price fixed, but it circumscribes the authority of the Secretary because it says, “Such prices shall be uniform as to all handlers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="422.609" offset="1793860">Not uniform only as to pool handler, uniform as to all handlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.732" offset="1826252">Now I shall like dwell just a moment on this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.717" offset="1858226">Some courts previously have confused in my opinion, equal costs with equal prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.563" offset="1901589">Now, we are not contending that when the price -- when our costs of the milk are all totaled up that that should be equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.054" offset="1947564">We are saying that what we paid the producers directly or through anybody must be equal so far as minimum prices are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.038" offset="1991555">We're not interested in premiums that are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.954" offset="2011199">We are interested in what the law says, the minimum prices and such price shall be uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.961" offset="2039202">Now, if it costs us more after we had paid for the raw product then it costs another dealer, we're not contending that the cost should be equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.094" offset="2079744">Now, in the Kass case, the Second Circuit went further than we're asking this Court to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.287" offset="2108479">There, the Court held that the cost must be uniform, the cost paid the producer and when one handler bought it from another, the cost include a profit to that first handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.825" offset="2178696">Justice Learned Hand dissented in that case, because he said equal costs are not guaranteed but he did not say equal prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.983" offset="2223313">As a matter of fact, he said one method of equalizing the prices to producers is through to the compensatory payment method, but that compensatory payment method must bring about uniformity and that he feels that it could be defended only on that graph.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.096" offset="2303770">His position does not differ from what we're asking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.596" offset="2317772">The Third Circuit said if uniformity applies, it applies with more parts to the Lehigh Valley and Suncrest than it applied in the Kass case.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.502" offset="2377331">We are only asking one thing that the price established for us to pay for the raw product, be equal to any other handler, pool or non-pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.478" offset="2437308">Now, we're not saying and we're not here trying to frustrate this regulation or the statute, I said yesterday, we only want the Secretary to comply with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.979" offset="2511287">And under the cloak of complexities, the administrative agency goes a great ways, but we contend that the complexities and complication arises when you leave the basic standards established by a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.220" offset="2592266">The Secretary here fixed two prices -- fixed prices, for two types of handlers under his definition of handler under the order wherein as a handler, we filed reports as a handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.855" offset="2650781">He knows the amount of milk we get and he knows that disposition of our milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.679" offset="2670111">He audits our books and he can determine what we pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="674.731" offset="2802291">(Inaudible) I'd like to say right here then all of these tribunals, the Secretary of Agriculture, the hearing examiner, the lower court, the District Court, they all ignored the fact that the Pennsylvania Milk Control Commission fixes the prices that we pay for milk, bottled in Pennsylvania and sold in New Jersey and that is higher than in the Class I price fixed by Order 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.127" offset="2931858">Now the Class I is the fluid milk what we commonly know of as the milk in bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.533" offset="2961533">Now, I have shown it I believe that the Secretary did not establish a uniform price for the raw product.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.674" offset="3002075">It is argued by the Government, he didn't fix the price method.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.910" offset="3019003">He did fix the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.449" offset="3029138">He fixes the price for the pool handlers by a formula, not a firm price, it's a formula and that formula is made up of 10 factors, wholesale prices the relationship between Class I milk and Class II, retail sales and a number factors, that fixes the price for the pool handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.631" offset="3125896">Now, how is a non-pool handler's price paid?</text>
            <text syncTime="758.926" offset="3139062">It's fixed by determining what we pay and from those reports and from our books that they audit, they can determine that and then he adds to that this enormous sum as the difference between the Class III and then Class I price and that takes us when they audit the uniform price that he has fixed for pool handlers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.296" offset="4532537">It brings me to this position that the Secretary cannot as a matter of law find that this compensatory payment provision is consistent with or it's a general to other sections of the statute, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.959" offset="4647163">It's inconsistent and cannot be found to be consistent with (a), 5 (a) because it does not bring about uniformity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1150.036" offset="4703483">It cannot be found to be consistent with (g), because it prohibits the movement of milk from this production area of Allentown in the Phillipsburg which is less than 25 miles away, even though milk comes in the New York from 400 miles, but they didn't use the word prohibit, but the fixed sets a differential that we must pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.170" offset="4828035">This amounts to a prohibition and this Court passed on that in the Bowman versus (Inaudible) case and quoted with approval in the Dumont case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.550" offset="5181524">Being a non-pool plant, we would have been met with the fact that you do not have to be a pool plant if you don't want to and therefore electing to be non-pool plant, the territorial question is not important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.203" offset="5256234">There's great doubt that the threes eastern counties -- or New -- western counties New Jersey which belong to the Metropolitan District of Eastern Bethlehem and Allentown or they belong to the Metropolitan District of Phillipsburg whichever way, whether from Pennsylvania or New Jersey, is -- is a common commercial area and the line should have been drawn actually, somewhat west, somewhat east of those three counties because they have no commercial characteristics common to New York, and Jersey City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.418" offset="5465004">I like to impress upon the Court that here are two petitioners in this market moreover -- whatever century one of them, the other for 12 years and never has been elect and never in the record that can be found that we brought cheap milk into the territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.007" offset="7127437">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.924" offset="7143111">The basic question which is before the Court in this case is whether the compensatory payment provisions of Order 27 are authorized by Section 8c (7) (d) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as first, incidental to and not inconsistent with the other terms of the Act and second, necessary to effectuate the other provisions of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.912" offset="7251048">Now, I would wish to stress at the very outset, that every administrative and judicial tribunal which has come in to contact with this case has had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that these provisions are absolutely essential to the affective operation of the regulatory scheme in -- the Order 27 marketing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.753" offset="7370376">Now, the Secretary of Agriculture himself has made detailed findings as to the necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.685" offset="7406111">None of these findings have been challenged in this Court by the petitioners as like in support in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.091" offset="7439757">The hearing examiner, while following the Kass case on the question as to whether there was an inconsistency with the statute agreed that these were desirable and even necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.707" offset="7490226">The judicial officer, the District Court, the Court of Appeals, all have come to the same conclusion that these provisions are absolutely essential in the affective operation of the regulatory scheme in the Order 27 area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.486" offset="7561279">Now, where the difference of opinion has been, and it's been a difference largely which stems from the Kass case, has been over whether these provisions are consistent with the terms of the other terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.106" offset="7615822">In the Kass case, the majority of the Second Circuit held they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.291" offset="7632541">Learned Hand in his dissent thought that they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.753" offset="7646333">The District Judge in this case held obliged to follow the Kass decision although he indicated clearly that if the question had come to him de novo, he might well have reached the different conclusion, and the Court of Appeals of course did reach a different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.581" offset="7701713">Now, we think, if the Court pleases, that the compensatory payment provisions necessarily must be considered in the context of the particular circumstances of the milk industry which is a case in federal regulation and the manner in which the concededly valid provisions of Order 27 operate to meet the troublesome problems with which this industry is faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.175" offset="7796067">For as we shall see the requirement of compensatory payments is rooted in many of the same factors peculiar to the marketing of milk which underlie the basic regulatory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.469" offset="8041200">The problem with which the milk industry is faced, of course is the problem of surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.577" offset="8065651">And the problem of surplus stems from the fact that cows unfortunately produce substantially greater quantities of milk in the summer time than they do in the winter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.759" offset="8118418">This means, since milk is a highly perishable commodity, that in order to ensure a sufficient supply of fluid milk during the winter months, when production per cow is low, it is necessary to maintain herds which will produce considerable surplus in the summer months particularly in June which is the most flush month, when production is high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.794" offset="8250598">Now, this surplus which necessarily is there, if you are going to ensure that there is enough milk to meet fluid demands in the winter time can be disposed of only in manufacturing uses such as butter, cream, cheese, ice cream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.417" offset="8352998">When it's used for those purposes, it has a very much lower value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.723" offset="8386226">Now, in the days of the unregulated markets, the producers competed eagerly for the more profitable sales in the fluid milk market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.263" offset="8448397">And the resulting cutthroat competition seriously engendered through the very poor business practices which resulted, seriously endangered the public interest in wholesome, adequate supply milk or an adequate wholesome -- the supply of wholesome milk in the marketing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.413" offset="8540975">Now, the problem there, and the problem today is to find some way of equitably distributing the burden of this surplus, that necessarily results from ensuring sufficient supplies of fluid milk in the winter time, equitably distributing the burden of the surplus among all of the producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.668" offset="8650062">Now, as the Court knows, state regulation and the voluntary endeavors of cooperatives proved unsuccessful and Congress then entered the field first in 1935 and then through the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.081" offset="8719653">Now, insofar as this Act relates to milk, it authorizes regional marketing orders, each order to be especially adapted to the conditions of the area in which it is to be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.963" offset="8783182">Now, the basic function of these orders, and this is the function of Order 27, is to establish minimum use prices for milk and to assure the payment of uniform minimum prices to the farmers by those who were engaged in the handling of milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.023" offset="8851414">Now to this end, Section 8c (5) provides for the milk order shall contain one or more of these certain terms and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.835" offset="8882761">The first is the classification of milk in accordance with its utilization such as fluid milk, as butter, as cheese, as ice cream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.752" offset="8922363">The second, the fixing or the providing of a method for the fixing of uniform minimum prices for each of these used classifications which each handler shall pay as a uniform minimum prices, the third, the payment of uniform prices to the producers irrespective of the ultimate use which maybe made of that particular milk and fourth, the adjustment of the payments by the handlers so that the total sum paid by each handler for the milk which he purchases will not be less than the value of that milk at the used classification prices, which are established by the marketing administrator under the Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.453" offset="9093204">Now the Section goes on to state, “An order shall contain no terms and conditions other than those described bearing except as provided in subsection 7” and as I indicated at the outsets, subsection 7 authorizes the inclusion of auxiliary provisions which are incidental to the terms and conditions set fort in Section 8c (5) that was inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.996" offset="9183378">Now, Order 27 in its initial form, as the Court may recall, covered New York City and these three suburban counties, Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.302" offset="9232593">In 1957, it was extended to North New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.580" offset="9249729">Now, at the outset, the order provided for the classification pooling and pricing of the milk of all handlers who had the authority -- who have the approval of the local health authorities in the marketing area to sell milk in fluid form in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.426" offset="9325066">Now, between 1938 and 1941, this was the period of the Rock Royal case, it was only the milk of those handlers which was actually sold in the marketing area or which passed through a plant in the marketing area, you see which was regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.201" offset="9388178">All kinds of problems arose, this Court referred to some of them in the Rock Royal case, tis problem of pool price milk as against unpriced milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.324" offset="9420675">In 1941, the order was amended to require the pooling and pricing of all milk disposed off by handlers who possess health authority approval, sell milk in New York City or these three suburban counties, irrespective of whether the -- they actually were selling milk in the area or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.512" offset="9501445">They had a pool and price all of their milk, sold inside of the area or sold outside of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.677" offset="9522030">This regulatory scheme was approved by the Third Circuit in the Titusville case but proved to have a substantial disadvantage and the disadvantage basically was this, under these orders of course the -- this Order, the milk is classified of course in Class I, Class II and the Class III, that's the present form of Order 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.411" offset="9645014">The handler accounts under the Order as the statute contemplates for his uses in each class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.918" offset="9671032">The milk marketing administrator then multiplies the amount of milk which the handlers accounted for in each class by the price which has been established for that class and he gets a total use value for the milk of this handler by adding then the amount of milk of each of the three classes times the class price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.748" offset="9750340">Then he does the same thing for every other handler and he obtains then an overall total, you see, used value on the milk of those handlers whose milk is being priced and he divides that by the total amount of milk that is being priced and then he gets around the figure which is the blend price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.748" offset="9842395">Now of course in the process, there are certain additions and subtractions which are made but none of those are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.486" offset="9873324">Now, the problem was this, under the old -- under the regulatory scheme as it existed between 1941 and 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.786" offset="9910523">You might have a plant or to say, we take a hypothetical plant in Massena, New York and this plant is disposing of virtually all of its milk in ice cream form which is a low value use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.160" offset="9976038">Now, if that plant -- you see we're outside of the pool, it would have very grave difficulties in getting milk supplies because it would be competing for milk supplies with the producer -- with the handlers, you see, who were in the pool and who were paying the blend price which of course is higher since it's based on a market wide utilization than the low Class III price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.815" offset="10090663">What he could do however at that time was this, he comes down to New York City and he gets the authority of the -- he gets the approval of the health authorities to dispose of -- to sell milk in the New York marketing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.533" offset="10145520">Does he sell milk in a marketing area?</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.074" offset="10151685">Oh no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.115" offset="10155865">He goes on his business the same way as he was before, making ice cream, not contributing anything to the fluid milk needs of the area, but all of his milk is pooled and priced because he had the health authority approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.227" offset="10216260">Now, then what he could do, you see, is he pays his producers the blend price as he's required to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.933" offset="10247084">He accounts to the producer settlement fund on the low Class III utilization which he actually made of the milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.625" offset="10281880">Then he can draw out of the producer settlement fund, you see, the difference between the blend price and the low Class III price because all that he's accountable for is the Class III price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.107" offset="10331826">So the result was, that the producers in the area who actually meeting the fluid milk needs of the area were subsidized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.474" offset="10377279">You see this producer -- this handler who was not meeting the needs of the area at all and this was --</text>

            <text syncTime="4306.600" offset="17329821">Now, this is so because since 1953, if there isn't enough fluid-milk in the marketing area you see from the pool-handlers to meet the fluid-milk needs of the area, no compensatory payments are due from the non-pool handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.195" offset="17400142">So the Secretary said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.601" offset="17409755">He said that it's perfectly fair to treat this milk coming into the marketing area as surplus milk because that's what it could have been disposed of outside of the marketing area, that's what its real value was in the marketing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.854" offset="17466807">Now he said I don't, “I don't -- I don't want to and indeed I can't prohibit milk from entering the area, but I want to ensure that if the non-pool handler elects, you see, to sell the milk in the marketing area as fluid instead of its alternative of selling it outside of the marketing area as surplus that he is in advantage by that election at the expense of the pool handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.606" offset="17597837">”Now, it is at the expense of the pool handler, because the pool handler after all, he is the one who is bearing the surplus which is necessary -- necessarily goes along with the fluid-milk requirements of the area and the surplus is reflected in the blend price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.461" offset="17673174">When the non-pool handler comes into the marketing area and sells fluid milk, of necessity he displaces a fluid milk sale by a pool handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.299" offset="17712567">And equal quantity of milk has to be diverted by a pool handler from a Class I use and a Class I accountability to a Class III use and a Class III accountability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.085" offset="17759692">This reduces the blend price, and the Secretary found and it is not challenged here that if this milk is permitted to come in without this compensatory payment, the blend price is going to be reduced and there is going to be a tendency on the part of a pool handler to breakaway from the pool operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="4997.342" offset="20092740">For example, the one pool handler will pays the uniform blend price as they used, required to do pay fine that he cannot get milk at the uniform blend price because of the particular circumstances which will pertain in his area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.681" offset="20158046">So, he pays a premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.770" offset="20170480">There's no question at all then under this Order, this fully regulated pool handler must still account for the difference between the blend price and the Class I price even though the effect is that his total cost exceeds the uniform minimum price for Class I which the other handler, another handler because he isn't forced to pay premiums does not have to meet it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.266" offset="20280404">Now, there is not one single reference any where in Section 8c 5 (a) to costs or to the equalization of costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.850" offset="20322722">All in it says is that uniform minimum prices shall be paid by each handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.990" offset="20355323">Therefore, even if the petitioners here were handlers within the scope of 8c 5 (a), there is no violation of the -- of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.442" offset="20409135">Now with respect to 8c 5 (g), the Section is very careful to distinguish between milk and milk products.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.826" offset="20454693">With respect to milk, it only deals with -- it only proscribes the prohibition of the entry of milk into a marketing area from any production area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.809" offset="20502653">In the case of milk products, it proscribes a limitation upon any importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.085" offset="20531702">Now, we submit that by no prices or can this Order be read as a prohibiting, the importation of milk from anywhere into the marketing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.293" offset="20572557">As a matter of fact, under the terms of this Order, again the petitioners can become fully regulated pool handlers on an absolutely equal status with all of the other regulated pool handlers and bring their milk in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.412" offset="20628982">Even without becoming fully regulated pool handlers, they're perfectly free to bring their milk in and they have been bringing their milk in over the period of the last few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.562" offset="20669628">What Lehigh does simply is on this milk, it accounts to its producers at the -- in figuring out the blend price to its producers, it accounts for the -- at the Class III price.</text>
