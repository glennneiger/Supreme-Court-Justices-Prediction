            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Number 41 -- or Number 44, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Petitioner, versus Fredrick T. Gray, Attorney General of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.608" offset="254809">Mr. Carter.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Carter</label>
            <text syncTime="45.693" offset="287201">As we understand the issue in this case which I will attempt to set out at the outset, is whether petitioner who is engaged in a course -- a regular course of conduct of attempting to educate the public in respect to issues of racial discrimination and which encourages Negroes to assert their constitutional rights and which holds itself out as being an agency which will aid if these -- if persons come forward to assert these rights in the courts, in aiding to -- in helping provide counsel, paying counsel fees and costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.937" offset="496180">And whether the attorneys, the lawyers who are associated with petitioner in these efforts and which handle cases of this kind, whether they, both petitioners and the lawyers, can be found guilty of illegal conduct and barred from these activities under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.336" offset="585728">We contend that the State has no interest to protect, in this regard, has no power to make such activity illegal and we contend that in doing so, as the Supreme Court of Appeals has held in construing the statute which is now before the Court, that the construction of the statute violates due process and equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.039" offset="692517">The case arose in this fashion on -- in 1956, at an extra session of the General Assembly of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.788" offset="735566">The statute which is now here before the Court, and which we allege is unconstitutional, was enacted along with some five or six other statutes which petitioner charges were Anti-NAACP statutes and several statutes and laws dealing explicitly with the issue of school desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.476" offset="842250">These were passed, and this was a part of the State's massive resistance plan as they called it to desegregation in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.709" offset="883210">Petitioner, feeling that these statutes were designed to destroy it as an agent as -- in its activities in Virginia, brought suit in the federal court against five statutes, I think two of them dealt with legislative investigation committees and these we could not -- we did not feel we could attack, but the prior statute would -- they were charged with being unconstitutional in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.173" offset="1009121">In the federal court, three of the statutes were struck down and two of the statutes were considered too vague for interpretation. And as the Court knows, on appeal here, the three statutes that the Court had struck down, but that judgment was vacated and remanded on the ground that the -- both statutes at the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia should've been given an opportunity to construe the statute before the federal court acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.353" offset="1125836">We are now dealing with the -- with one of the two statutes which was not before the Court in NAACP versus Harrison which --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="263.494" offset="1158332">Just out of curiosity, Mr. Carter, what's happened to those three? Are they back before the Virginia Court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="267.780" stopTime="424.873">
            <label>Mr. Robert L. Carter</label>
            <text syncTime="267.780" offset="1175468">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.581" offset="1178708">They are now pending before the Court of the City of Richmond at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.785" offset="1219563">Two of the -- the other two statutes were not touched and these are the -- one of these is the statutes we're dealing with at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.215" offset="1257284">Petitioner brought action in the state court pursuant to the instructions of the court, attacking the validity of these two statutes, and I will now only deal with one of them, the instant statute because as you know, the second statute, Chapter 36, was struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.157" offset="1337010">So that I will talk from now on as if only one statute was involved in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.411" offset="1358012">There's no need to advert at all to Chapter 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.197" offset="1385179">The petitioner took the view that the instant statute, one, did not apply to its activities or the activities of any other counsel associated with it, and asked for a construction of the statute to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.873" offset="1455919">If the statute were construed as applying to its activities or the activities of counsel who are associated with it, petitioner took the view that the statute was unconstitutional and should be struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.002" offset="1504402">The Supreme Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the statute and held that it applied to petitioner's activities and that in fact, the record disclosed on the basis of the record that petitioner was in fact engaged in what they call the illegal fomenting and starting up of litigation and the solicitation of legal business in violation of Chapter 33 and that counsel who were -- who took cases with knowledge that they were being financed by petitioner was also guilty of malpractice and should -- will be subject to disbarment.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.662" offset="1663018">The statute itself is set out on pages 2 to 5 of the -- of our brief in chief, and the italicized sections of the statute are the new matter which had been added in the 1956 session.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.633" offset="1746923">This statute had been codified as it had been in existence sometime before.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.015" offset="1768448">Ordinary statutes like -- which I've -- they call it running and capping, but I think it's -- we can, at least I will use the term bar --</text>

            <text syncTime="426.466" offset="1810244">What's capping?</text>

            <text syncTime="428.586" offset="1818708">I think -- I have never heard of it either but I gather, from the description that what it means is that a person, an agent of an attorney is a runner to secure business for him and running and capping.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.526" offset="1878476">I don't -- other than the running, I don't understand what the rest of it means.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Carter</label>
            <text syncTime="449.676" offset="1903135">Yes, I suppose so.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.817" offset="1915674">The -- as you will note the italicized section from the beginning now at the bottom of page 3 in Section 6, the italicized sections are the new matter which was added to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.124" offset="1984846">And under this statute, it is now made a malpractice for the acceptance by an attorney of the -- of an employment, compensation of cost from any person or organization with knowledge that the organization has violated the provisions of Article 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.299" offset="2077633">And in Article 7, which is on page 4, a runner or capper is now described as not only being a person acting as an agent for an attorney but as an -- acting as an agent for any organization which employs or retains or compensates an attorney in connection with any judicial proceedings in which the organization is not a party and has no pecuniary right or liability in the solicitation or procurement of business for such attorney or for the organization in connection with any judicial proceedings within which such attorney or person is employed, retained, or compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.335" offset="2245757">Now, the facts on which the court reaches the conclusion that petitioner is engaged -- is guilty of violating this Act are roughly and briefly these, and I might add that as we pointed out in our brief, that these facts were facts that were adduced in the federal court in NAACP versus Patty which was on appeal here, and it was the record that was adduced there, plus, the fact that in the state court, additional evidence was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.868" offset="2387864">These were combined and this constituted the record before the state court, upon which the Supreme Court of Appeals made its findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.355" offset="2421823">The facts disclose that the petitioner is a nonprofit New York membership corporation and that it has several subunits in Virginia described as branches and a state unit in Virginia which is called a Virginia State Conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.198" offset="2509176">It disclosed that, as I indicated at the outset, that one of the areas in which the organization operates in Virginia is to encourage Negroes to assert their constitutional rights in courts and not only does it encourage them, but the organization itself, holds itself out as being ready, willing, and able to help persons to bring their matters before the court and to finance litigation whom it is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.899" offset="2643968">It is conceded that the petitioner does not go out for people, but in terms of the -- of its publications and writings and so forth, it does attempt to encourage Negroes when necessary to assert these rights and says that it will finance them, if someone comes forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.078" offset="2724739">And as a part of the Virginia -- the State organization, there is a group of lawyers which constitute a legal committee which in this context is called a legal staff and these group of lawyers are volunteers, but they are elected each year by the state unit as a working unit of the -- of -- they have a chairman and most of the litigation in Virginia, if not all of the litigations in Virginia in the area of civil rights, which petitioner finances are handled by these attorneys.</text>

            <text syncTime="752.760" offset="3115426">And this organization did have a -- what is called a regional counsel in the name -- in the name of Mr. Sparks-Robinson who was a resident in Virginia and who was paid and retained to handle the litigation which (Inaudible) act as counsel in cases which they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.120" offset="3200899">Now, I must confess that the two organizations have operated together and jointly, but I didn't advert to that because of the fact that the NAACP is the only organization now before the Court in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.685" offset="3271116">The way that the lawyers who operate in Virginia are -- handle litigations, one, they do not work full time; two, they're volunteers.</text>

            <text syncTime="4047.327" offset="16293679">The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia decided three things it seems to me, in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.025" offset="16324504">First, that Chapter 33 was not unconstitutional, second, that the -- it did apply to the activities of the petitioner, as shown by the evidence in the record, and three, that it did apply to the attorneys employed by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.212" offset="16437248">It also held that the activities shown in this record, not only violated Chapter 33, but also the canons of legal ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.326" offset="16493672">There are two parts of Chapter 33. First, there was the amendment of Section 54-74 Code of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.331" offset="16537767">Now, that section was first found in the Code of Virginia of 1849, I believe, and from time to time thereafter, it was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.344" offset="16585728">It deals specifically with the malpractice or unprofessional conduct of licensed attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.484" offset="16622299">The 1956 Amendment to that section stated that, in essence, that an attorney was guilty of unprofessional conduct if he accepted the case from a runner or capper or from someone who had obtained that case or gotten that case in violation of Section 54-78 of the Code of Virginia which is -- defines running and capping.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.292" offset="16785512">It appears to me that the activities of the petitioner and their attorneys, as shown in the evidence of this case, violates Section 54-74 before the amendment or after amendment, or under canons of legal ethics.</text>

            <text syncTime="6341.881" offset="25471958">Secondly, we contend that this -- in other words, this statute was passed to enable the State to maintain its program of segregation and I want to point out to the Court, if I may, that what is involved in this is that what's happening with the -- with petitioner organization is that a Negro, as a group in Virginia, and I think this is a fact, are engaged in a struggle with the State for their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6376.690" offset="25611139">What has happened with the petitioner organization is that they have come together in an effort to collectively be more potent both in terms of advocacy and also in terms of bringing these matters before the Court when they cannot get redress in any other manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6392.797" offset="25675609">Now, it seems to me that this is the specific thing which this statute is striking at and condemns and what the result of the statute seems to upholding the statute what Virginia wants is that while it may -- while the State may use all of its resources that are available to maintain the status quo into these relations that Negroes will not have the benefit or the support of an organization such as petitioner's in order to attempt to bring this matter before the Court where this validity of these kinds of acts will be looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="6433.929" offset="25840076">We also think that the issue control, which I think Mr. Justice Harlan raised, we don't think that this is really an issue in this case because, in the kinds of cases in which the petitioner supports his interest is identical with the interest of the plaintiff and there cannot be in any way that we can see, cannot be and has not been demonstrated by this record in anyway in which there can be any conflict with regard to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.592" offset="25942789">We say we don't control the litigation because the petitioner doesn't control it because it's between the lawyer who's handling it and the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="6471.355" offset="25989810">But there is an identity of interest which is not true in those areas in which the question of control has arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6479.065" offset="26020634">I might also point out to the Court, in terms of the reply brief which we have filed, that, in that case, that 54-78 has been, apparently is being applied to an attorney who is -- who for activities which he engaged in on behalf and in litigation sponsored by the NAACP, the disbarment proceedings has been brought against this particular individual and that therefore, insofar as one of the district bar committees is concerned, that this new amendment is being utilized to single out attorneys that have operated for the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="6518.720" offset="26179250">And thereby, it seems to us, to prevent the kind of litigation which had been traditionally been brought before the Court to be adjudicated, raising questions of racial discrimination and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6531.638" offset="26230972">We therefore believe, if the Court please, that the statute has been wrongly construed that, as construed, the statute is violative of the rights of petitioners and its members to due process, equal protection, to -- that it denies them effective -- a right to effectively come together as a group and advocate the elimination of segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6553.560" offset="26318639">And in fact, what it does do, we think, is to deny access to the courts to a large body of Negroes for the adjudication of their rights which if petitioner does not bring these matters to the courts, they will not be adjudicated and litigated.</text>
