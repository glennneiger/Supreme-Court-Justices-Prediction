            <label>Mr. Robert Abelow</label>
            <text syncTime="40.067" offset="263607">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.555" offset="277608">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.667" offset="302059">The judgment affirmed an order of the District Court which stayed the plaintiff's action for damages brought against the union pursuant to Section 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.024" offset="359424">The company claiming that the union had breached the no-strike clause in its collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.380" offset="388890">Now, briefly and by way of background, Drake is a wholesale bakery company in New York and has a plant in Brooklyn which employs approximately 200 members of the bakery workers union.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.989" offset="455346">New Year's Day in 1960 fell on a Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.079" offset="475721">And in order to get freshly baked products to consuming public on Monday and Tuesday, Drake scheduled production for the Saturday following New Year's Day, January 2nd and allowed the employees to take off Thursday instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.182" offset="560149">In that way, they were able to get to the consuming public of baked products that were two days old instead of four or five days old.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.701" offset="598183">The union objected to this and made it clear to management that they would come in on Thursday but they wouldn't come in on Fri -- on Saturday because that was, as they said, a violation of past practice and the employees had the right to anticipate a three-day weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.507" offset="693373">And making good their threat that the employees would not come in on Saturday, 85% of them didn't come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.171" offset="732035">The handful of employees who did respond to the company's request for work was insufficient to the get the plant started.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.593" offset="765785">We closed the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.593" offset="773726">We lost thousands of dollars worth of production and sales and a considerable amount of costumer goodwill.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.591" offset="817716">Now, for the purpose of this appeal, I don't think we need to discuss the merits of the union's claim with regard to past practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.849" offset="854810">Because I understand the decisions, though the merits of the underlying dispute are matters that will be taken up by the trial court upon a full hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.196" offset="904129">What -- what has happen here is that instead of utilizing the available contractual grievance and arbitration machinery with regard to this underlying dispute of schedule, the union instigated, encouraged, it advised its employees that they did not have to report on Saturday and in fact they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.631" offset="1005902">They made good their threat that there would be a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.395" offset="1020949">Now, Drake promptly instituted an action under 301 (a) and the union just as properly made a motion to stay the action on the ground that the issue was arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.703" offset="1066193">And the case came before Chief Judge Sylvester Ryan of the District Court in New York and the motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.716" offset="1106213">Thereupon, Drake took an appeal and a panel of -- of the judges of the Court Appeals consisting of Judges Swan, Lumbard and Moore unanimously reversed, deciding that the breach of the no-strike clause was not covered by the arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.050" offset="1183535">That the union had flaunted the grievance and arbitration machinery and hence the use -- the union's motion for a stay had been improperly granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.592" offset="1221778">Then the union moved for a rehearing en banc and that application was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.952" offset="1239228">And at the time the rehearing came on before the judges of the Second Circuit, they were six in number, Judge Swan having since retired and the decision of the six judges was right down the middle, they split evenly.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.098" offset="1319790">Judge Lumbard, Judge Moore, Judge Friendly voted to sustain the original determination of the Court of Appeals, namely, that we could go forward with our action.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.704" offset="1362213">Judges Clark, Waterman and Smith voted to reverse that determination and sustained the decision of the District Court on the authority of the Steelworkers cases and to -- and the other case was left.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Abelow</label>
            <text syncTime="338.238" offset="1456358">Well, that seemed to be a question because the six active judges then took a vote on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.770" offset="1482480">What did the evenly divided court mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="348.891" offset="1498885">And there was a vote of four-to-two on that, with judges Lumbard and Friendly still maintaining that the original Court of Appeals' decision stood but the four other judges outvoting them and so that's the way that was decided.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="365.935" offset="1567117">So we have and like, we do have a majority vote that what comes to us is the judgment of the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.055" offset="1595643">And so, we are here facing a stay of the action and thus the case reaches the -- this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.398" offset="1636916">Now simply stated, the issue that's presented for determination here is whether a breach of the no-strike clause in the Drake contract is this -- is within the scope of the arbitration clause in the Drake contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.043" offset="1699506">And there is a second issue and that is whether the union having breached the grievance and arbitration clauses by advising its employees -- its members not to work and causing what we say was a stoppage and a strike whether the union may now use these very clauses as a shield to block judicial redress for the very violation --</text>

            <text syncTime="594.405" offset="2480985">Now, thus far, the issues which we have discussed have been passed upon by the First, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Sixth and the Seventh Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.134" offset="2527901">And each one of them had held that the breach of a no-strike clause was not within the scope of an arbitration clause even where the arbitration clause was phrased in broad terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.306" offset="2580564">The Second Circuit judges who consider the question in this case split evenly.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.182" offset="2604074">And about two months ago, the Third Circuit in the Yale &amp; Towne case also split.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.171" offset="2628106">The majority holding that the claim for damages there had to be arbitrate and -- arbitrated and a suit could not be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.260" offset="2668440">Now, getting down to the Drake clauses, they appear on pages 6, 7 and 8 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.562" offset="2717654">The first paragraph under the grievance procedure is admittedly broad and provides that the parties will adjust complaints, disputes and grievances arising between them involving questions or interpretation or application of any clause automatic covered by this contract directly or indirect a very broad clause admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.444" offset="2813158">Yet, in the following paragraph, you have this sentence, still under (a), "It is agreed that in the handling of a grie -- of grievances, there shall be no interference with a conduct of the business."</text>
            <text syncTime="693.163" offset="2876061">And we say that is an exception to the broadness of the proceeding language.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.667" offset="2902079">Under subsection (b), the last sentence provides that if there is no satisfactory adjustment reached, either party shall have a right to refer the matter to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.314" offset="2956622">It doesn't say that they must, it doesn't say that arbitration is the sole and exclusive remedy and it doesn't say that we can't sue under 301 (a) or any other section.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.043" offset="3011584">The no-strike clause which appears at the top of page 8 is equally broad and that too contains a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.520" offset="3053484">The clause says that there shall be no strikes, boycotts, interruptions of work, stoppages, temporary walk -- walkouts or lockouts for any reason except one.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.973" offset="3099251">Except that if either party shall fail to abide by the decision of the arbitrator pursuant to the remaining provisions of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.209" offset="3136240">And again, we say that this very language precludes in itself the right to resort to economic force, economic action and to strike and whether it be called a strike or a stoppage or a temporary walkout, they're all precluded by the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.151" offset="3219937">So that reading the Drake contract clauses and without reference to any other broad principles of law, we say that Drake never agreed to submit if any claim for damages or a breach of a no-strike clause to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.047" offset="3303528">That the clauses read together plainly state that there is to be no interference with business while grievances are being handled, plainly state that strikes include stoppages of any kind and plainly say that the union may strike on one condition during the life of the contract and one condition only and that is if the employer fails to live up to an arbitrators' award.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.951" offset="3411153">And on the argument that we have not agreed to arbitrate, this issue, aside from all other considerations, we believe that the suit was properly brought and may not be stayed in an arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.998" offset="3495372">I'm getting briefly to Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.125" offset="3507911">The basic analysis of Section 301 is of course this Court's opinion in the Lincoln Mills case.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.348" offset="3540720">And this Court like the Senators who drafted the clause, which ultimately became Section 301, regarded the no-strike clause as the very core of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.173" offset="3592025">I know the language is familiar to the Court but there is one short paragraph that seems to sum up what I want to say about the no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.186" offset="3636120">And it's the familiar paragraph which reads, "Plainly, the agreement to arbitrate grievances, grievance disputes is the quid pro quo for an agreement not to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.075" offset="3687633">Viewed in this light, the legislation does more than confer jurisdiction in the federal courts over labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.034" offset="3719502">It expresses a federal policy that federal court should enforce these agreements on behalf of or against labor organizations and then industrial peace can best be obtained only in that way."</text>
            <text syncTime="917.762" offset="3774464">Now, those principles were again repeated and reiterated in the Steelworkers cases and particularly -- particularly in the Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation case where the Court stressed that the crucial importance of the arbitration and grievance machinery came about because it was a corollary to the union's relinquishing its right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.665" offset="3886059">And thus, on the assumption of the equally and crucially importance of the no-strike clause, the decision in Lincoln Mills made federal law applicable to 301 cases and on behalf of the union specifically permitted enforcement of the arbitration clauses contained in that collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.215" offset="3976234">Now, the Drake case, this case, as we see it, presents the other side of the coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.476" offset="4009253">We say that if the union side of the quid pro -- quid pro quo under 301 (a) requires judicial redress then the employer's side of the quid pro quo, namely, the no-strike portion of the quid pro quo -- pro quo certainly requires judicial redress also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.365" offset="4108831">Answering the question that I think I've been asked through the bench, this Court recently in the Lucas Flour case had said that a strike during the term of a contract violates the grievance and arbitration clauses in the contract even when there isn't a no-strike clause included in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.698" offset="4190124">And this basically is so because the grievance procedure envisions a method of resolving grievances which is inconsistent with the use of economic force and is incorporated in the labor agreement to prevent a force of that kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.329" offset="4644655">Grievance machinery, arbitration machinery are inserted in contracts to take care of the ordinary day-to-day problems that arrive in any -- rise in any collective bargaining relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.438" offset="4697109">And ordinarily there, the arbitration and grievance processes help to keep the industrial peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.749" offset="4730337">But in the breach of a no-strike situation, the peace has already been broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.812" offset="4750608">The grievance machinery has been bypassed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.750" offset="4762415">We've had a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.056" offset="4771610">And it seems a futile thing for an employer now to be required to sit down, to do the various steps of the grievance machinery or sit down with the union representatives and discuss with him the question of whether or not there should be damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.546" offset="4841514">And any arguments to the contrary would rest upon the assumption that the draft isn't Section 301, one of the most important sections of Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.726" offset="4882265">After laboring on this question for so many hundreds of hours, we're totally unaware of the fact that practically, every collective bargaining agreement in the country, I think that the percentage is in the very high 90, contains grievance and arbitration procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.815" offset="4958647">And if the union is correct, that Section 301 actions for a breach of a no-strike clause must be stayed pending arbitration then it would seem to me that Section 301, itself, is absolutely meaningless to affect its primary purpose that the terms of industrial strike by providing a federal judiciary remedy for a breach of the two unique and crucial provisions of any collective bargaining agreement, namely, the promise of the union not to strike and the promise of the employer to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.566" offset="5093648">Looking at Section 301, we find certain agency rules set forth under subdivision (d) and subdivision (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.008" offset="5143385">And these rules that would seem would be mainly applicable to no-strike clause situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.012" offset="5167417">And if the Congress had intended violations of the no-strike clauses to be subject to the arbitration procedure, it seems to me it would not have provided an agency rules for this type of actions or certainly they would have no pertinency before an arbitrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.684" offset="6758066">And we would prefer to avail ourselves of the federal remedy under 301 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.351" offset="6780740">I want to read one short paragraph from Judge Swan's original panel decision, which sums up the point I just made permitting the union to invoke the arbitration procedure after they have reached the no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.014" offset="6851480">Judge Swan said, "Even the absence of the specific no-strike clause, it has been held that resorting to a strike, instead of utilizing the contractual arbitration machinery, prevents the union from claiming that the strike must be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.251" offset="6924413">Where the no-strike clause is as specific as in the case at bar, it seems clear that the parties intended the grievance arbitration procedure does plan strikes as a means of resolving industrial disputes but did not intend to subject alleged breaches of the no-strike clause to arbitration when a strike was resorted to before making any attempt to utilize the grievance arbitration procedure."</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.433" offset="7041128">Now, a few moments ago, I noticed that the Solicitor General was in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.324" offset="7060668">I don't see him now but I -- he wrote on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.818" offset="7082611">And in analyzing and -- and his article appeared in the Harvard Law Review which was written after the Lincoln Mills case and his observations is set forth on page 26 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.177" offset="7144051">And there, he analyzed the Lincoln Mills case and set forth what he said where the three fundamental rules with -- which have had established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.250" offset="7188355">But his concluding paragraph is mostly interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.891" offset="7202983">These rulings establish the machinery necessary for the effective judicial enforcement of agreements to arbitrate an arbitration awards except when a union resorts to a strike upon an arbitrable grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.466" offset="7273200">Consequently, when Solicitor General Cox writing as he did put in those words in his analysis of the Lincoln Mills decision, it would seems to me that he, too, recognize the fundamental inconsistency of arbitrating a claim for damages arising out of a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.539" offset="7361494">Now, I have not discussed the merits of the underlying dispute and do not intend to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.824" offset="7390647">There seems little doubt that the dispute was one that could have been arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.496" offset="7417396">We scheduled this production 12 or 14 days before the schedule went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.355" offset="7456789">We had numerous conferences with the committee of the employees and the union representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.324" offset="7488658">We worked out a modus operandi for handling the situation at Christmas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.925" offset="8099088">That there are many shadings and gradations where there is multiple absenteeism as this case involves, that there definitely is a very tenable question, a very meritorious question which a trio tribunal must pass on as to whether or not there was a strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="2033.015" offset="8235447">Another broad statement which Mr. Abelow made about the Circuit Court cases involving cognate or related questions is that many cases have held that where there is a strike in violation of the arbitration clause, the company may sue, with the implications that irrespective of the threat of the arbitration clause, it has been so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.908" offset="8323009">Now, I've carefully going through all those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.460" offset="8333249">And there isn't one that so holds -- there is one, Cameron, Lodge 12 against Cameron Iron -- Iron Works which says so in dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.679" offset="8370134">But in that case, it's only a dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.896" offset="8378911">In every other case outside of the Second Circuit, which I'll come to in a minute, the question has always been, was there a waiver?</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.274" offset="8408482">Did the union -- and I think in several of the cases, the union admitted there was a strike?</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.199" offset="8428126">And in the more recent cases including the Sinclair, which has been argued today, the question that was decided there was only one and that is the construction of the wording there which was different from the wording in the Drake case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.558" offset="8489566">Now I don't want to address myself to the wording in the Sinclair case, that's the counsel in that case to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.564" offset="8509628">But I do say that under the wording of our arbitration clause, we do have an agreement providing that the issue involved shall be submitted in writing, the matter shall then be taken up for adjustment between the union and the plant manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.523" offset="8569501">The -- either party shall have the right to refer the matter to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.549" offset="8589563">Should any party fail upon written notice to appear before the arbitrator, the arbitrator may proceed with the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.670" offset="8618088">Now, I say take them together, those clauses constitute and have always been construed between us as a practical matter to constitute an agreement for compulsory terminal arbitration between this union and this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.278" offset="8680469">Now, as to the merits, I'm not going to try to argue before the Court who was right and who was wrong in what happened in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.766" offset="8742431">But I do think that enough of the background should be stated so that the Court can see that an arbitrator would be well within his powers if he held that, as he might, there was no strike or, as he might, that the absenteeism that occurred on January 2nd, 1960 was provoked by the mishandling by the company of its labor relations or if he held that by reason of the past practice, the employees, involved for good and sufficient reasons, believed in good faith, they had a right to stay home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.851" offset="8906794">Now, the word "strike" of course is an ugly word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.918" offset="8923094">And one thing that we should come to at once is that there's a tremendous difference and it isn't necessarily recognized very clearly in the report of decisions between a strike -- when the strike is the culmination of negotiations for a new contract and an attempt to impose new economic terms on one party and the other and what has sometimes been characterized as a strike but which is better characterized as a wildcat or a stoppage or something to that effect which occurs during the term of a stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.635" offset="9057886">Now, characteristically, and it's important to remember this, a wildcat is a response.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.866" offset="9086830">It's a response to a provocation of one sort or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.679" offset="9106056">To say that it is a response to provocation, is not necessarily to say that it is correct or justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.974" offset="9135313">But when the parties have agreed, as I say that they did here, that all complaints, disputes or grievances arising between them involving any matter covered by this contract or any act or conduct or relation between the parties hereto directly or indirectly, when the parties have agreed that that is the area that is to be decided upon by an arbitrator, what is the basis for a judicial ruling that the dispute, as to whether or not there was a strike, whether or not there was a threat to strike, which I say you will find nowhere in this record that there was a threat to strike, that whether or not conduct of the type involved here can be characterized as a strike?</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.718" offset="9358294">Let me describe the conduct for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.818" offset="9366653">Here, we have a situation where for better or for worst for 15 years we've been in collective bargaining relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.807" offset="9418585">For 15 years, they have worked on a Monday to Friday a week with the past practice as we claimed that when a -- holiday comes on a Friday, the employees are given a three-day weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.293" offset="9468531">On December 16th, two -- less than two weeks before Christmas, they notified their employees that they would be deprived of their three-day weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.828" offset="9506670">It may not seem very much in the multitude in this great affairs of the world but to the people averaging between $100 and $120 a week working for Drakes at the time it came, it was something which stirred displeasure and unrest among them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2674.159" offset="10800044">But it's also a matter for adjustment machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.045" offset="10815509">While we are grieving about it, while we can't arrive at an agreement about it before December 26th comes, neither can we get a ruling by an arbitrator before December 26th comes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.275" offset="10868485">And so, in order to minimize or mitigate or reduce the area of difficulty, we turn to the employees and say, "How many of you want to come in even though we don't think you're obliged to come in?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.955" offset="10931179">Isn't it preferable that we should do that rather than simply sit back and say we have a grievance, don't come in or on the other hand, are we obliged to say to them, "You must go in and we'll arbitrate later?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.670" offset="10990007">And if it turns out they had no right to make you go in, make you get a dollar or two more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.231" offset="11012263">Now, I say this, and I was starting to say this before, that workers are human beings, that there are emotional problems of a very serious and objective character involved in this type of change of schedule and that the workers might justifiably feel that a dollar or two more is not adequate compensation for having their right to a three-day weekend taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.523" offset="11113514">Now, this has nothing to do with the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.769" offset="11122500">Only an arbitrator can say whether or not they had the right to change that schedule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.238" offset="11304312">On examining the arbitration clause, they say the Court may conclude that it commits to arbitration any dispute, difference, disagreement or controversy of any nature or character.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.063" offset="11371604">And once it is found that our clause is broader and that our clause provides as it does that involved in the arbitration machinery should be all complaints, disputes or grievances and so on, I'm not going to repeat the wording, that once that is found, that the Court as Chief Judge Ryan correctly held, exhausted its function.</text>

            <text syncTime="2890.351" offset="11664802">It is also quite clear under this contract, as it was not in many of the mid-west cases that led to the Sinclair case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.399" offset="11696985">It is quite clear under this contract that the employer may grieve, that the employer is visualized as one who may make a claim in arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.357" offset="11744841">And I have presented in point one of my brief an analysis of the clauses providing for it, the employer made -- the arbitrator shall be designated upon the written request of either the employer or the union and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.517" offset="11797400">Now, Mr. Abelow in his brief has made much of the claim that the only solid gain by an employer in a contract such as this is the no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.857" offset="11838777">I happen to disagree with that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.085" offset="11847764">I think an employer gets a lot more from an agreement than merely a no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.903" offset="11866990">But even on his theory that it's the only thing that he's really concerned about, if that's so, what else would he want to take to arbitration but that since that is what he claims to be able to grieve about and he has reserved the right to go to arbitration?</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.789" offset="12214523">Now, a question is raised about so-called "judicial redress".</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.097" offset="12231764">It happens that arbitrable redress is not only more flexible, not only more suitable both for the needs of the parties and their situation but it also may be more draconic and more effective for the purposes of the employer, as the New York courts held in Ruppert against Egelhofer which is cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.628" offset="12309922">There are two cases in the New York Court of Appeals cited in my brief which are very interesting and which I think are very susceptible to be absorbed into federal law under the Lincoln Mills dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.524" offset="12353494">Number one is the matter of the Printing Pressmen stereo -- Newark Stereotypers which held that there's no doubt that an arbitrator can render damages for a violation of a no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.072" offset="12399679">The other is Ruppert against Egelhofer which provides the clue and gives the way for solving the type of problem that was presented by Number 13, which is still pending at this term, and one phase of the Sinclair case that we are not confronted with, namely, on -- injunctive relief where appropriate or necessary where in the hypothetical case presented by Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.934" offset="12491107">The employees wrongfully and say in writing, "This fellow is a strike and we've hit the bricks and we're out."</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.679" offset="12526111">I say that an arbitrator under Ruppert against Egelhofer has the right to adjudicate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.806" offset="12550562">The employer has a right summarily to go to court and get an order confirming that at least as the New York Court of Appeals has construed New York State's own Anti-Injunction Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.270" offset="12596433">Now, I'm not here to argue any other questions under Norris-LaGuardia or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.705" offset="12614196">But I do say this, that if the issue in this case is said to depend on whether arbitration is more effective or more adequate as a means for dealing with stoppages that Ruppert against Egelhofer and manner -- matter of Printing Pressmen show very clearly that it can be more effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="3203.816" offset="12918680">Now, many arbitration clauses are not as broad as ours.</text>

            <text syncTime="3213.963" offset="12959222">Many unions may as the union in Lucas Flour did, choose to waive arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.314" offset="12980642">I looked for the first time today at the record of Lucas Flou -- Flour, when I went upstairs to the library, and I saw there that there was no reason why the union there couldn't have moved in the Massachusetts state court or remove to the federal court for the purpose of staying that damage action so it'd be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.823" offset="13054621">But apparently, they chose otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.618" offset="13069876">When the parties choose otherwise, when both of them decide we'd had enough of arbitration, we don't want it, we want to see what a judge says about this, there's no reason why, as far as I see it, the federal court shouldn't take jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.360" offset="13124838">Perhaps, if Mr. Justice Frankfurter were here, he might feel otherwise that the court -- the court has been ousted of jurisdiction by a very broad arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.721" offset="13158275">Again, I'm not here to argue that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.122" offset="13167888">But I do say this that whatever was the situation at the time the 301 was passed, the situation now is that there are many and varying types of arbitration clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.164" offset="13228074">The question of the alleged violation of a no-strike clause may come up in many and very fact patterns and fact situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.858" offset="13270810">And I say the District Courts are not to be flooded with a case every time the employer files an affidavit saying there has been a violation of the no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.596" offset="13313755">And let me say this, here -- here's a perfect example in this very case of how the common law of the shop could've been involved in a completely different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.733" offset="13358268">On page 10 of the contract, there's another clause which is import -- is as important to the employer, it seems to me as the no-strike clause, its clause held cooperation on absenteeism, "The union agrees to cooperate with the company to eliminate excessive absenteeism particularly during a holiday week."</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.528" offset="13445517">Now, conceivably, the issue that was presented in this case where only one day was taken off, where there were no tickets, where we had no ulterior demand, mind you that's an important part of this case, we weren't striking to gain some benefit, some other change of contract relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.360" offset="13524825">We had people who stayed home before because they thought they had a right to stay home and because they thought it was an imposition to make them come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.939" offset="13555127">Now, why wasn't the union's obligation completely defined and to be measured by the cooperation on absenteeism clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.424" offset="13597027">Why shouldn't we be able to come in and try to persuade an arbitrator that what occurred during Christmas week of 1959 was really something which was involved in Clause 11 on "Cooperation on Absenteeism," and that we had and that we had proved on Christmas Day, the day after Christmas, Saturday, December 26th, by getting 80 people in done or not -- oh no, to cooperate in curbing absenteeism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.014" offset="13711444">And that what happened nevertheless was that the resentment of the employees boiled over that a few hotheads in the shop decided "No, we are not going to come in despite the business agents."</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.534" offset="13845504">Each refers to Section 301 of New York Civil Practice Act in United States Arbitration Act as actually in effect a counterclaim for some specific performance of the -- of the arbitration.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard N. Meyer</label>
            <text syncTime="3447.433" offset="13893151">That is so stated on page 29 of the record in the moving affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.408" offset="13909034">The union secretary-treasurer states, "I respectfully pray that the court treat this affidavit as a counterclaim for specific performance of an agreement to arbitrate and this as a motion for summary of judgment on such counterclaim if in the Court's opinion, such is procedurally appropriate."</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.333" offset="13984684">And that of course was because of this situation at the time this action arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.127" offset="14007881">I didn't know how much further the United States Arbitration Act would be defined in its application to these controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.534" offset="14033481">I didn't know to what extent under the appropriate federal practice, the New York State Civil Practice Act would be applied to these situations or whether 301 would be regarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.210" offset="14084263">But what's the difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.786" offset="14090533">What coat we wear or what suit we wear?</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.139" offset="14099937">We are here in one posture as a -- an entity claiming that we have bargained for our contract, that all disputes or grievances are to be resolved by arbitration and we have been deprived so far by the conduct of our adversary of what judicial redress we bargained for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.366" offset="14180812">Now, there's another thing I'd like to mention in connection with this whole context and that is the fact that we are a local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.371" offset="14216861">We're a local union with autonomy, 3500 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.494" offset="14233370">To us, the question of whether or not we have to litigate in a federal court with pleadings, motions, depositions, calendar appearance, pre-trials, four days in court as against one appearance before an arbitrator which usually disposes of these things is something very vital which we bargained for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.970" offset="14319261">I won't say anything about the union's retainer arrangement with me because it's not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.914" offset="14335039">But the Court can understand and assume that it is more costly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.387" offset="14352906">Now, a clue to what's in my adversary's mind is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.513" offset="14377462">What he wants and what he seeks to establish, and I think this is in the last sentence of both his reply brief and in the last sentence of the company's brief in the Sinclair case, what he wants is the sanction of the threat of a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.569" offset="14437648">He doesn't want the sanction of a fair adjudication in a lawsuit as to who is right or who is wrong --</text>

            <text syncTime="3641.327" offset="14668675">The interesting and ironic thing about the disposition of this case below is that it was decided by a panel which was different from the panel in Signal-Stat.</text>

            <text syncTime="3662.012" offset="14751431">I don't think either of us have considered or briefed that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.746" offset="14766373">I think all courts assume that if the scope of the contract, and I think the Yale &amp; Towne which is the most recent and I think the best written case on the subject, all courts have assumed that if when an employer has come to court with his grievance, the other side says, "You should've gone to an arbitrator with your grievance."</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.934" offset="14847143">That is enough to found federal jurisdiction on for the purposes of 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.780" offset="14874520">I might mention that one of our outstanding grievances which will be litigated after this case is over, and it's set forth in the record, is whether or not we can claim damages for them for violating the contract by going to court because that has imposed expenses on the union, which it didn't have otherwise, and as I say, we bargained for a certain method and scope of adjudicating our controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.245" offset="14980368">That's why I say in this situation and -- the Drake case is really a good rock on which this whole artificial trend should found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.843" offset="15022791">This case, we think, presents a very clear illustration that there are many, many different fact situations and there are many varieties of provocation in a strike situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.605" offset="15081827">Just take the offense of last week in the steel industry, if the president had not moved so fast and so aggressively, wouldn't it be conceivable that at many mills, people would stay off the job in resentment at having signed a contract without an increase on the implied representation that there wasn't going to be a price increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.177" offset="15168031">They returned to the bargaining table on the president's request for a non-inflationary agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.908" offset="15194990">After that happened, the day after the last contract was signed, there was a price increase or a price increase attempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.370" offset="15228844">Now, I think most lawyers know, although none have said publicly, that silence, when there is a duty to speak or when one who is silent, implies or permits to be implied from his conduct a statement which is contrary to what his silence is conveying is as guilty of a fraudulent misrepresentation as one who makes a flat misrepresentation and that might have been the situation there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.818" offset="15350680">I see my time is up, I bet the Court has my point.</text>
