            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 81, Thomson Griggs, Petitioner, versus County of Allegheny.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.449" offset="157132">Mr. Blair.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Blair</label>
            <text syncTime="14.712" offset="162252">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.240" offset="180328">This case comes before your Honorable Court on the laws of a certiorari to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and involves an eminent domain proceedings before a Board of Viewers which made an award to the petitioner for the taking of an easement over his airspace by reason of the flight of planes in and out of the Greater Pittsburgh Airport owned by the County of Allegheny.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.288" offset="296521">The award was affirmed by the Court of Common Pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.175" offset="316061">Our exceptions filed embracing simply the question of risk of liability of the County for the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.994" offset="351378">On appeal, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reversed -- reversed the lower court and then set aside the award made to the petitioner on the sole ground that the County of Allegheny did not operate the planes involved in going to and from the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.761" offset="442389">The question before of this Court seems to us then is as to whether or not, on the undisputed facts in this case, the respondent took property of the petitioner and the petitioner has been deprived of his property without due process in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.448" offset="541132">It is our contention that the petitioner under authority of the decision of this Court in United States versus Causby 328 -- or 328 U.S. at page 256 that the regular, frequent, and necessary low flights of the planes over the plaintiff’s property in order -- of petitioner's property in order to get to and from this airport constant -- which interfered with this proper use and enjoinment of property constitute a taking and that the petitioner is entitled to just compensation from the County which owns airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.868" offset="714794">The Causby case, as you may recall, involved flights of bomber planes operated by United States Government in 19 -- around 1942 at Greensboro.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.013" offset="763382">The Government there had leased the airport and the planes, the bombers and other heavy military craft flew over the property of the Causby family which operated a chicken farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.673" offset="822105">Their property was located on a guide path or approach zone leading from the airport and the planes passed over at a height as it was testified and shown in that case as low as 83 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.776" offset="890441">As a consequence of this regular constant flights the chickens, were -- some of them were killed and were affected so that the Causby family had to give up operating the chicken farm and in addition to that, by reason of the noise, the vibration, the lights, they were disturbed in their regular occupancy and became frightened and nervous.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.391" offset="996916">The Court of Claims made an award to the Causbys on a basis that there had been depreciation in the value of the property in the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.044" offset="1039548">The Government appealed to this Court on the ground that these flights were lawful flights that they were made within the navigable airspace as defined by the Civil Aeronautics Board, and therefore, were lawful privileged flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.245" offset="1104332">This Court said briefly that those flights were not privileged that the space below the safe navigable airspace of 500 feet or thousand feet heading upon the location of property was not within the navigable airspace as defined in the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1926 and also on 1930 of rather the Air Commerce Act of 1926 and of Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.257" offset="1244348">Our situation is similar to that of Causby in their public use.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.626" offset="1277889">The County of Allegheny sometime prior to 1952, determined that the existing airport facilities were not adequate for the public of Allegheny County.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.909" offset="1330970">They acquired an extensive acreage in the Western part of the County and proceeded to lay out an airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.980" offset="1367333">This was in the vicinity of the -- our petitioner's property and included in the arrangements for the airport or the plans for the airport is what they called a master plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.135" offset="1419891">Now this master plan showed the runways, the three runways and also the approach zones to those runways which must be followed by planes entering and leaving the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.636" offset="1477883">In addition, under the Federal Airport Act which was passed in 1946, the County of Allegheny made application as the sponsor to the Civil Aeronautics Authorities for the grant of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.083" offset="1555728">I should say that the master plan had to be approved by the Civil Aeronautics Authority here in Washington and it was approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.103" offset="1599822">In addition, as I say, they made application for funds under this federal aid to airports as a result of which, they didn't get extensive or quite large sums of money to aid in the building of the airport and enter into agreements with the Federal Government could -- in which included among other things agreement that they would get -- they were to adopt zoning ordinances or obtain easements in airspace where necessary in order to permit the safe operation of planes in and out of the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.132" offset="1759901">Now, the petitioner's property is located on the Northeast approach zone and that is the zone leading to the Northeast runway.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.236" offset="1816325">It's about 3200 feet from the end of the approach zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.269" offset="1836492">I might say that the approach zone as shown on these master plan extends from the airport at the end of the runway a distance of 10,000 feet Northeast from the airport on a path and glider on gradient of 42:1 which means for every foot forward it rises one foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.600" offset="1929801">Our property is situated probably about 30 feet higher than the level of the airport so that on the glide angle, the approach to and from this airport, the planes on the glide angle would be according to the testimony in the record, about 12 feet above the chimney of the petitioner's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.967" offset="2047248">After the opening, the airport was opened on June 1st, 1952 by -- pursuant to a resolution of the Board of County Commissioners other -- the Board of View found as result of its independent investigation and testimony taken before, and said as what we found in directly the page 33, since the opening of the airport in Northeast runway and its approach area has been on regular operational use for landing and taking off of commercial and other aircraft in regular flight patterns of heights near and over petitioner's residence from take off has been from 30 to 300 feet and on let down from 53 to 153 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.984" offset="2283290">The result of this operation is constant operation, a regular operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.746" offset="2306382">The Board says, the low flight of the aircraft over petitioner's property interfered with this existing use and enjoinment.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.436" offset="2345148">The interference resulted from noise, disturbances and vibrations were created by such airplanes as well as the fear for personal safety caused by the low flights in close proximity to the petitioner's residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.012" offset="2411395">The said noise of planes over petitioner's property, let down to the Northeast runway have been comparable to that of a noisy factory and on take off to a noise of the riveting machine or steam hanger, that is also found on page 33 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1843.569" offset="7477687">Assuming that the plaintiff's property has been damaged, they determined that the County was not the efficient cause of that particular injury and that determination was based upon findings that were made by the Board of Viewers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.097" offset="7555741">I'd like to read this because they are just four short sentences, they appear on page 2 of my brief because that was the basis upon which we filed exceptions to the Board of Viewers award and the matter came up before the Court of Common Pleas and our Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.185" offset="7636093">The findings are number 29, 30, 31 and 32 and they read as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.237" offset="7664306">29, there is no evidence of any control exercised over any aircraft by the County of Allegheny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.057" offset="7699623">30, all flights into and out of the Greater Pittsburgh Airport are regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Administration of the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.158" offset="7739956">31, no flights of aircraft had been shown to be in violation of any regulations of the Civil Aeronautics Administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.070" offset="8003688">They did not accept our contention with respect to 31 and 32 which has to do with immunity of lights as such but --</text>

            <text syncTime="1987.307" offset="8052590">Now I suppose if that's true and if that has anything to do with whether the County should've condemned this easement and whether or not it owes money to this petitioner for taking his property, if 29 and 30 are the answer to that, why are 29 and 30 -- why don't -- and then they say well a County didn't need to acquire anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="2030.135" offset="8223953">Now, in the drafting of our master plan which is part of the preparation for the airport, we have taken, actually taken, appropriated and paid for certain number of acres of land upon which we construct our facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.679" offset="8314128">We then show an approach zone and this must all be approved by the Federal Government, an approach zone that extends out -- that extends some 10,000 feet beyond the end of the runway and fans out from a width of 250 feet to -- or from 500 feet to 2,500 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.579" offset="8405661">And that is the approach zone that the airlines are required to operate within the regulations of the Civil Aeronautics Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.413" offset="8457070">The position of the plaintiff in this case was, and the reason that was rejected by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was that the drafting of that master plan, constituted a taking of the plaintiff's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.143" offset="8527914">Now, if it constituted a taking of the plaintiff's property merely by drafting a plan and showing an approach zone to that extent, then the County would really have taken and I use that in quotes, all of the property extending 10,000 feet beyond the end of the runway and of a width going from 500 to 2,500 feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.265" offset="10704436">I do not think that this -- that a constitutional question is raised because of a possibility that the remedy might be illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.871" offset="10758875">As a matter of fact, the remedy is not illusory and the remedy has been used in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.336" offset="10788760">There have been cases against the United States Government in tort for the flight of aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.230" offset="10824286">There have been cases -- there is the case of the City of Newark where the Court -- in the District Court of New York where the -- or New Jersey where the Court went into the question of tort claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.309" offset="10892622">The only thing that they determined in that case that there wasn't sufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.376" offset="10912893">Now, whether or not, that remedy is illusory will depend if and when the plaintiff uses that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.092" offset="10959705">Now the plaintiff has no constitutional right to a particular remedy whether it'd be eminent domain or trespass or injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.537" offset="11009546">He does have as we contend and as the Supreme Court has said, he has other available remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.490" offset="11045282">Although our Supreme Court has said is that the County of Allegheny is not liable in eminent domain proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.176" offset="11080077">This is not an act of taking by the County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.885" offset="11098885">Now, in this very case, this plaintiff now has pending in the Pennsylvania Courts an action for an injunction and the cases that are cited in our brief are called the Gardner cases are really this case but they're under another name because there were five different plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.056" offset="11191568">In the last Gardner case, the Court, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court merely stayed an injunction proceeding against the airlines and against the County to compel or tell the plaintiff to proceed in some other manner to see whether there would be a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.402" offset="11284982">And the Supreme Court at that time stated that whether or not the other remedy was in trespass or in eminent domain for a taking of an easement or an eminent domain for a taking of a fee would depend upon the particular facts that he could prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.832" offset="11378709">Now, they have tried -- they have taken one position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.500" offset="11393337">They have attempted an eminent domain proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.880" offset="11406921">In that eminent domain proceedings, the Court held that there was no control over these flights by the County, that they were not regulated by the County, that they were not flown by the County and that the master plan in designing of an agreement with the Federal Government did not constitute an Act to eminent domain under the laws of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.260" offset="11512456">Now, the Court did not deny them due process because they have indicated that there are may be other remedies that there are other remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.564" offset="11549654">In fact, there is another remedy which the Court has not even indicated in its opinion and that is in a remedy under the administrative agencies which was again in the Newark against the Eastern Airlines case, the Court said that there were remedies provided for in the Federal Aviation Act for a property who claims that his property has been damaged by reason of the pattern, flight pattern set up by the Federal Government, set up by these agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.807" offset="11690611">This is not a matter for the courts to determine what is a proper flight pattern is and because these are very technical matters that the United States has set up an agency with a provision in the act where any property owner who has a complaint may go to that agency, complain about the flight pattern, perhaps have it changed and that remedy is also subject to appeal to the Court of Appeals and to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3067.677" offset="12374079">Those are all perplexing problems that have to do with this whole question of flight but I say in this case, they do not come out at this time because we haven't reached that stage of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3851.696" offset="15510131">First, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania says according to Mr. Louik at the making of the plan, the master plan which is the basis of our statement that there is condemnation of our property or the acquisition of more property, that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.168" offset="15592051">Our case was brought strictly within the rule in the classification which you said flights over private land are not a taking unless they are so low and so frequent and that is to be direct and immediate interference with the enjoinment and use of the land and that's what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.442" offset="15657148">Not the land over the plan or that the airport or the approach zones, only that when that the use of that land is with interference with us and the actual damage and contrary to what Mr. Louik says that this is a learned narrow case, it's only there has to be the actual damage even under the Causby case before a claimant can recover and that's what we say happened here and Ackerman versus the Court of Seattle was a similar case to ours in which the Supreme Court of Washington said a liability was with the port which own the airport.</text>
