            <label>Mr. Charles H. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="22.204" offset="192240">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.383" offset="208854">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and also on applications for mandamus running separately to District Court Judges Bicks and Dimock and Cashin under circumstances, I will explain in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.102" offset="315747">The heart of this case, Your Honors, is I think summed up in a single sentence in the opinion by Judge Dimock when the matter was before him and that sentence is, ?plaintiff slightly raises a serious legal question when it states that what New York is regarding as unlawful has been ruled by the United States to be a lawful Foreign Commerce.?</text>
            <text syncTime="88.512" offset="457435">Now, there's no dispute as to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.874" offset="470915">They're all stated in -- at the end of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.677" offset="486066">The only response from the defendants was a motion to dismiss for lack of sufficiency, lack of jurisdiction and lack of a substantial federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.657" offset="546043">The complaint invokes the original jurisdiction of the District Court under Section 1337 of the Code over cases arising under acts of Congress, regulating Foreign Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.959" offset="631202">The complaint after stating the relation and -- of the plaintiff and its integration into the plan for Foreign Commerce, set forth in Sections 311 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and in Section 5301 of the Internal Revenue Code, goes on to state that the Attorney General of the State of New York had ruled that the business conducted by the plaintiff so integrated, was illegal and that the Liquor Authority of New York had in consequence informed the plaintiff that its business was illegal and had threatened it with civil injunction and with criminal prosecution under the Alcohol-Beverage Control Law of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.570" offset="893680">Now, the complaint contained in consequence, four prayers, one for injunctions, temporary and permanent, two, for a declaratory judgment, three, for a three-judge court and four, for a restraining order pending the convening of the three-judge court because of the immediate irreparable damage it was suffering in consequence of the promulgation and publicity of the Attorney General's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.758" offset="1038399">The plaintiff accompanied its complaint with motions for injunction and for a three-judge court and the restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.509" offset="1089390">Now, the motion by the defendant for a dismissal and the motion by the -- motions by the plaintiffs which I've just stated all came on before Judge Bicks whose opinion is at page 49 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.749" offset="1166399">In that opinion, he has summarized correctly the allegations of the complaint as to the nature of the plaintiff's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.282" offset="1212479">Your Honors will find them at page 49 and 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.212" offset="1232227">He stated in his opinion that the ?plaintiff complies with Section 311 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and with 5301 of the Internal Revenue Code and with all the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto,? nevertheless, Judge Bicks refused all motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.824" offset="1358660">He instead reserved jurisdiction pending rulings of a filed character by the state court in an action not then pending at all and not contemplated by the plaintiff as to the policy of the State Alcohol Beverage Control Law in this situation and he refused even a restraining order to protect the plaintiff pending the institution of an action that was not then yet -- then pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.106" offset="1515813">Notwithstanding, he refused the restraining order, notwithstanding, ?that plaintiff has not since, meaning since the promulgation of the Attorney General's opinion, been able to make purchases to meet its requirements and plaintiff faces the prospect of closing its doors with consequent substantial damage.?</text>
            <text syncTime="381.133" offset="1627930">Now, the complaint reinforced that statement by Judge Bicks with pointing to -- also to the fact that it's lease from the port authority at Idlewild Airport where its sole business is conducted, was cancellable by the port authority if -- if the plaintiff ceased doing business because the port authority had a percentage of the gross profits, and that said the complaint, the plaintiff was in consequence faced with the prospect of immediate bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.145" offset="1799920">Now, the practical effect, Your Honor, of Judge Bicks' decision so far as this plaintiff was concerned, was as the Court of Appeals later pointed out, a dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.832" offset="1854673">The plaintiff was out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.807" offset="1866585">It was denied or relieved and it was just as if the -- Judge Bicks had in times dismissed the complaint and said, ?You come back to us after you've instituted and conducted a state court proceeding to final judgment in determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.110" offset="1935862">Now, then as soon as that decision by Judge Bicks came down, the port authority went right at it, I don't mean the port authority, the liquor authority went right at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.218" offset="1992286">They communicated with the interstate bonded truckers that brought the liquor from the Class VI United States Government bonded warehouses and told them that if they continue to bring any of the wines and liquors, they would be prosecuted and their licenses would be revoked by the liquor authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.191" offset="2104090">They also served a subpoena for all our books and records to be brought before the liquor authority and in addition they renewed their threats of civil and criminal prosecution against the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.530" offset="2165530">We therefore took an appeal ? oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="517.910" offset="2175039">No, we therefore, before appealing, bringing the appeal forward, we'd already appealed as soon as Judge Bicks came down with his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.210" offset="2216208">We applied to Judge Dimock because of the absence of any three-judge court to make our application to, we applied to Judge Dimock, saying that the situation had now developed to a point where we must renew before him, all the motions we had on before Judge Bicks and we said that the reinforcement of the militancy of the liquor authority put us to the point where we were just out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.864" offset="2358836">We had to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.616" offset="2369808">Judge Bicks' opinion is at page 88 of the record and it amounts to a statement that he felt constrained out of comity to follow the said --</text>

            <text syncTime="589.438" offset="2461132">Yes sir and Judge Dimock said that he felt constrained to follow the decision of Judge Bicks.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.783" offset="2510555">We thereupon brought on our appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.765" offset="2534484">Judge Bicks -- Dimock did however, grant us a temporary restraining order pending the hearing of our appeal so that we were still in business when we were before the U.S. Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals in its opinion will be found at page 103 of the record, stated that Judge Bicks and Judge Dimock had no jurisdiction whatever to make the dispositions which they made, that they had no jurisdiction to do anything except convene a three-judge court and that interpreting as they did to Stratton case in this, decided by this Court 282, the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction and it consequently granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the appeal in toto without even thinking as this Court has in the Phillips case, the other cases cited just the other day and the Bailey decision by this Court, the orders of Bicks and -- Judge Bicks and Judge Dimock which the Court of Appeals had pronounced to be in excessive jurisdiction, without jurisdiction and therefore void.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.352" offset="2904795">Now, the opinion of the Court of Appeals wound up with this extraordinary statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.787" offset="2934471">This result leaves us in a somewhat anomalous position.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.344" offset="2964773">The results we reached are unhappy ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.708" offset="2982222">We are refusing access to our court to a party who we believe is entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.113" offset="3023809">Nevertheless, as I say, they did not even vacate the orders which they were pronouncing in their opinion to be void.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.864" offset="3066859">That opinion coming down we -- and to stay pending appeal being thereby vacated, we rushed in before Judge Cashin and we said now, ?Here is the opinion of the Court of Appeals declaring that these orders of the two proceeding district judges are void? because that's the consequence of being made without jurisdiction, we renew everything before you and his opinion will be found at Section 120 as extraordinary in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.390" offset="3224952">He said that everything that the U.S. Court of Appeals had said about the orders being without jurisdiction well, dictum and that consequently the orders that had been added according to the Court of Appeals without jurisdiction was still the law of the case and still in effect and out of comity he was obliged to go along with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.666" offset="3342085">That left us where the -- but one cause and that was to come to this Court and we got a stay from Mr. Justice Harlan pending the hearing of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.370" offset="3396838">Now, a word as to our business, the complaint describes it fully and without contradiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.784" offset="3442500">Our sole business is conducted under the constant supervision and control of the U.S. Bureau of Customs acting as part of the Treasury Department in turn acting under the plan set forth in Section 311 of the Tariff Act and Section 5301 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.501" offset="3545422">Its sole business is export of wines and liquors in the original package.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.676" offset="3582098">These bottles are all bought in the U.S. Class VI custom warehouse, government warehouses at the very starting point where they are manufactured as bottle for export from the U.S.A., that's on every bottle as it comes to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.394" offset="3684916">Now, it is brought in to us under these two federal statutes for re-warehousing, that's the word, re-warehousing on our leased premises in Idlewild.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.447" offset="3749177">By that, it's meant there is under direction of the Bureau of Customs, a huge portion of our space set forth and contained under lock and key.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.131" offset="3803930">We don't have any access to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.563" offset="3817618">These bottles so bought, go directly into that big safe, as it were, under the control of the U.S. Bureau of Customs who has the sole key to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.120" offset="3871848">The perspective passenger must be a passenger on a non-stop plane to a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.312" offset="3912600">Nothing can be done if there's going to be a stop elsewhere in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.638" offset="3933915">Now, that passenger lays down his money for such number of bottles as the foreign country will allow under reciprocal arrangements made with our government to be imported there duty free because these bottles go out from us tax free and duty free.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.635" offset="4037883">And they are largely for the use of the economy passengers who -- because of this plan, this federal plan for export and reciprocity with foreign nations so as to improve our trade abroad, enables the economy passenger to buy one, two or three bottles not more than that unless the foreign country would allow more to get in duty free there, for $3 instead of what otherwise he would have to buy somewhere else for $7.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.732" offset="4266297">The United States Customs Authority writes out the necessary export documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.070" offset="4295659">The warehouse in our premises is opened by them and with these documents the bottles are taken and delivered to the purser of the nonstop plane and those documents require that those bottles be new -- not delivered to the passenger until that plane has arrived in the foreign country and the passenger has been brought, he is now on foreign soil when the purser comes along and says, ?The label on the bottle is now fulfilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.307" offset="4436616">Export from the U.S.A. has been fully accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.869" offset="4450826">?Now, it so happens that this very Section 311 in the Gulf Oil case in 309 has been before this Court and state as being within the exclusive power of the United States not a preemptive question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.458" offset="4553226">It's not a conflict question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.703" offset="4566183">It's a -- exercise of federal jurisdiction in an area where alone the Federal Government has any jurisdiction and this Court said that the purpose was to enable the American manufacturers to compete both favorably with their foreign competitors without any substantial loss of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.259" offset="4672449">Now, at the conclusion of his opinion, Judge Bicks summarized these regulations and statutes very fairly and yet he doesn't give the force to them which the old summarization necessarily expresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.852" offset="4750817">He says, the treasury department has expressly approved these proceedings and has ruled that sale so consummated, constitute an exportation of merchandise within the meaning of Section 311 of the Tariff Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.910" offset="4835035">Now, I'm going to ask Your Honors to see how the Attorney General's opinion in this case pinpoints the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.894" offset="4886967">You'll find that opinion on page 21 of the record and it makes five concessions which higher urge are of great materiality here in pinpointing the real issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.754" offset="4958438">First and I quote verbatim, ?First, this transaction is an export within the meaning of Section 311 of the Tariff Act.?</text>

            <text syncTime="1323.628" offset="5397922">Now, the reasoning of the Attorney General is very curious and I'm about to show you that is directly opposed to the ruling of the New York State Tax Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.064" offset="5455600">He says that the Alcohol Beverage Control Law of New York contains no provision for licensing a business such of ours which is connected in this way with Foreign Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.828" offset="5522683">And in as much as there being no possibility of a license because the statute doesn't authorize license, we are necessarily illegal because a sale and he calls this a sale in the State of New York, without a license is per se illegal subject to injunction and subject to criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.944" offset="5631143">Now, I think where the Attorney General's assistant who wrote that opinion over looked the fact that the legislature do more about this than apparently the Attorney General did and did not make a provision for licensing business such of ours because the legislature realized that it was in Foreign Commerce and therefore not within the jurisdiction of the State of New York at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.481" offset="5733334">Now, the state tax department which, if this was a sale within the jurisdiction of the State of New York, would have not only the right but the duty to impose a tax, has ruled just the opposite and I quote, it says, you'll find it on page 26 of the record that from the tax jurisdiction of the State of New York on alcoholic wines and liquors there must be accepted sales in United States Customs bond which of course this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.436" offset="5889128">There must be accepted sales of wines and liquors where the merchandise is stored in Class VI warehouse under general regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.588" offset="5997693">It's a warehouse which is solely under the control and supervision of the United States Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.578" offset="6133635">Now, then that being so, I will read these exceptions again, you'll see that all three of them apply to us says the Tax Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.421" offset="6169057">One, it accepts sales in United States Customs Bonds, second, it say, it accepts sales of wines and liquors rather the merchandise is stored in Class VI warehouse under general regulations and it accepts wines and liquors when sold under such circumstances that this State, State of New York is without power to impose such a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.438" offset="6269158">Well, here is a direct conflict between two departments of the state operating simultaneously.</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.705" offset="6370200">First, our position is that plaintiff is a federally sanctioned and integrated implementation for a national purpose of a congressional regulatory plan for Foreign Commerce and trade reciprocity with a foreign government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.212" offset="6452224">And that it follows that such plan and the implementations of it enacted by and authorized by the Congress are in an area of national jurisdiction in which New York has no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.372" offset="6536861">But even if we in past decide from the -- the question that New York had no jurisdiction and assume for the sake of argument that there might be duality of jurisdiction, nevertheless, the purpose of the federal statue would be clearly preempted and therefore exclusive in that sense and that I say finally in conclusion on these statements of our positions of the District Court's act, all three of these judges, the last two simply following the trail of the first, in abstaining from all protection, denying everything until some state court adjudication of finality might be made in an action not even then existing was and I speak respectfully of the lower court, abdication of the -- its original jurisdiction conferred by Section 1937 of the Code, all the cases under acts of Congress regulating Foreign Commerce and I quote the words of the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.602" offset="6825775">And that section was enacted for the very purpose of conferring on the federal courts not only the right but the duty of vindicating the acts of Congress and the national purposes reflected therein vindicating from state conflict.</text>
