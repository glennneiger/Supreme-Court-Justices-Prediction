            <text syncTime="16.687" offset="170088">This writ of certiorari brings before you, gentlemen, a conviction in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, San Diego Division under the Selective Training and Service Act for an alleged violation of the law by failing to keep the local board informed as to an address where communication from the board would reach the petitioner here at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.139" offset="295894">The regulation involved is 32 CFR 1641.3, which appears on page 3 of my brief, the white covered brief and it merely says that a registrant should at all times keep the board advised of an address where mail would reach him.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.311" offset="364648">But an order to correctly understand what address was meant by the President in the promulgation of the regulation, it's necessary for the Court to consider Section 1641.7 which appears in my reply brief, the green-back document at page 4, just an excerpt form, which mentions that when a change is made in the address, the home address of the registrant, not a temporary or other place of abode, but the home address for the registrant notification should be given within 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.332" offset="512711">And when those two regulations are interpreted together, it shows that it does not mean any address where the registrant maybe found but what the President had in mind was the home address of the registrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.918" offset="799013">Well, as I understand the regulation, if we construe the two together, the home address is the one that is required, but if a man gave an address where he would actually be reached, that would not be, I don't think, a violation of the Act because it must be given a reasonable interpretation and not one that would work a forfeiture.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.007" offset="947388">All I want to do is to make it clear that you are not saying that the failure to give home address is a violation even if he gave an address where he can be --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hayden_c_covington" startTime="220.112" stopTime="468.555">
            <label>Mr. Hayden C. Covington</label>
            <text syncTime="220.112" offset="983855">No, that's not my contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.726" offset="990229">No, I don't make that contention Justice Whittaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.242" offset="1004335">Now, the motion for judgment of acquittal raises three points whether as far as the matter of law, the letter of June 7 giving the employer's address and the home address in San Diego and the employer's address at Modesto complied with the regulation, whether or not also that on June -- rather on February the 1st, that they alleged in the indictment, he actually was residing at Modesto at this temporary address given and mail would have reached him, the question of whether or not he actually under all the circumstances had an unlawful intent or willful intent to violate the law under all the facts and circumstances and whether the evidence shows that it -- the evidence is as consistent with innocence as it is with guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.227" offset="1212270">And, there is circumstantial evidence involved in this matter on one prong and -- we say that the motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted for that reason and then we raise the third point, which I don't think I'll have time to argue, but we'll submit on the brief and that is the error of the court in refusing to give instructions 45 and 46.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.569" offset="1309654">Now the date alleged in the indictment is February the 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.799" offset="1338598">The Court should bear in mind and I believe I submit this with respect and -- but without any authority to back me up except my own opinion about the matter in reading the law and giving it a reasonable interpretation, in the usual case for a specified data is alleged in the indictment, we know that any date proved would be adequate as long as within a reasonable date unless there is a terrific variance that prejudices the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.236" offset="1452283">But in the Selective Service Regulations, each separate day is made a separate offense and there is no continuing duty that can be relied upon unless it is specifically alleged in the indictment as was held by the Ninth Circuit in the Graves case, which is cited in the main brief, Graves against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.127" offset="1535875">And, if we take the evidence here as of February the 1st, it shows indisputably that this man was in Modesto at this employer's address, the gymnasium where he slept on a cot from -- as his temporary place of abode from February 1st to February 8th.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.821" offset="1614660">And if we limit it to February 1st, there's no doubt that under the undisputed evidence, the man is not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.538" offset="1641514">Judge Carter, the trial judge in the District Court did not confine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.260" offset="1660426">At first, he did in the ruling on the evidence to February the 1st, but as we got further along in the case, he broadened it out in his charge to include the entire month of February, and we, of course, took exception to that by virtue of special request number 75 which attempted to limit the offense to February the 1st which he refused but which we don't assign error here because we think as a matter of law, under the regulations, this indictment and the regulations can be interpreted so that it is limited to February 1st because there is no allegation of continuing duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.981" offset="1807339">In the first indictment that was returned here, this man was charged with failing to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.510" offset="1829386">He was never charged with failure to provide the local board with an address until after the third trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.569" offset="1861674">The first conviction was appealed and reversed because of refusal to give special instructions and there were two hung juries on subsequent trials, Judge Weinberger tried the case twice and Judge Picard from Detroit tried it the third time and finally, Judge Carter tried it the fourth time and got hung juries on the first two counts and resulted in one conviction under this last count of the second indictment which was returned within two months before the statute of the limitations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="468.555" stopTime="471.443">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="468.555" offset="1977553">But Judge Carter trial although was on a new indictment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hayden_c_covington" startTime="471.443" stopTime="549.040">
            <label>Mr. Hayden C. Covington</label>
            <text syncTime="471.443" offset="1989151">On a new indictment containing two counts and the -- the old indictment -- the initial indictment charging failure to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.843" offset="2022693">The first indictment was merely clear and simple that he failed to report on November the 8th, three trials on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.959" offset="2047248">After the third trial, with two hung juries, the second indictment was returned with the continuing duty on the failure to report and the jury hung up on that as well as on the first indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.819" offset="2094686">The only they could agree on was this second indictment, second count of the second indictment of failure to keep the local board advised on February the 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.905" offset="2130944">And there was no allegation of continuing duty on that second count and that's why, I think, it becomes very critical in this case to confine this to February 1st in view of the fact that under the regulations, there is a continuing duty on everyday, and in order to get continuing duty, it's necessary to allege it in the indictment and they did not allege it as to this failure to give notification of an address.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.690" offset="2218088">They confined it to February the 1st and that was our contention, but nonetheless, Judge Carter, as the case progressed and as the evidence developed, began to broaden the thing from February 1st, clear to the end of February the 28th and the Court of Appeals seemingly approved this broadening process.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.864" offset="2290813">Now, briefly, let me give you the facts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="549.040" stopTime="551.617">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="549.040" offset="2299486">Was that broadening process objected to its trial?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hayden_c_covington" startTime="551.617" stopTime="858.405">
            <label>Mr. Hayden C. Covington</label>
            <text syncTime="551.617" offset="2309831">Well, I objected to it in the evidence there when -- on page -- I forget what it is, when he made his ruling but, then -- we had a conference on the instructions, we didn't know precisely what is the position he was going to take until finally the charge was given, and we had our request in there asking it to be limited at -- or -- in number 75, asked it to be limited to the February the 1st, because there was no continuing duty alleged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.344" offset="2424769">But, nonetheless, Judge Carter proceeded to broaden it out, and the only exception we had -- have is on our refusal to give that request and instruction number 75, which we don't assign here because we think as a matter of law, it can be limited to February 1st and should be limited because there is no allegation of continuing duty as the court held itself, the court below, in the Graves case.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.626" offset="2509928">Now, if I may briefly give you the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.617" offset="2521840">When this man rested he was not one of Jehovah's Witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.974" offset="2543261">He did not put in a conscience objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.822" offset="2558621">He claimed to be classified as I-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.677" offset="2574085">He got classified I-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.094" offset="2587773">He was classified III-A on the count of his father's disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.996" offset="2603342">He got married to his first wife and in this interim, he became one of Jehovah's Witnesses, domestic difficulties arose, and calling and bickering resulted, as you see in the FBI report that was excluded from evidence, which is not material, but nonetheless, in this interim of all these various addresses appear on this cover sheet, there is one address that was his wife's address where he and his wife, first wife lived together.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.419" offset="2713057">All the other addresses were his home address, his parent's address when he was living with his parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.745" offset="2738343">Now, he was ordered to report and this becomes significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.711" offset="2758196">He was ordered to report for induction in 1954, he reported and refused to submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.775" offset="2786513">He was given notification of classification, and he took appeals from that and exhausted his remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.800" offset="2810546">Now, this is the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.572" offset="2817651">1954, he was indicted for refusal to submit in Los Angeles and some months later, the indictment was dismissed because of the decision of this Court in Gonzales against the United States about failure to give the FBI and the hearing officers' report, and other reports to the registrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.868" offset="2890794">And after that, while then the case was reprocessed within this interim, that -- this problem was in the hands of the District Attorney and out of the draft board hands, these things occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.732" offset="2938337">On June 7th, 1954, he left San Diego, his home address, with his parents and went to Modesto to take up working in a gymnasium.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.831" offset="2982745">This man was a physical coach or expert and a weightlifter and an athlete, and he also was a masseur and worked in this gymnasium at various jobs up in Modesto.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.260" offset="3044394">When he moved up there, he notified the board and this letter of June 7th which becomes very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.949" offset="3067173">And, I call your attention to the letter of June 7 on page 67 of the record and the letter in substance merely informs the board that there -- he is moving to Modesto and he gives his employer's new address 1431 10th Street, which is the gymnasium, but he repeated that he could be reached within one or two days at his San Diego address and incidentally, the clerk testified but she knew that that address on that envelope was his home address in San Diego and, they knew at all times that he could be reached there.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.206" offset="3200188">He was up there from September -- from June 7th to Feb -- 1954 of February 1955 working and sleeping on this cot in the gymnasium.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.182" offset="3240103">In this interim, he was under this indictment at Los Angeles and you have to make this 250-mile trip 12 different times from Modesto to Los Angeles for court appearances and as a consequence, he did such little work that the business went down, and employer gave up to business there of in Modesto, and that job played out so to speak, and he returned to Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.967" offset="3343235">When he left Modesto and returned to Los Angeles, he did not then notify the board because that was merely a change of a temporary address, not his home address.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.925" offset="3383045">He worked in Los Angeles for up until the 20th when he went back to San Diego to help his parents move from this old address to a new address in San Diego and their street numbers aren't there and, it may confuse you during this argument and I'd like to give you this.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.502" offset="3457337">The first address, the first home address in San Diego is located on 11th Street in San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.346" offset="3480743">The second address in San Diego is located on 30th Street in San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.496" offset="3501328">And, this temporary address up in Modesto where he was working in this gymnasium was on 10th Street in Modesto not San Diego.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.432" offset="3573112">But anyhow, following February the 8th, he went to Los Angeles and got into this tree with a man by the name of Beal where he had a numerous temporary addresses in Los Angeles but did not notify the board of this change until he went to San Diego to help his parents transfer from the 11th Street address to 30th Street and, when he got back to Los Angeles, he testified, he dropped the card in the mailbox along with a letter to a woman by the name of -- who is Bertha Leonard.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.309" offset="3692648">We brought Leonard to trial and she testified she received her letter, but the board did not explain what happened to his letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.234" offset="3736325">I mean, his card -- the government postal card notifying of the change of the home address from 10th Street in San Diego to 30th Street in San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.756" offset="3794422">Anyhow, in this interim in 1954, July 1954, November 1954 to July 1955, this draft board file was taken out of the hands of the draft board and sent to Sacramento and then to Los Angeles for the use of -- in this prosecution under the first indictment that was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.243" offset="3880312">And it was in this interim found the file was out that he was in Los Angeles, changed back to Modesto, and wrote this card, deposited it in the post office, and he had this Beal as a corroborating witness that he did deposit it along with this letter to this woman Leonard in San Diego who -- woman who testified that she received the letter but there was no evidence of what happened to the card.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.032" offset="3971532">Fact of the matter is the clerk had no independent recollection at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.049" offset="3987519">She merely said that she didn't find it in the box when the first trial came up, which was four years after the letter was mailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.512" offset="4025448">And, they made no search in the file to locate it until after the third trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.228" offset="4048332">Mind youm three trials without trying to locate that letter and after the third trial, the District Attorney made a -- make them search to three out -- 3,000 out of 14,000 files and said they couldn't find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.508" offset="4097442">When Venus went to the Board in 1956, April after the -- I mean, August following April of 1956, the FBI man came and interviewed at him at his place of employment in Santa Monica, in 1956, April, and then it's the first time that he learned about this order having been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.689" offset="4174137">Now, in this connection, we all know that one of Jehovah's Witnesses who wants to exhaust his remedies must report and refuse to submit under the Espec decision to exhaust remedies as he had done previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.992" offset="4219382">Also, he didn't appeal from the classification card showing that he did not receive either the classification card or the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.964" offset="4251251">Now what happened was, he didn't leave (Inaudible) card when he left Modesto in the post office because he had in mind notifying the board from Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.550" offset="4285524">In addition to that, everybody knew that he could be reached in care of his home address and as soon as he got change of home address, he deposited this card and that becomes a question of fact because his credibility was involved as the defendant and yet he had a corroborating witness here, Beal, as to the mailing of the card.</text>

            <text syncTime="1583.628" offset="6437909">The issue in this case is the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's verdict that in February 1955, petitioner knowingly failed to comply with his address notification responsibility under Section 1641.3 of the Selective Service Regulations and Section 12 (a) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.554" offset="6545638">As we understand petitioner's argument, the counsel's argument to the Court is in effect saying, put within the factual confines of this case, that even though petitioner left Modesto, California in February 1955 without, as the jury found, notifying his local board of a change of address or providing forwarding directions and even though petitioner's parents left this old address in San Diego, and moved to a new address without petitioner notifying the board of that fact or again providing forwarding directions, nevertheless, because at some earliest stage, he had notified -- gave the board this old address of his parents, he has satisfied the address notification requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3716.685" offset="14970128">We want to get the entire draft board file in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.080" offset="14983711">And I stated there, except for the ruling of the court, I was trying to get in this September 1956 letter where he was reviewing all the facts with the board showing that he had written his letter from Los Angeles and made these changes, and I took the exception to the ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.781" offset="15046510">And then later on, the court says on its ruling that what he did thereafter has nothing to do with the charge made as to the bottom of page 92.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.344" offset="15108786">And then -- we were then talking about the August and September letter of 1956, I was trying to get that in evidence and that ruling was limited to that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.939" offset="15155179">Now, I would like to have the Court bear in mind that this third -- when the board mailed the card and the order, the old cover sheet that had this warning flag to see the letter on the inside that would give the home address had disappeared from the cover sheet because the second and third cover sheet that was used do not have this warning notation on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.586" offset="15249742">And if it had been on the third one that was used, the clerk would have turned inside and got the letter and seen specifically that that had reference to the parents' address because she so testified that the reason she put that notation on the original cover sheet was to remind her that he could always be reached in care of his parent's current address, her testimony was to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.204" offset="15336155">Now, the San Diego address on 11th Street was current until February the 1st that was home address at which time he -- when they moved, he mailed this card from Los Angeles, and had corroborating testimony but they say that's an issue of fact because of credibility and I don't know that I can strongly debate that unless I can say that Beal's testimony supporting it plus the receipt of the woman's letter would make undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.378" offset="15440854">But be that as it may, leaving the Los Angeles card out, notifying of the change of the home address, he take the June 7th letter that gave the old home address that was good up until the 21st.</text>

            <text syncTime="3865.956" offset="15567182">Another thing, the record shows that in February, he's employer was still in Modesto and the employer would have forward it to the San Diego address to the parents.</text>
