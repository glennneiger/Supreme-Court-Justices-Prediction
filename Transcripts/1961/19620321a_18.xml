            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="11.564" offset="149608">Mr. Chief Justice, this case is here on a direct appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act from the judgment of the District Court to the Western District of Missouri dismissing in its seven counts of an indictment on the ground that Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act is so vague as to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.472" offset="249292">The provisions of Section 3 are set forth most conveniently on page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.546" offset="293595">The relevant portions are the first two lines and then the last three lines in that big paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.447" offset="325151">It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to sell or contract to sell goods at reasonably low prices for the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.350" offset="396727">The indictment which was based partly on that statute and partly on the Sherman Act charged National Dairy's one of its officers with a number of monopolistic activities in violation of the Sherman Act and of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.787" offset="466526">National Dairy is the world's largest dairy concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.715" offset="482200">It has assets of something over 555 million and gross annual sales of over a billion and a half dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.479" offset="521279">To conciliate under the Sherman Act, charged a continuing conspiracy to restrain train by fixing prices, by excluding competitors from the market and by fixing differentials on the prices for sales of various kind of milk, that is milk in containers as oppose to milk in bottles, milk in stores as imposed to home deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.920" offset="615006">Those counts aren't before us, but where a part of the indictment and part of the general background.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.333" offset="640711">The seven counts under the Robinson-Patman Act with which we are immediately concerned are exemplified by Count 2 on page 9 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.658" offset="690030">The offense charged leaving out the introductory allegations is set forth in paragraphs 22 and 23 on page 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.433" offset="729109">They alleged first in the general words of the statute that National sold milk to its distributor in the Paola-Osawatomie, Kansas market at unreasonably low prices for the purpose of destroying competition in the Paola-Osawatomie Kansas market in violation of Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.712" offset="814268">That paragraph 2 goes on and particularizes the event by setting forth the facts of which it consisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.533" offset="849481">Pursuant to an effect -- an effectuation of the offense charged from paragraph 22, National utilized the advantages it posses by reason of the fact that it operates in a great many different geographical localities.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.137" offset="903920">In order to finance and subsidise the price war against small dairies selling milk in competition with it -- its distributor in the Paola-Osawatomie, Kansas market, by intentionally selling its milk to its distributor market at prices below National's cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.496" offset="973406">The latter paragraph of course limits the general charge adjust, as bill of particulars with limited indictment and it framed in the general terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.387" offset="1012903">If the Government fails to prove sales below cost then of course at the trial, the respondent must be acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.490" offset="1041324">So that we deal here not with the bear words of the statute as applied to abstract hypothetical situations that with the application of the statute to sell at prices below the seller's own cost made for the purpose of destroying competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.995" offset="1115303">The District Court granted a motion to dismiss upon the ground that the relevant portions of Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act were so vague and indefinite that they violate the constitutional provisions relating to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.208" offset="1176221">The judge delivered no opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.794" offset="1182595">His few oral remarks simply state that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.612" offset="1197850">A contrary decision I may say was rendered by Judge Alger Fee in F &amp; A Ice Cream Company against Arden Farms, the citation appears in our brief and that I believe is the only other reported case of the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.115" offset="1263783">The essence of this case, as we said, is very simple indeed and can be put in very few words.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.304" offset="1300564">Laying the statute entirely aside for the moment, let's think of this simply as a business proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.724" offset="1330239">Suppose that this vast concern named a manager for the Kansas City area.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.950" offset="1367124">And later, the officers in reviewing prices observed that he was selling milk and other milk product at prices below the cost of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.920" offset="1411009">I suggest that the officers of the concern would have no difficulty in concluding just as a business proposition that those prices were unreasonably low and that unless the manager could point to some pretty specific market condition, or business exigency that explain this that they would say that prices were unreasonably low.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.747" offset="1506408">Now, let's suppose he replied, “Well, unreasonably low, that's an awfully vague term, that's terribly, terribly vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.404" offset="1540995">How can you tell that these prices are unreasonably low?”</text>
            <text syncTime="363.198" offset="1556146">If that was his only answer, I suggest that National would still soon be looking for another Kansas City manager and that the manager would soon be looking for another job.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.363" offset="1600867">All that this statute does, now coming to the legal question, is to judge National by the same terms that it would judge its manager in the Kansas City area or the Chicago area or anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.974" offset="1663248">To put the specific illustration in general words, we say that the critical question under this statute would be whether the seller fix the price in which he sell the good so low with the specific intention of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor that the price has no rational foundation in the seller's cost, or in market conditions, or in any other business exigencies of facing the seller of a kind of a businessman without predatory intent would consider relevant in fixing his prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.041" offset="1843493">Correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.959" offset="1847254">I'll explain the reason as I go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.788" offset="1858539">But I would say that the point of view, if I may put it in those terms, because we tackle the point of view in determining negligence is from the standpoint of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.870" offset="1890826">So the point of view here, I think, is from the standpoint of the seller, and that's one of the things that narrows the range of this term reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.926" offset="1923114">It's the seller's point of view and the seller's own cost and the standard would be that of a reasonable businessman in the position of the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.884" offset="1966895">Of course, it's also necessary to have the predatory intention is just -- not just a matter of the cost level alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.823" offset="1998660">The Government to succeed would have to prove that there was a specific intent to destroy competition or eliminate a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.890" offset="2030947">I don't want to leave out that element which I think confuses the whole statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="489.453" offset="2061145">Correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.502" offset="2081416">The -- going on in more detail, the constitutional requirement of definiteness in criminal statute, serves two familiar purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.359" offset="2124779">First, it insures that citizens will have an adequate opportunity to know what conduct is forbidden before they are charged with crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.385" offset="2160933">And second, it requires Congress or the legislature in the case of the state to resolve the questions of policy and provide the court's juries with adequate rules by which they can judge on whether one is guilty or innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.315" offset="2224671">Now, both elements are plainly met in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.830" offset="2242644">Surely, no businessman reading Section 3 could have any doubt about whether the prescription of sales at unreasonably low prices for the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor, forbidding to sell goods at prices below his own cost for the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.404" offset="2333027">Here, as in so many other statutes, the requirement of a specific evil intention eliminates any danger that one would be convicted simply because the jury or judge thought that the prices were too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.663" offset="2389974">One who has a purpose so at war without historic antitrust policy, certainly cannot claim surprise innocence if the Government later proceeds against him for violating Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.962" offset="2443264">In this respect, I suggest the case is exactly like United State against Regan where the Court held that the term reasonable compensation in making deductions from the -- from one's gross income for income tax purposes was not too vague because the statute required a proof of a specific intent to defeat or evade the payment of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.498" offset="2549321">And similarly in Hygrade Provision Company against Sherman where the language might otherwise have been too vague and uncertain, the constitutionality of the statute was saved by the fact that there was required proof of a specific intent to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.618" offset="2613896">And here we think to repeat that the requirement of proof of a specific intent to eliminate a competitor or to destroy competition.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="637.035" offset="2651512">Suppose -- suppose the statute, instead of being in its present term left out at unreasonably low prices, simply made it a crime to sell goods at a price for the purpose of destroying competition -- at any price for the purpose of destroying competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.373" offset="2724864">What I have in mind, suppose a concern comes into a market in which it hasn't been theretofore and sells it as a -- what might be called an unreasonably high price in order to make people feel that the true value, if you want this kind of goods, you got to pay a price for it and that people are now selling it at a much lower price are really as it were skimping or cheating you or otherwise giving you less -- giving you meretricious commodity, would that be alright?</text>

            <text syncTime="686.767" offset="2850461">Well, that -- I'm inclined to think that it would, but I think it's a closer case than this one because it seems to me, what was done here was that instead of simply saying that predatory pricing should be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.355" offset="2912841">The Congress put in an additional safeguard as I see it because it requires the Government -- it -- it avoids or certainly reduces if not avoids entirely, any possible confusion between fixing a price which attracts business to you and therefore away from competitor, and which might standing alone give rise to arguments about whether your purpose was to destroy competition or simply to do business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.330" offset="4520730">This is a statute which is directed at dealing within historic problem for many, many years, large concerns with sufficient assets to conduct such a campaign have found cutting prices for the purpose of eliminating competitors or teaching those who are unwilling to follow its price leadership a lesson so that they will adhere to its price leadership in -- in the future and effective way of eliminating competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.459" offset="4657194">The history of the Standard Oil and Tobacco Trust was replete with instances of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.982" offset="4679346">Now, to a considerable extent where you have a combination in restraint of trade or had monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, these problems were dealt with under -- under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.164" offset="4732008">But the Sherman Act contains no specific provision directed at -- and its specific anti-competitive prac -- practices before that degree of monopoly or restraint had been achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.522" offset="4793448">Then came the Clayton Act which is Your Honor of course, the members attempted to particularize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.414" offset="4812988">And one of the things that it was directed at was on a discriminatory price cutting for the purpose of eliminating competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.212" offset="4852172">This provision turned out to have -- to be inadequate in the eyes of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.974" offset="4875264">And in 1936, the Robinson-Patman Act attempted to tighten.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.103" offset="4895744">And again, to feel more specifically with this predatory price cutting, some of the provisions as the Court recognized in Moore against Mead's Fine Bread were drawn so as to prevent a big company like this, from using the profits that it made in interstate sales to finance local price wars, and they -- they designed to eliminate small businessmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.804" offset="5010578">Discriminate not all the instances of this kind, fall under the rubric discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.103" offset="5035760">For example, there are many markets dealt is typically one of them in which the price is so affected by local conditions that one could in fact sell at a lower price in a particular market and subsidize that as sales below cost in that market out of the profits he made and some others without it's being possible to prove discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.261" offset="5144430">Or he might produce his price on a single product, adds the low cost as it's charged here and subsidize the loss by the profits he made on the other product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.614" offset="5197824">Those practices are just as predatory, just as anti-competitive and I submit just as easily identifiable as the predatory practices involving price discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.556" offset="5257592">It's evident that this is what Congress was seeking to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.389" offset="5276923">And that the -- the knowledge of the evil that it was seeking the remedy not only helps to identify the general area in which the statute falls but I suggest that it does fix the point of view, Mr. Justice Stewart, that it does make it plain that we come at this from the standpoint of the fact -- the problems facing the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.052" offset="5371591">Certainly, we don't as in -- might have been argued in the cases under the Labor Act, look at it from the standpoint of the prices -- of the situation facing the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.838" offset="5414745">After all and accept as he may see through the eyes of others, no price from his standpoint is unreasonably low.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.361" offset="5448808">I think it is also plain that we're not interested in some average cost because the theory of the antitrust laws of which this is apart is that the effect is to encourage a firm if it -- to reduce its prices and give the consumers the best buy for their money, even if this does hurt some marginal firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.577" offset="5549641">It's one when -- one gets an artificially low price, a price which has no business justification and that price coupled with the predatory intent that the policy of the antitrust laws is violated because of the long run damage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.400" offset="8449024">They referred to it again as a rule of law in the Connally case to which incidentally our brief refers four different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.963" offset="8487267">The Solicitor General was in error in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.055" offset="8495626">We do rely in part on the Connally case as well as these other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.680" offset="8514121">And I strongly urge that upon the face of the statute and the decided cases of this Court, this statute is unconstitutional as the District Court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.523" offset="8569501">Now as the Solicitor General said, “This is the first time the statute has been before this Court in the criminal case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.194" offset="8600116">This is a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.808" offset="8610565">Mr. Wise, one of the defendants in this case, an individual defendant, was entitled to notice in the statute not for the first time in the indictment that doesn't satisfy the vagueness requirements of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.789" offset="8662497">He was entitled to notice in the statute as to what he had to do to comply with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.361" offset="8692799">That is the Due Process Clause in the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.260" offset="8708368">That is the notice requirement in the Six Amendment and as this Court has said a number of times and as the Solicitor General virtually admits here today, he must find that standard and that definition in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.955" offset="8763225">And if he gets it for the first time in the indictment, which is what the Solicitor General is arguing here today, the provisions of the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment are a sham in a delusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.209" offset="8808260">As Mr. Justice Douglas said in the Cardiff case, he is entitled to it in the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.798" offset="8838562">Now, if the Court please, I say that not only is the unreasonably low price clause, unconstitutional or indefiniteness and vagueness as this Court had said, but it cannot be saved by the intent provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.259" offset="8920377">If these were saved by the intent provision of the statute as the Solicitor General has argued, then you'll read the first requirement right out of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.823" offset="8966666">The Act provides two elements of an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.050" offset="8983594">The first element of an offense is to sell at unreasonably low prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.567" offset="9001671">Now, what standard is set up by that provision?</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.444" offset="9013164">I say there is no standard set up by that provision and so as the Court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.149" offset="9031973">Now, what does the Solicitor General argued?</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.034" offset="9043466">He argues oh well -- oh well, I'm not -- don't want to talk too much about the unreasonably low price clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.996" offset="9071365">But there is an anticompetitive intent requirement in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.625" offset="9093831">But this Court has held -- all seven justices held when the subject of intent was discussed in the -- in the Screws case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.342" offset="9128730">All seven justices are writing separate opinions in this case held that the element of definiteness required by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments cannot be supplied by intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.227" offset="9180244">If so, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter indicated in his question to the Solicitor General, all you need to say would be “Any act done, any act done by a person with the intent our purpose of hindering or lessening competition would be sufficiently valid under the Fifth and Sixth Amendment,” and no court has ever held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.945" offset="9271150">Now, what does the Government say, and I might before passing on to this next point, I want to make this observation that the Government apparently at the time this appeal was taken, thought that this case should be determined as it was in the lower court on the face of the statute and not through any limitation -- limitation in the indictment, for in the notice of appeal in this case after we want it in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.119" offset="9407822">The question stated by the Government to be presented by the appeal was whether or not the unreasonably low price provision of Section 3 was a violation of -- of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.892" offset="9462888">It was not until they filed their jurisdictional statement and briefed the subject that they tried to narrow the issue before this Court to the cost question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.549" offset="9497579">Now, let us discuss the cost question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.971" offset="9511267">The Solicitor General argues in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.211" offset="9536240">We don't have to defend this statute on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.260" offset="9552436">We don't have to defend the statute on the word that Congress chose to enact namely unreasonably low prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.323" offset="9580648">We defend the statute on a ground that at least -- at least such language means sales below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.566" offset="9609592">At least, it prohibits sales below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.437" offset="9625161">Well now, in the first place, we deny that you can equate the term unreasonably low prices with the term sales below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.285" offset="9672495">There are many, many instances as in and aside the Solicitor General stated in his oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.552" offset="9701543">There are many instances when no one could possibly say that a sale below cost could be predatory in any sense, could be unreasonable, it could be an unreasonably low price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.271" offset="9748459">Many instances as they admit in their brief such as sales of excess inventory, such as sales of merchandise is not going very well, all sorts of things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.805" offset="9798614">But there are many others of prices fixed in advance of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.358" offset="9816795">You don't know what your cost are until the transaction is completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.132" offset="9839888">Every cost and every accounting system in the land is based upon cost after the transactions have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.099" offset="9875728">There's no one who knows in advance what his cost is going to be, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.098" offset="9895790">It happens constantly with an efficient operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.371" offset="9908851">It happens constantly with efficient operations that after a sale has been made, it is then determined for the first time that the sale was below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.322" offset="9944691">Let us assume that a business organization projects a certain volume over a certain period, and upon the basis of that project -- projection, they established a certain price, would it develops during the course of the -- of the period of sale that they were wrong and how much they were going to sell or and if their volume fell way below what they anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.125" offset="10039881">Or that they were wrong in what their cost were going to be, because of efficiencies or inefficiencies that develop in the course of operation or manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.826" offset="10082722">That sale turns out to be below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.720" offset="10094216">Could anyone say that that act was an unreasonable act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.420" offset="10109053">That that price was an unreasonable price?</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.548" offset="10121592">And the only way the Solicitor General suggests to this Court that you could save that situation is by the intent clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.704" offset="10154193">And I say to this Court that you held over and over again that you can't save an Act by the intent clause where -- where it submits or -- or outlines or states any indefinite standard in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.766" offset="10310405">But they're cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.040" offset="10315525">I think you will find that in both opinions, all seven justices agreed to the statement that I have just made that a -- an unreas -- that an indefinite standard or the lack of the -- of the standard cannot be supplied by intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.417" offset="10381040">And Your Honor did distinguish a number of cases which have been cited to the contrary effect on the ground that the language used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.148" offset="10411969">There were makeweight -- it was makeweight language that the Court had held in already that there was a sufficiently definite standard and pointed out in addition that there was a predatory intent or criminal intent required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.625" offset="10465886">Why Your Honor, if -- if intent, if intent could supply a needed deficiency in an indefinite standard, the Cohen case wouldn't have been decided the way it was because that required willful intent to sell at unreasonable price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.023" offset="10535476">The Frink case would not have been decided the way it was, because it is also requiring sale at an -- with a wilful intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.576" offset="10569644">The same thing was true in the -- in the Cramp case which the Court decided only last December as -- as an invalid statute, because of a failure to define the acts forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.409" offset="10632965">And that was the case in which intent was specified, a wilful intent to violate the law, and that did not save that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.580" offset="10665671">I think that the Court -- the Supreme Court has made that very clear if the Court please and I do not think there is anything in Screws to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.962" offset="10699212">In fact, I contend as I have said that all seven justices in the two opinions to which I refer are recognized that fact as a rule of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2681.819" offset="10830660">30 different states, 30 different states have adopted sales below cost statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.700" offset="10862216">Now, assuming that the Congress desired to legislate in the sales below cost field, they could easily say sales below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.938" offset="10895130">They wouldn't have to say unreasonably low pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.755" offset="10902444">The legislative history shows they didn't mean to say sales below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.495" offset="10913311">They didn't say sales below cost, but 30 different states of legislation in that field.Now, what have they done?</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.284" offset="10940479">They have prohibited sales below cost and they have defined what cost means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.421" offset="10961063">Now, these definitions vary, I must say that greatly between the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.315" offset="10984678">But there has been a standard of definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.424" offset="10997112">They have state adjust -- just what -- just how cost should be computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.202" offset="11012159">Now, the very fact that those statutes had varied greatly as between the various state is proved, it seems to us, that there is no ascertainable standard from the word cost itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.896" offset="11066911">And that if you get by the point which I have strongly urged to the Court that you cannot equate unreasonably low prices and -- and sales below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.765" offset="11110484">If you get by that and say, “Well, we will interpret the statute as meaning sales below cost” then I say, “You've got no better standard than you have before.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.852" offset="11146742">The Solicitor says “Well, anybody knows he shouldn't -- shouldn't sell below his own cost, and certainly the statute at least means that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.701" offset="11178193">Well, the indictment says that, but Congress didn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.419" offset="11197001">The indictment or Congress either one, doesn't supply or indicate what cost means if we go to the literature and define what cost means, we find the cost being defined every which way and great disagreement on the subject according to the -- the authorities which we have cited in our brief, and this Court in the Automatic Canteen case recognized the illusory nature of the term and referred to it in connection with that case which was of course justification case under Section 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.837" offset="11358751">Now, let us assume that the -- that the term unreasonably low prices should be considered to mean sales below the defendants cost -- the defendants cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.383" offset="11428864">Let's narrow it that much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.055" offset="11435551">So, although the statute does not do so, no definition of cost does so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.995" offset="11463346">Mr. Justice Stewart asked the question, “Does cost mean the defendants cost or does it means average cost?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.770" offset="11486438">We will look to the statute in vain for an answer to that question because the statute doesn't even say cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.415" offset="11513083">The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice was called upon by the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce just in 1960, to advice with them concerning a bill pending before Congress which have been introduced by Representative Patman in an effort to define the term unreasonably low cost -- unreasonably low price which was in that bill, which would have given to the Federal Trade Commission the right to determine unreasonably low prices and a -- and the trouble damage plaintiff to sue for damages resulting from sales at unreasonably low prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.259" offset="11688417">In effect, it was a bill to send aside the decision of the Court in the Nashville Milk case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.625" offset="11721853">And in that -- in that bill which was introduced by Representative Patman in 1960, there was an attempt made to define the term unreasonably low price and among other definitions in there was selling below cost and then the -- the sales below cost was defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.091" offset="11807744">And it was defined in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.661" offset="11817984">It was defined to say, first it means, cost is defined in any state sales below cost statute which might be applicable in the State where they say it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.741" offset="11874304">Second, in the absence of such a statute, it should be defined as a sale at a price less than the cost of manufacturing, packaging and selling a commodity with the payment of such transportation cost as they're born for the producers and then they go on plus overhead and other cost of the vendor doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.745" offset="11958314">Well, the Department of Justice was called upon to comment upon this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.961" offset="11991228">And the Department said that it carries overall of the ambiguities and uncertainties of the unreasonably low price cost of Section 3.</text>

            <text syncTime="3693.071" offset="14875669">The Court helds that in that -- and I -- I think properly so, in that case, there were -- there were means of common understanding and common practice, so that the standard was ascertainable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.510" offset="14929377">That's what the Court held there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.865" offset="14934810">I say for the reasons that I have argued to the Court, the words below cost have no general meaning, are not ascertainable, a great many sales can be below cost that are in no sense unreasonable, and that makes the standard indefinite and contrary to the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.538" offset="15013491">And I say in the second place, there's nothing in this statute that prohibits sales below cost in -- in terms anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.174" offset="15040031">It's unreasonably low prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.965" offset="15047241">And that, likewise, has no meaning in the law, has no meaning in common understanding, and I distinguished Petrillo on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.345" offset="15096769">I -- I want to say in -- in conclusion, if the Court please, that we have argued a number of other points in the brief, which I shall not have time to argue in my oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.022" offset="15143476">The first one being that this indictment does not limit the charge to sales below cost, because it charges in the general words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.088" offset="15195721">We argue that and explain our position, beginning on page 6 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.123" offset="15215888">I do not have time to discuss it at this time, and we'll rely upon our brief position there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.816" offset="15242637">Although I repeat, that we do not depend entirely by any means upon that construction argument, but upon the fundamental proposition that I have -- I've tried to argue to the Court, that the term unreasonably low prices is in -- too indefinite as well as the term below cost if the indictment -- if the statute should be interpreted to be limited to below cost.</text>
