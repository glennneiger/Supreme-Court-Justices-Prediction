            <label>Mr. David B. Rothstein</label>
            <text syncTime="1.659" offset="110007">Mr. Chief Justice, now, I just want to summarize in a few minutes the -- what we feel we could show if the case were to be remanded in District Court conducted a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.171" offset="216064">We think that we show generally the facts that have been discussed earlier with respect to the existence or non-existence of any statements or reports and in addition, the receipts themselves which we concede our statements but which we contend are too remote in the circumstances of this case to be held to relate to the direct testimony of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.857" offset="326823">Now, these receipts would only show two things, most of them would only show amounts of money paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.384" offset="368933">The nine would show amounts paid and in addition, certain itemizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.053" offset="403623">Now, the amounts paid on all the receipts would be reflected and is reflected in the schedule that the Government offered to produce and which was refused by the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.795" offset="466526">Moreover, all the testimo -- all that would be shown by these receipts, as to payments received, was already in the record in the form of the direct testimony or the cross-examination testimony of the witnesses, both of whom had, as we indicated earlier, readily acknowledged that they had been paid for services and expenses and they gave the amounts that they had been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.092" offset="595780">So that the receipts, insofar as they reflect money received, could not be further used to impeach the impeaching testimony already given by the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.026" offset="663489">Now, in addition, as we've also indicated, we -- we feel that -- that we can show and that there is substantial reason to believe that the trial court upon examination of the itemizations would agree that considering the overall testimony, considering the nature of these receipts and the itemizations listed, would agree that the items do not relate sufficiently directly to the matters testified about -- by the witness on the -- on his direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.050" offset="827538">Moreover, even if in the two respects in which we have suggested in our brief, at pages, and we've discussed them at pages 33 and 34, that two or three of the itemizations in these receipts might, in a very general sense, be considered to have related to direct testimony to matters about which the witness testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.000" offset="931401">We feel that there is good ground for the argument that any error, if there was error, in that turning these itemizations over, was harmless and that there was no possible prejudice to the defendant in not having had access to these particular itemizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.864" offset="1026800">And of course, the reason, primary reason for that is that he had the narrative reports that the witness had furnished to the F.B.I. concerning these very activities.</text>

            <label>Mr. Basil R. Pollitt</label>
            <text syncTime="1041.785" offset="4270477">With brief reference to Section -- to number 11 of the indicia which we used in argument to highlight a pervading error of all the indicia, I'd simply like to say in response to the Government's argument that it's my understanding of the Stromberg case, the Herndon case and the Winters case that when First Amendment -- the First Amendment rights of the defendant maybe entrenched upon, the question is not whether or not there is evidence which supports the verdict but whether or not under the instructions, the jury could have rested its verdict on those First Amendment rights, which I think is the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.194" offset="4444139">Turning briefly to the question of Section 9 (h), the purpose and the meaning of membership in that Section, the forepart of the oath seems on it's face provide for guilt by association and that was argued before Your Honors at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.437" offset="4517073">And to violate the doctrine that guilt is personal because members, all members of the Communist Party seemed to be denominated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.445" offset="4549151">But as I read the opinion, the various opinions in Douds, if the oath is to be upheld at all, it can only be upheld because the kind of membership and the kind of affiliation involved involves a personal commitment to the political strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.158" offset="4639953">That was what we ask the Court to give and that was refused and we submit that the definition of membership and I might add the definition of affiliation, both of which fall short of that personal commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.633" offset="4713932">That -- I beg your pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.614" offset="4717798">I don't mean personal -- I mean personal and organizational commitment, organizational involvement which means that personal commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.760" offset="4754369">And if it fall short of that, it doesn't meet the standards laid down by any of the six Justices on this Court who voted to uphold the forepart of the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.954" offset="4823228">Turning now to the notes, the memoranda of which were destroyed, first of all, we'd like to clarify any doubts that maybe about -- as to our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.543" offset="4885504">This was evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.711" offset="4894177">This was produceable evidence before Jencks, produceable evidence after Jencks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.747" offset="4922389">In the argument of (Inaudible) which requested in your opinion, Mr. Justice Brennan, but the one, the Government conceded that we could, at all times, have called the F.B.I. agent who took these memoranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.982" offset="4987277">And since these memoranda were made in the regular course of business, it's his duty and his practice to make such memoranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.818" offset="5018624">We could have subpoenaed those memoranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.388" offset="5028968">So that it was evidence that the Government destroy even before Jencks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.728" offset="5050284">Of course, under Section 3500, the Government concedes that these notes could, these memoranda could have been within this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.601" offset="5101798">And once that concession is made, under the Campbell case decided last term, if those notes had existed, it would've been the duty of a trial judge to have -- to conduct a judicial inquiry into whether or not they can within the scope of Section 3500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.777" offset="5178493">So that what the Government destroyed here was evidence whether it was before or after the Jencks decision, and by the way Your Honors, we raised this position before Jencks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.083" offset="5239724">This was not afore to in this alliance -- reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.833" offset="5254666">We insisted from the word "go" in his first trial that we were entitled to un-break his memoranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.221" offset="5284237">So that what the Government has done here is destroy and the police agency is to destroy potential evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.611" offset="5317778">Our position is very simple, they have no rights or to do.</text>
