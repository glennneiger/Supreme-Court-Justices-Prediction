            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="14.779" offset="162461">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.004" offset="175417">The essential question in this case is whether a Congressional Committee in the course of pre-trying state criminal matters may force a witness to invoke the privilege of self-incrimination on pain of going to jail for contempt of Congress, if the he rests his refusal on the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.441" offset="281161">More specifically, when the petitioner was called as a witness, he was then under state indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.819" offset="314598">The Committee said it would not question him regarding the subject matter of that state indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.601" offset="341765">It then asked him questions, affirmative answers to which would have been admissible at the trial of that indictment and he refused to answer on the ground that it would aid the prosecution unless be in denial of due process of law, and he was asked whether he claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, and he said no and he was asked whether he contented the due process included the privilege against self-incrimination, and he said he didn't know the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.921" offset="459107">Now, the prosecution says here that if he had invoked the privilege against self-incrimination, he would be in the clear, but since he rested his refusal on a -- an asserted denial of due process of law, he must go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.473" offset="517308">Let me now state the facts in greater detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.698" offset="530160">When this petitioner was called as a witness, he had -- he was under indictment, returned in the State of Indiana, the first count charging a conspiracy, the second count alleging bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.602" offset="581778">The dates of the acts alleged in the indictment were 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.878" offset="606856">The indictment was returned in Marion County, Indiana in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.091" offset="631724">The Committee said specifically that they would not inquire into the subject matter of the Marion County indictment, but the Committee did inquire about matters between the date that the indictment was returned, and the date of the acts alleged in the indictment, namely, allegedly improper efforts in 1957 to head-off an indictment in Lake County.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.256" offset="744364">Now, the subject matter of the inquiry, as stated by counsel for the Committee was this, page 23 of the record, top of the page, “We are inquiring into the situation in connection with the presentation before the grand jury in Lake County, Indiana; the intervention by certain union officials into that matter, and the part that was played by Mr. Hutcheson himself,” that's this petitioner, “Mr. Sawochka, the Secretary-Treasurer of Local 142 of the Teamsters, and Mr. James Hoffa, the international president of the Teamsters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="198.286" offset="896502">There is a writ -- an issue here which I will deal with later in detail as to whether there was any relation between this inquiry and the indictment as I will indicate the prosecution now concedes such a relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.253" offset="952404">Following the background state that I have quoted, four witnesses were called and -- to testify about the Lake County activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.405" offset="988975">Three claimed the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.363" offset="1000782">One claimed the attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.946" offset="1011127">All those claims were respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.702" offset="1022203">Thereupon, the Committee called a man named Blaier, who was a codefendant with petitioner in the Marion County indictment, and when they asked him about the Lake County matters, he refused because it might aid the prosecution in the case in which I am under indictment and he was permitted to go on his way.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.394" offset="1112900">He was the second general vice president of the Carpenters Union, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.928" offset="1143097">And then they called the petitioner, who is the general president, and he was asked about the Lake County transactions, he also refused to answer, but his ground for refusing is on pages 122 or 123 of the transcript was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.628" offset="1213837">“It relates or might be claimed to relate to or aid the prosecution of the case in which I am under indictment and thus be in denial of due process of law.”</text>

            <text syncTime="299.346" offset="1300773">Now, there may also have been a difference, he was the president and the other fellow was the second vice-president.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.283" offset="1324492">Now, when he stated this quoted ground for refusal, he was asked, “Do you claim the privilege against self-incrimination?”</text>
            <text syncTime="312.134" offset="1351868">“No,” and he disclaimed that consistently and then he was asked, “Do you contend that due process includes the privilege against self-incrimination?”</text>
            <text syncTime="321.706" offset="1390216">He said, “That's a legal question, I'm not qualified to answer it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="324.893" offset="1402964">They didn't ask him further.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.105" offset="1407770">They didn't ask his counsel who was present for elucidation, but unlike Blaier who was permitted to go on his way, this petitioner was directed to answer and when on 18 separate occasions he refused to answer, he was cited for contempt and this prosecution followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.861" offset="1490840">At the close of petitioner's testimony, the Committee Chairman made this statement, pages 153 and 154 of the record, "The testimony further indicates that certain high officials of both the Teamsters and the Carpenters Unions, two of the largest unions in the country, with the help and assistance of Mr. Raddock were involved in a conspiracy to subvert justice in the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.228" offset="1612257">All the facts regarding this conspiracy undoubtedly have not been developed by the Committee.</text>

          <turn speaker="frederick_bernays_wiener" startTime="430.017" stopTime="505.640">
            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="430.017" offset="1823431">That is at page 165 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.402" offset="1849031">Petitioner was tried without a jury and the judge convicted him on the ground, the stated ground, record 174, that the only recourse he had for not answering questions put by the Committee was to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.386" offset="1916949">And the prosecution now says that if he had invoked the privilege against self-incrimination, he would in the clear, but that since he rested his refusal to answer on an asserted denial of due process of law, he's got to go to jail for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.194" offset="1980165">Now, this morning here, if the Court please, I propose to discuss three basic propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.563" offset="2005661">The first, that it is a violation of due process for a legislative Committee to pre-try a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.839" offset="2034709">The second, that it is a violation of due process to force a party to make a discovery that would expose him to penalties, and the third, that the questions now under consideration were not asked in pursuance of any legitimate legislative purpose, but before I can get to those three basic propositions, I must pause to dispose of two preliminaries.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="505.640" stopTime="509.612">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="505.640" offset="2125928">Doesn't the last question come first?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frederick_bernays_wiener" startTime="509.612" stopTime="915.417">
            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="509.612" offset="2141811">Possibly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.851" offset="2150797">It could be disposed off on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.293" offset="2176502">But before I get to either of the three, I've got to deal with two preliminaries, and the first preliminary is the relationship between the Marion County indictment alleging acts in 1956, and the Lake County transactions supposed to have taken place in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.786" offset="2254555">And the relationship is this, that as a matter of Indiana law, any improper effort to head-off or discourage or stop or quash a prosecution is admissible as evidence of consciousness of (Voice Overlap) of the substantive offense and the prosecution, in their brief here, concede that affirmative answers to the questions about the Lake County activities which they referred to succinctly, if somewhat inelegantly, as the attempt to fix, would be admissible at -- would've been admissible at the trial of the Marion County indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.176" offset="2408051">This is actually the most significant con -- concession because the record shows that petitioner's counsel tried diligently and persistently to demonstrate to the Committee the relationship between these questions they were asking and the pending indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.845" offset="2474715">The Committee seems to have been completely hypnotized by the chronology.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.714" offset="2490180">These were questions about matters occurring in 1957, the last acts alleged in the indictment were in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.418" offset="2517034">How could there be any relationship, but under the Indiana rule, there is a relationship and the parties agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.705" offset="2550157">Now the second preliminary point is that penalties and disadvantages would have accrued to this petitioner if as the prosecution now says he might have done, if he had invoked the privilege against self-incrimination in turn -- in terms, and that would have been involved three demonstrable disadvantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.001" offset="2647333">Disadvantage number one; in the expressed view of the Committee Chairman on this record, and in the subsequent Committee report which has been incorporated by reference into this record, it would be perfectly -- it's perfectly plain that any invocation by a witness of the privilege against self-incrimination was treated as tantamount to an admission of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.170" offset="2752031">Now I'm familiar with the cases here that say otherwise, but this was according to that branch of the Government, they had their own views.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.889" offset="2778885">If anybody invoked the privilege against self-incrimination before them, that proved his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.719" offset="2806262">Second disadvantage, if petitioner had invoked his privilege against self-incrimination, there would have been a problem concerning his continued tenure of his union office in view of the AFL-CIO Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.808" offset="2886614">Now the precise terms of that Code are not in evidence and not part of the record, but petitioner admitted in response to questions by a member of the Committee that he was concerned about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.881" offset="2938859">And the third disadvantage that petitioner would have incurred if he had invoked his privilege against self-incrimination is this, that if at the impending Indiana trial, he had taken the stand as a witness, any prior claim of privilege on his part regarding the same subject matter could have been made the subject of prosecution comment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.028" offset="3039483">That's perfectly plain as the matter of Indiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.617" offset="3053798">Now the prosecution says Indiana couldn't constitutionally do that, and they cite the Slochower case, in the 350 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.190" offset="3092146">I don't think the Slochower case says anything to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.377" offset="3108864">After all, the cases of Twining against New Jersey and Adamson against California are still law.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.840" offset="3134777">They were reaffirmed only last term in Cohen against Hurley.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.556" offset="3149615">And they say that where a defendant in a criminal case doesn't take the stand at all, the prosecution can comment on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.266" offset="3188485">That is not so in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.271" offset="3196426">If an Indiana criminal defendant does not testify, that fact cannot be commented on.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.940" offset="3219101">But if an Indiana defendant does testify, then the prosecution may use the fact that on some previous occasion he has claimed his privilege with respect to the questions being asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.276" offset="3272495">So that at the very least, if he had -- if petitioner had before the present Committee claimed -- done what the prosecution says he should have done in order to be in the clear in respect of contempt of Congress, he would have hurt himself at the Indiana trial if he had taken the stand, and at the very least, he would have circumscribed his freedom of action at that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.682" offset="3374059">And now, with these two preliminaries out of the way, I come to the first proposition that it is a violation of due process of law for a legislative committee to pre-try criminal cases, and the first issue between the parties here is was there any pretrial in fact?</text>
            <text syncTime="837.671" offset="3454098">And we say the Committee was all too obviously pre-trying a potential criminal case in its entirety, namely, the alleged obstruction of justice in Lake County, Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.827" offset="3510732">Now that pros -- that pretrial started with an accusation, namely the background statement by the Committee counsel which I have already quoted and then that pretrial ended with a verdict by the Committee Chairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.566" offset="3581680">The testimony further indicates that certain high officials evoked the Teamsters and the Carpenters Union, with the help and the assistance of Mr. Raddock, were involved in the conspiracy to subvert justice in the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.081" offset="3639672">And then finally, there was a formal judgment of conviction entered by that verdict in the Committee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.432" offset="3669138">In one of its findings, its -- I'm reading from page 26 of petitioner's brief, one of the Committee's findings was from the evidence the Committee also finds that Maxwell C. Raddock was used by Hutcheson as a fixer in an attempt to head-off the indictment of Hutcheson, the Carpenters Vice President, O. William Blaier and the Treasurer, Frank Chapman.</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.872" offset="6526830">And that is that it is a violation of due process to force a witness before a congressional committee to subject himself to penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.001" offset="6567372">Now here in this case, simply by calling this petitioner as a witness, he was placed in a quadruple dilemma with penalties absolutely unavoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.574" offset="6613661">If he answered the questions affirmatively, they could've been used against him at his pending trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.197" offset="6636126">If he answered them negatively and those negative answers were false, he would have been subject to a prosecution for perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.146" offset="6663920">If he claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, he was subject to the three disadvantages that I've outlined, and since he refused to answer on the grounds of due process of law, he faces the six months term in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.134" offset="6715956">I ask, is it consistent with due process of law to place a person in such a dilemma simply by calling him as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.219" offset="6752214">Now of course, if the Court please, I'm perfectly aware that under the rule of United States against Murdock in the 284 United States, a witness before a federal tribunal cannot claim -- the state cannot claim danger of state self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.823" offset="6826715">The Committee here, however, recognized the unfairness of that rule and they said that they wouldn't inquire as to the subject matter of the pending indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.972" offset="6875303">At page 78 of the record, this is -- the Chairman said, first whole paragraph, “If he feels that it might jeopardize his defense, we recognized that where he is under indictment, he should not be compelled to be a witness against himself on the subject matter involved in the indictment, that rule or policy be observed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.655" offset="6957955">Well, with that, a good deal of the Murdock rule went out the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.528" offset="6977494">The difficulty before the Committee was that the Committee wouldn't recognize or couldn't recognize, it was unable to recognize the connection between these Lake County questions and the Marion County indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.982" offset="7031306">Here, the prosecution recognizes that connection and says he would have been alright if he had invoked the privilege against self-incrimination in respect to the Lake County questions and with that statement, if the Court please, a good deal more of the Murdock rule goes out the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.831" offset="7110719">Now, moreover, since the Committee here sought to insist – or to sought to assist, to encourage and indeed to exhort state law enforcement officials to pursue the subject matter of the questions namely this alleged improper procedure in Lake County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.356" offset="7196818">We have a palpable instance of the improper use of federal processes to compel disclosure for state purposes, but if that isn't enough then we urge that this situation be treated just as the great Chief Justice treated a precisely similar situation in the Saline Bank case in the first appeal and Chief Justice Marshall there said the rule clearly is that a party is not bound to make any discovery which would expose him to penalties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.220" offset="7564204">It is sufficient to say that the prosecution was under a state law which imposed the penalty, and that the federal court was simply administering the state law and no question arose as to a prosecution in another jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.026" offset="7623450">Now when I say palpably misstated, I'm not relying on dialect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.438" offset="7969102">At any rate, it is significant that here, the prosecution does not challenge our reading of the Saline Bank case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2731.437" offset="11029086">In other words, the only purpose was to get them up there and discredit him by either making him admit wrongdoing or else claim the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.113" offset="11067852">We say it's about time that the Courts put a stop to this saturnalia of exposure for exposures sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.808" offset="11098572">This legislative pretrial of criminal cases, this bringing down of penalties and disadvantages on witnesses' heads, penalties and disadvantages that follow automatically, inescapably, inevitably simply from calling them as witnesses, and this forcing of a witness to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination when in the minds of the Committee, in the minds possibly of his employers, in the minds of a great segment of the public, would involve a stigma, when they don't need his answers, when they only want him to -- ask him the questions so he will plead the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.196" offset="11272129">I submit that this kind of treatment of witnesses, not to get information out of them, but to make them invoke a stigma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.414" offset="11305044">And it is a stigma whether rightly or wrongly, this sort of business does not further any legitimate legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.807" offset="11346631">I submit it offends against public decency, and therefore defense against the Due Process Clause, and therefore the questions work as petitioner rightly said in denial of due process of law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2830.763" offset="11426461">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.262" offset="11444433">Our view of this case with respect both to the facts and the questions presented is quite different from that of petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.959" offset="11479228">Indeed, I think it is fair to say that the eventual outcome probably depends more than anything else on whether our appraisal is what occurred or the petitioner's appraisal of what occurred is the more accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.985" offset="11543280">As we see it, what occurred can be fairly summarized in four points; first, the McClellan Committee did not inquire into the real estate transactions and alleged bribery which formed the basis of the Marion County indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.967" offset="11615274">Indeed, it asked no questions which barred directly upon any issue raised by the indictment or the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.401" offset="11649024">Second, the McClellan Committee did press an investigation into and did require the petitioner to answer questions concerning the alleged use of labor union funds for the purpose of obstructing justice in Lake County, Indiana after the highway transaction had been closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.637" offset="11721958">If these expenditures were made, these expenditures of union funds, then of course they violated petitioner's fiduciary duties to the union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.775" offset="11762500">Both the investigation and the questions put to petitioner were undeniably pertinent therefore to the authorized legislative purposes of the McClellan Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.780" offset="11806490">And their purpose -- their pertinence was clearly explained to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.126" offset="11827911">Third, the authorized investigation for legislative purposes might have shown that petitioner was engaged in what I have called a -- an effort to fix the investigation in the Lake County, an investigation into the highway transaction, and therefore those questions might incidentally have produced evidence which could be used -- which would show that petitioner had a consciousness of guilt with respect to the underlying Marion County transaction, and which therefore we agree (Inaudible) if answers had been given, have been used against him in the trial of the Marion County indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.965" offset="11987257">Fourth, when the pertinent questions with this collateral impact where asked petitioner unequivocally, repeatedly, explicitly and with the advice of counsel, disavowed any reliance on the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.420" offset="12065102">There's no resemblance, I think between the situation with respect to Mr. Blaier and the situation with respect to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.207" offset="12104182">Blaier said that the he refused to answer on the ground that the questions relates to or might be claimed to relate to or aid the prosecution in the case in which I am under indictment and stopped there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.714" offset="12162278">Petitioner, both before and after saying that, said I do not rely on the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.771" offset="12194461">Blaier never said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.386" offset="12200939">Blaier indeed was understood by the press and I take it by the Committee as the record shows to have been invoking the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.865" offset="12238869">So of course, the circumstances in this respect are quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.893" offset="12266977">Those, as I see it, are the essential path in the collateral relation between the authorized investigation into the Lake County alleged obstruction of justice, and the underlying highway scandal.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="3056.096" offset="12327790">Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask whether this petitioner in any portion of the statement before the Committee did say to the Committee that his reason was the same as that given by Mr. Blaier?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="3073.008" stopTime="3152.629">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3073.008" offset="12395395">I -- his counsel at the time petitioner was questioned, which followed the questioning of Blaier, did say that he wanted to correct the misapprehension which the press had gained, he didn't say the Committee had gained, but which the press had gained, and that Blaier was not invoking the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.912" offset="12494973">By that time, of course, Blaier had been excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.435" offset="12513155">He's off the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.499" offset="12517334">When I say excused, I -- to be honest I don't recall whether he'd been released from under subpoena or not, but he was off the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.416" offset="12545024">The questioning of him was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.237" offset="12552338">Now I suppose that it could've been inferred from then, that the petitioner was seeking to make the same kind of claim that Blaier and his counsel subjectively thought that Blaier had been making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.926" offset="12611062">But there is still is the fact that petitioner said something that Blaier never said to the Committee, whatever his subjective thoughts have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.958" offset="12643244">Petitioner said, “I waived the privilege, not in those words, but I disavow it, I don't rely on it” and Blaier never said any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.324" offset="12672711">So naturally what petitioner did say carried an entirely different meaning, I think, it certainly could have carried a different meaning to the members of the McClellan Committee in what Blaier said.</text>

            <text syncTime="3180.804" offset="12826624">Well, I think -- I think, it's an entirely different -- in a great difference in the way this left the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.971" offset="12847208">Let's try an example out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.167" offset="12860061">Suppose that I were asked questions about a conference with a client, and I said I refuse to answer because this involves something I said to my client, but not I'm not claiming Your Honor the lawyer type privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.333" offset="12924740">Under those circumstances, I would think it was fair for the Court to say, “Well, you haven't claimed the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.454" offset="12949191">You don't stand on it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.098" offset="12959744">At best, from the petitioner's standpoint, these things would seem to me to cancel out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.378" offset="12984926">Furthermore, I suggest Mr. Chief Justice that this was not a matter of just one assertion, that there was any possibility of misunderstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.938" offset="13019094">The Chairman of the Committee several times said to the petitioner, “Do I understand that you don't rely on the privilege against self-incrimination” and Senator Ervin said the same thing, and each time he said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.880" offset="13074892">Then the discussion with Senator Ervin went off to an effort to explicate, “Well, how could there be this other privilege under the Fifth Amendment, if you weren't relying on the privilege against self-incrimination?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.811" offset="13134660">And that was usually cut off and I think quite properly because the petitioner wasn't a lawyer, and was obviously in no position to discuss it, and quite obviously, was just reading what his lawyer had given him to read.</text>

            <text syncTime="3650.798" offset="14706604">So that there's no discrimination between the two in the way the Committee treated them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.342" offset="14732727">Because the essential difference in this case seems to us to turn on one's appraisal of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.196" offset="14776195">I wanted at the beginning of my argument to develop at little length exactly what happened in a broader context in the specific pleas made by Blaier and the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.144" offset="14843904">In the background of these hearings, were two transactions which I think it tried to characterize as related but quite distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.357" offset="14880789">One of them is what I would call the Indiana highway scandal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.526" offset="14897507">According to widespread reports, petitioner and two other union officials had bought land in Indiana for $20,000 in an area where it was expected to the state highway would be laid down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.123" offset="14955813">They bribed an official named Doggett in the Indiana Highway Department who dealt with the acquisition of rights of way, and then transferred the rights of way across this land to India -- to the State of Indiana for a highway for the sum of $78,000 or about four times what they paid for the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.807" offset="15046614">When questioned about this transaction before another Senate Committee some time before, petitioner claimed the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.095" offset="15087783">Prior to the hearings with which we are concerned, he and his associates had been indicted for this transaction, the highway scandal, in Marion County for a conspiracy to bribe, and actual bribery of Doggett.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.401" offset="15149014">It's plain that the indictment had not been tried prior to the time when petitioner was questioned by the McClellan Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.813" offset="15182660">The second and what I see is an entirely different transaction was what I will call the alleged obstruction of justice or colloquially an attempt to fix the investigation in Lake County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.217" offset="15244204">In July 1957, a year roughly after the land transactions have been completed, and after the reports of the alleged bribery were out, the prosecutor in Grand County of Lake -- a grand jury of Lake County began an investigation into the highway scandal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.446" offset="15321109">This was before the indictment had been returned in the Marion County seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.549" offset="15341589">After a few days, the Lake County investigation was dropped and Holovachka, the prosecutor had announced that there would be no indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.639" offset="15381922">Sometime later, information came to the attention of the McClellan Committee indicating that the investigation had been dropped at the request of the petitioner and his union associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.077" offset="15431659">As a result of the bribes that had been paid with labor union funds, and through a series of labor union transactions involving the Teamsters, and through the influence of union officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.557" offset="15485576">The information indicated that Holovachka, the Lake County prosecutor, had received Carpenters Union funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.779" offset="15522461">What Raddock, James Hoffa, Sawochka, the head of the big Teamsters Union in Lake County, Teamsters local in Lake County, were supposed to have been the intermediaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.811" offset="15578572">The Lake County investigation had been dropped shortly after some telephone calls had been made from a Chicago hotel to Hoffa and to Sawochka, the Teamster man, in Lake County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.159" offset="15640012">The calls have been made by Raddock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.656" offset="15654013">They were paid for with Carpenters Union funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.809" offset="15674598">At the time Raddock made the calls, petitioner Blaier and another Teamsters official had been staying in the same hotel, and the hotel bills had been paid for with labor union funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.715" offset="15734262">In addition, it appeared that Raddock who is alleged to have been the leading man, the obstruction of justice, had received $310,000 from the Carpenter's Union for preparing a biography of a former president of the union, the petitioner's father, and the evidence before the McClellan Committee had showed that the work at most should have cost about one-third of this amount, so that was $200,000 roughly unaccounted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.714" offset="15866232">Now, it's unquestionably true that the highway transaction in the alleged obstruction of justice were related in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.833" offset="15898728">The Lake County investigation which was believed to have been fixed by the use of union funds was an investigation into the highway transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.457" offset="15941151">Evidence that the petitioner attempted to stop the Lake County investigation might have been admissible against him in the trial of the Marion County indictment on the theory that it indicated consciousness that the effort to fix indicated the consciousness of guilt, and of course under familiar rules such evidence is admissible at a criminal trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.224" offset="16036237">But I would emphasize that in every other respect, these were two distinct transactions, separate in both time and place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.839" offset="16074689">The Marion County indictment could be and indeed it later was tried without any reference to the attempted obstruction of justice in Lake County, and the alleged obstruction of justice in Lake County could be investigated without hearing any evidence upon the bribery or the real estate transaction on account of which the Marion County indictment had been returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.668" offset="16186075">Taking up first now, the Lake County transactions, I submit that it was plainly a proper subject for investigation by the McClellan Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.334" offset="16228707">The authorizing resolution appears at page 176 of the record, down to the bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.307" offset="16272593">It established the Select Committee which was authorized and directed to conduct a study and investigation of the extent to which criminal or other improper practices or activities are or have been engaged in the field of labor-management relations or in groups or organization of employees or employers to the detriment of the interest of the public, employers or employees, and to determine whether any changes are required in the laws of United States in order to protect such interests against the occurrence of such practices or activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.319" offset="16428596">Petitioner argues in several points in his brief and summarized the argument here, and since this resolution authorized the McClellan Committee to investigate criminal activities, it directed the Committee to investigate the activities for their own sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.218" offset="16500276">And therefore, attempted unconstitutionally to have it act as sort of a legislative grand jury, prosecutor, and judge, thus, assuming powers which are given to the executive and judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.274" offset="16556492">The error of that view, it seems to me, becomes perfectly plain when one reached the whole resolution in the light of the legislative background.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.932" offset="16595048">Let me speak very briefly about the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.108" offset="16611767">At the time of the hearings, although the federal law protected and encouraged unionization and collective bargaining, there was no federal law dealing with the internal affairs of labor organizations, none relating to the expenditure or management of union funds, non-declaring or enforcing the fiduciary duties of labor union officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.807" offset="16702568">After some prior disclosures, Congress came -- became concerned about the question whether there should not be enacted federal legislation which would prevent the labor union leaders from abusing the power which they had obtained largely by virtue of federal legislation such as the National Labor Relations Act and the Taft-Hartley Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.680" offset="16802043">The extent to which there were criminal activities or other improper practices plainly would bear upon the need for such legislation, and in understanding of the way in which such practices were carried on would certainly be very helpful in framing a precise remedy in drafting the terms of the legislation, deciding which solutions to follow and which to reject.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.321" offset="16920639">Colonel Wiener says that there is no legislative practice because the resolution authorized the Committee to investigate criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.091" offset="16963688">Now first may I say that if his interpretation of criminal activity as applied to -- applies only to violations of federal law, then of course the Committee was not functioning under that part of the resolution in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.106" offset="17027845">It was functioning under the part of the resolution that authorized it to investigate other improper activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.017" offset="17055431">It would draw its authority from there, but I think this assumption is quite wrong if this context, the word “criminal” applies to criminal or other improper activities is not so precise, and it seems to me quite plain that it applies to federal crimes and state crimes equally.</text>

            <text syncTime="5446.442" offset="21889128">Well, I would think that it could be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.731" offset="21902294">I would differ with Your Honor as to have serious as is here, and I would also suggest that if -- if this case, where the subject matter and the actual question are so plainly material to the very thing that the Committee was authorized to do, to see what changes in the laws of United States were necessary, to prevent the continuation of this kind practice, which was injuring employees, employers, and the public, that it would take a far stronger showing than there is here to convict the Committee of any improper motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5486.524" offset="22049520">Now on -- as to the question of whether the Committee had an improper motive or whether that is relevant, I would like to call the Court's attention to two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.211" offset="22108244">First, it seems to me as I suggested earlier that it was clearly held in Watkins and later in Braden that where the inquiries are pertinent to the authorized purposes of the Committee and would aid Congress in preparing legislation in a field of the Committee's concern, federal concern, that in that event, the Court would inquire no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.032" offset="22219525">In Watkins, the Chief Justice said, “The solution to our problem is not to be found in testing the motives of Committee members to this purpose, such is not our function.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5539.954" offset="22263202">Their motives alone would not vitiate an investigation which had been instituted by House of Congress if that assembly's legislative purpose is being served, and that the inves -- that the facts sought to be obtained here would serve the Committee's legislative purpose and that it was a legislative purpose, seem to me to be really beyond any doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5565.602" offset="22365811">Furthermore, this case, although it really isn't necessary to go further, I think fairness to the Committee requires me to point out that the record does not support the attack which petitioner makes on the petition -- on the Committee's motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.404" offset="22432998">Most of his argument is centered about a statement made by the Chairman of the Committee which appears at page 152 of the record, begins way down at the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.052" offset="22499558">At this stage, the Committee had just completed this phase of its investigation, says -- say it apparently did not contemplate any further inquiry into the management of the Carpenters Union funds or into the alleged obstruction of justice in Lake County.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.259" offset="22576358">The Chairman stated first certain conclusions which he drew from the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.855" offset="22598823">It seems that at the very least, Mr. Hutcheson is President of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners was grossly careless with the use of union funds and completely failed to meet the responsibility as president.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.500" offset="22645321">This was certainly an authorized subject of investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5639.460" offset="22661204">Then he goes on at some length to describe the evidence which had been introduced about this biography and about Raddock's activities on behalf of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.993" offset="22723375">And then he said coming down, it's really quite a minor thing in the statement, testimony further indicates that certain high officials of both the Teamsters and Carpenters Union, two of the largest unions in the country, with the help and assistance of Mr. Raddock, were involved in a conspiracy to subvert justice in the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.961" offset="22807176">He does state there what conclusions, he as a member of the Senate, came to after hearing the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.025" offset="22851480">But I find nothing improper or nothing that would at least -- that would justify the Court in refusing to force -- to punish a witness for contempt, if he was guilty of contempt, is the fact that a member of the Senate Committee publicly stated what conclusions he had drawn from the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.328" offset="22944684">Neither does it seemed to me that the fact that he stated what conclusions he had drawn is enough to convict him of some improper purpose in answering the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="5958.752" offset="23938382">In the second place, surely, it is within limits of discretion, I concede for the sake of argument, surely up to the Committee to make up its mind when evidence becomes cumulative and it needs no more.</text>

            <text syncTime="5991.068" offset="24067636">That certainly within broad limit is a function for the Congressional Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="6023.988" offset="24199293">Similarly, it seems to be that there's a very little to the argument, it did nothing to the argument, that Colonel Wiener makes based on Mr. McClellan's testimony before the judge at the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6042.072" offset="24271705">The testimony is on page 153 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6045.840" offset="24286751">He was called to explain this statement that we -- excuse me, I got the wrong reference, 165 of the record, he was called to explain the statement that was put out at the end of the -- at the end of the hearing, the Senate hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6059.235" offset="24340355">And he said, “This was at the conclusion of the hearings in this particular investigation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6069.508" offset="24381419">At the conclusion, I made this brief statement which is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6074.105" offset="24399809">“Our legislative function had been performed in seeking information regarding crimes and improper activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6081.827" offset="24430634">Now, there I think what he is saying is that they in relation to the Lake County investigation, in relation to drawing the facts about the Lake County investigation, they were done, but I think in stretching that to say that that impliedly excludes any purpose to use the information later, in drafting legislation where the Committee was specifically charged with the duty of drafting legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6112.171" offset="24552051">What he's saying in effect is our legislative function, in relation to this Lake Country transaction, in relation to investigating was over.</text>

            <text syncTime="6123.225" offset="24596250">So then, since there was some evidence that a state crime had been committed, it's our practice to cooperate with the state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="6132.430" offset="24633135">So what I was saying was, my statement is to the effect that if the state officials desired to pursue any testimony that we had developed, we'd cooperate and make the record available.</text>

            <text syncTime="6219.112" offset="24979832">I think a fair way to state the question of law that this case raises is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6225.502" offset="25005432">We have on the one hand, this highway scandal which was a separate transaction on the indictment concerning it, raised many issues of fact, all of which were carefully avoided by the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.554" offset="25065618">We also have another transaction, the Lake County obstruction of justice or the alleged case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6259.660" offset="25142000">And the Committee asked questions only about the Lake County transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6265.381" offset="25164884">But it is true as I sought to say that the answers to those questions might have revealed a consciousness of guilt, and therefore, might have borne over on the trial of the Marion County Indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="6282.515" offset="25233429">What is that admissible enough?</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.557" offset="25241579">Now, the question is -- we're given -- whether given those facts, the committee could constitutionally put the questions to the witness which were pertinent to its investigation and tell him either to answer or claim the privilege of self -- privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6310.502" offset="25345337">We say that the right to put the questions under these circumstances is perfectly plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6316.510" offset="25369370">They were pertinent questions and that the fact that the answers might possibly affect the trial in the state indictment does not forbid the Committee to put the question that the way for the witness to protect himself is to claim the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6336.244" offset="25448364">We say, second, that in this case, for reasons I sought to state to the Chief Justice earlier, that we think the privilege plainly would have been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6348.805" offset="25498624">Perhaps it didn't have to be, but it was allowed in the case of four other witnesses who were understood to claim the privilege against self-incrimination and that's the slightest reason to think that if the petitioner had not disclaimed the privilege, it would have been allowed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6368.611" offset="25577827">In any event, since petitioner disavowed it, he could hardly be heard to say that it wouldn't have been allowed if he had made the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="6378.517" offset="25617429">There could have been, we submit, no -- or let me put it this way, that the dilemma that Colonel Wiener says the petitioner faced, where his answers would be used against him in the Indiana Case or his pleading the privilege would be used against him in the Indiana Case is unreal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6401.820" offset="25710634">In the first place, the privilege he did claim would be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6406.009" offset="25727457">Surely it would be the basis for his many adverse inferences against him as a claim of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.978" offset="25755251">Second, we think is the Slochower case, although it can be distinguished on the fact, in effect prohibits drawing adverse consequences from a federal claim of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6426.855" offset="25810840">Twining and Adamson against California have nothing to do with it, because and the Indiana (Inaudible) case has a little to do with it, because those are all about the effect of a state claim of privilege in a state proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6442.050" offset="25871548">And finally we say, with respect to this point, that any basic unfairness, if there was any, despite what I have said, should have been raised in the Indiana case, but at this point, it's entirely hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.023" offset="25939466">Petitioner might or might not have taken the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="6462.941" offset="25955140">The fact that he claimed the privilege might or might not have been invoked against the prosecutors or when the prosecutor attempted to invoke it, then and there was the time for him to claim the prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.888" offset="26006967">And if there was any basic unfairness, of course, he could have brought the case to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6482.116" offset="26031835">And if there was no basic unfairness, it certainly isn't any greater -- in this case, what is hypothetical and potential, that it would be in that case if it were accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6495.059" offset="26083558">So, what the case boils down to is, I submit, that petitioner is asserting that although he disclaimed the privilege against self-incrimination the Fifth Amendment gives him a right to obtain the same protection under another name.</text>
            <text syncTime="6514.101" offset="26159731">And we think that that falls of its own weight and indeed it's inconsistent with the view that one must claim the privilege, that it's not a right not to be asked a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6525.969" offset="26207274">And finally, that the introduction of such a doctrine, such reading this into the vaguer parts of the Fifth Amendment, when the fifth man is already adequately protected by the specific guarantee, would simply create confusion, and put a looseness into the Fifth Amendment which fortunately now is absent so far as the privilege against self-incrimination is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="6778.604" offset="27217795">Now, it's suggested by the prosecution that the way for Hutcheson to protect himself was to invoke the specific guarantee of the self-incrimination clause and not rely on the Due Process Clause, to which I think the answer is that if he relied on self -- if he invoked self-incrimination, he would be disadvantaging himself in three respects and he would not be adequately protected and only the Due Process Clause, it seems to me, would protect him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6814.620" offset="27361886">And then it suggested and here I do not understand the legal reasoning that this after all, if Your Honors please, don't take this too seriously, this was a mild sentence, it's true there were 18 counts that they build up against them, but they only got six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="6830.417" offset="27424998">I suppose if they've got the maximum, he could have had one year on 18 counts consecutively which would be 18 years and an $18,000 fine and would the questions before Your Honors be any different?</text>
            <text syncTime="6842.423" offset="27473063">Of course they were the same questions because the appellate court cannot revise sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="6848.183" offset="27496155">But the -- to me the most significant portion of Mr. Cox's argument was his introduction when at some length he denigrated my client by going into the details of the alleged conspiracy to subvert justice or to use a shorter word, the “fix.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6870.278" offset="27584449">Well, that showed pretty clearly that they didn't need this petitioner's answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6878.331" offset="27616737">They didn't need these answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6880.517" offset="27625409">They had the answers and then it seemed to me terribly significant that in reading from the Chairman's testimony at the trial, Mr. Cox in his argument omitted what Mr. Cox in his written argument omitted this sentence, “Our legislative purpose is to search out and find if crime has been committed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6909.388" offset="27740975">Now, I don't go into that as a notion of motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6914.705" offset="27762186">I distrust the attribution of motives because too often, when one person attributes motives to another, he's attributing his own baser emotions to someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="6928.139" offset="27815894">I refer to that not as a statement of motive but as a particularly authoritative statement of purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="6938.682" offset="27858108">Our legislative purpose is to search out and find if crime has been committed and up above it said, “Our legislative function had been performed in seeking information regarding the crimes and improper activities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6955.201" offset="27924146">And then when the Chairman had concluded, the Committee came in with the detailed pinpointed report on page 592.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.834" offset="27970748">This was incorporated by a reference at the request of the prosecution and they pinpointed this alleged conspiracy to obstruct justice and I submit that any competent legislative draftsman would have had enough from those legislative findings to draft a proper act to stop that in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="6988.949" offset="28059146">They didn't need -- they didn't need these petitioners' answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6994.926" offset="28083075">Well, Mr. Cox said that this is a very delicate matter for a court to tell a Committee when it has sufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7004.129" offset="28119855">I recall the Court, the case of United States versus Smith in the 286 United States where the Court in the very careful opinion by Mr. Justice Brandies had to interpret the Senate rules in order to determine whether George Otis Smith had been properly confirmed as a member of the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7025.669" offset="28206059">And to the argument that this Court cannot interpret the rules of the Senate, the answer was, we have to interpret the rules of the Senate when other people's rights depend on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7038.766" offset="28258408">Now, what is involved here is the consequences of judicial action and judicial power which up to now has been exerted with the view to sending this petitioner to jail for contempt of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7052.929" offset="28315042">I submit it is not only proper, it is necessary for this Court, in that situation to ascertain whether these questions were asked for any proper legislative purpose or whether they were asked simply to embarrass this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="7072.128" offset="28391842">The Committee had enough facts to make the accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7076.690" offset="28410128">They had enough facts for the Committee Chairman at the close of the petitioner's testimony to come in with a verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="7085.715" offset="28446281">They had enough facts when the staff got together the Committee report to come in with very detailed findings as to what went on in Lake County and why did they want the petitioner there?</text>
            <text syncTime="7099.305" offset="28500616">They wanted him either to admit or to plead the privilege against self-incrimination in circumstances that would have disadvantaged him in three respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="7108.591" offset="28537710">Now, I submit, that is the -- that is the -- as I see it, the vital focus of this case, is it asking questions for a legitimate legislative purpose when you're asking one man 18 questions, not for information, but in the colloquial sense, to put him on the spot, to embarrass him, to make him subject to penalties, to make him claim a privilege which will not wholly protect him, which will carry a stigma and which will disadvantage him.</text>
            <text syncTime="7140.283" offset="28664456">I submit, if the Court please, that those questions are not questions asked for legitimate legislative fact finding purposes.</text>
