            <text syncTime="3.385" offset="116903">Before the recess, I was just concluding the coverage of certain statistics and I would just like to add to that, that these figures are available to the Court from independent means, that is from the annual reports of the Administrative Office of the Federal Courts, also from the annual report of the Attorney General would give an appraisal to this problem and in addition, the brief in the Lurk case in the last term do contain these very particular figures that I have referred to, the 60 figure of being granted to the District Court to 43 in the Court of Appeals and those figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.571" offset="261622">Now this petitioner, of course, was denied forma pauperis for the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.876" offset="278862">But the issues in this case are not to be found in the granted column as opposed to the denied column because many of the cases in which the Court of Appeals initially considers under the processes here do eventually go on to become cases in which oral argument is granted so that there is a difference to be made in just a column choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.522" offset="1669413">As a result of this mechanical distinction being made, and because of the efficiency built into the processes, the actual results in the Court of Appeals are altered more expeditious in this kind of case than they are in a regular appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.577" offset="1877661">Now, as a matter of selecting cases for review, if Your Honors have noticed, some cases do not go through this review that the Court -- this particular case did.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.026" offset="1919457">The matter of deciding which cases will get the review by the transcript of proceedings is the heart of the issues in this case, and that process is best identified and understood by the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.272" offset="1972433">As I suggested to Mr. Justice Whittaker earlier, the record is entirely here every pleadings of note that was filed in the Court of Appeals is put forth in a sequence here in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.508" offset="2025409">And on page 1 of the record is the prisoner's own pre se petition for forma pauperis, and it's a well-done petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.957" offset="2059160">It's much better than the normal petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.315" offset="2068668">On the basis of that petition at record page 5, the Court of Appeals without waiting for the time to elapse for the Government to oppose the prisoner's petition, did appoint him counsel, Mr. Boskey was appointed by the order appearing on page 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.456" offset="2137213">As a result of his appointment, Mr. Boskey prepared a petition in support of the memorandum and support of the petition which begins on page 5 and which continues on, for some 20 of these record pages to record page 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.164" offset="2212028">And as I've suggested to the Court earlier, he was given a full opportunity to discuss the issues which were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.093" offset="2247764">Record page 27 is the conclusion of the memorandum by Mr. Boskey and this conclusion I think is in support of the process which eventually followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.282" offset="2300531">And he concludes and I quote, “In the foregoing presentation, it's a substantial question to which appeared to exist on appeal so far as such a matter can be assessed in the absence of a transcript, but there may be various other substantial questions disclosed for the transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.092" offset="2423724">Implicit in the statement I would add is also the contrary to the effect that that evaluation might react contrary to his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.187" offset="2460087">And this is the basic proposition to the system that we're discussing, which is that criminal cases do have their roots so deeply embedded in the patch of the case as distinct from distinguishing cases, Presslor cases and that sort thing, the question of whether the facts support the legal arguments are so altered, determinative of the processes and issues, determined indeed whether or not this particular process, the review by transcript, as I term it, is a valid process or not a valid process, because that is the rock bottom of the consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.089" offset="2627688">Passing onto this record though, to show that full and complete consideration was given to this matter by the court, after Mr. Boskey's statement was filed, the Government on page 31, filed a very short document in which it conceded that the transcript was needed, but the concession was limited in it's purport to one of the three issues which Mr. Boskey raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.546" offset="2729566">Government in effect said that the indictment is not a valid issue that the disqualification of Judge Holtzoff is not a valid issue, but the matter of (Inaudible) and admissibility were his testimony is something that we do need to look at the transcript and suggested that the entitlement to an appeal be based rock bottom on what that transcript showed on that one issue, and suggested that Mr. Boskey after he received the transcript should again present a memorandum to the court based on that transcript of proceedings, having received it.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.285" offset="2872508">Mr. Boskey came back in the next several pages in which he talks about delay in the judicial process and suggests amongst other things that his client was entitled, as of the moment, to go to oral argument with his case despite the contention that the back record might well show to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.629" offset="2961847">He also complained, of course, that he should not have to come forward at that point with the transcript himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.497" offset="2989328">Now the order of the Court of Appeals is note worthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.054" offset="3003538">It grants a transcript and in that sense it complies at least in part with the rule of the Ellis case, but the Court of Appeals ordered, which appears on page 34, is a response to this situation which it was confronted with.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.272" offset="3064456">It did not ask Mr. Boskey to come forward for the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.890" offset="3078980">Instead, it said to the Government, “You come forward with your transcript -- with your memorandum based on the transcript.”</text>
            <text syncTime="751.340" offset="3108760">Now, as I construe these proceedings, terminology is not there, but in effect, the Government was put to burden of showing cause in its next move after the transcript, showing cause based on that transcript why this case should not go to oral argument, and that of course is exactly what the Government proceeded to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.517" offset="3201442">But this one order, insignificant though it appears on its face, this order, on page 34 of the record which grants a transcript is the beginning and indeed the heart of this process which is challenged by my opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.649" offset="3273958">He says, “Instead of getting only a transcript, I should've gotten forma pauperis which allowed me immediately to proceed to the in rem result of oral argument” and that which he did not want to have his case reviewed in the light of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.374" offset="3340831">He wanted and instead to go into a posture where the implicit order of forma pauperis would put him in a position, put it in a route where it might not be looked at any further until the turn -- time of oral argument and he wanted his case in that position where it would not be looked at any further until the time of oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.861" offset="3454830">One other fact, I think, is significant about this order on page 34 that appears on its face, the final disposition in this case was a split decision of three judges in the sense that Judge Bazelon did note his dissent, no opinion but he noted this dissent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.277" offset="6368528">The trial was he said is a pure and simple direct proposition of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.700" offset="6382216">Artis' testimony should not come in because I don't have the opportunity of giving it the second go around cross-examination and the District Court says, “The cases are against you” and indeed they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.151" offset="6427982">The Mattox case in this Court is directly against that proposition and counsel doesn't really argue against the Mattox case at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.829" offset="6462673">Now, the second reason which was offered in a trial level for rejection of Artis' testimony was the fact that this document, which I have in my hand and which on record page 22, was now in counsel's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.395" offset="6524949">And it's signed twice as counsel said by Artis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.626" offset="6537906">Now, the proposition advanced at the trial level, as distinct from here, was that because of this document, Artis' sworn testimony at first trail should not come in, the earlier testimony should not come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.101" offset="6583777">As I understand his argument now, his main argument is to the effect well, the first trial testimony should come in but this document also come in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.168" offset="6667995">And he said, “Well, I'm not sure how I got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.136" offset="6679907">I've found it in the records and files which I got from one of the several attorneys which had represented this petitioner on an earlier trial -- in the earlier trial, or earlier proceedings, but I don't know which file it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.910" offset="6767052">Now the -- the initial decision by Judge Holtzoff was to the effect that, “Well, if it's written up in Artis' handwriting and if it is a valid document and all, I'll let them both go in, I'll let the sworn testimony before the jury in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.129" offset="6827865">I'll let your document go in to the evidence also.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.063" offset="6843643">But, later on, Judge Holtzoff, in actually looking at the document, found that it was -- number one and that no continuity was shown for the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.702" offset="6882200">It just suddenly appeared, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.709" offset="6898186">Some question but at least it could have perhaps been shown whether Artis signed it or not, but it's not a dated document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.810" offset="6926608">No tab appears on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.264" offset="6932459">It could well have been, we suggest, and have in our brief, that this document was signed by Artis before Artis' trial in the first testimony in the first trial, so that his testimony represents the latest and the best.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.907" offset="6999019">And if it were indeed in the files of one of the other counsel's, it perhaps could have been used if they had saw fit to do so to impeach and discredit Artis in the first trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.367" offset="7480822">Even if it goes to the first, it doesn't go to the second and the second and latter which was the barring of Artis' testimony in the first trial was what counsel sought in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.428" offset="7525125">And that matter was disclosed by the transcript of proceedings and as I say, this is an example in support of the transcript review process which is the main issue I think in this case, a look at the transcript of proceedings and not a very hard look.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.221" offset="7608299">It doesn't take very long to ascertain the fact that counsel, when he said to the Court, number one, he want to put up -- to exclude Artis' sworn testimony in the first trial, but counsel immediately at the -- almost the outset of his introduction, he said to the court, “I can't vouch for this document or in effect said that I can't vouch for it because I don't know where it came from.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.221" offset="13112299">Fourth, we were deprived an adjudication on the merits in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.739" offset="13130376">We don't know what the Court of Appeals decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.315" offset="13140616">We don't know what they considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.727" offset="13146258">We don't how they considered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.560" offset="13153573">We don't know whether they considered it in concert or singling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.753" offset="13170395">That is not the treatment which have (Inaudible) appeal gets in the Court of Appeals, and that's what we are entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.279" offset="13192443">So that if after all of that and we had that kind of treatment on the merits, we then wanted to file a petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.503" offset="13221386">This Court then wouldn't have had any difficulty knowing what the Court of Appeals had and hadn't done.</text>
