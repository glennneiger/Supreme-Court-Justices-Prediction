            <text syncTime="24.071" offset="199659">And then I began to go on to point out that even before acquiring Kinney, Brown had begun to tie up retail outlets because we think that’s a relevant circumstance in determining whether this tying-up more of it was a substantial factor in lessening competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.094" offset="279698">I pointed out already that Brown had acquired Wohl, the largest operator of leased outlets and department stores.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.851" offset="618768">In addition to the owned outlets on through these firms that it acquired, Brown also had 584 franchise dealers at the time of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.122" offset="679894">Firms which were received assistance from Brown in various forms and in return for which they committed themselves at one time not to purchase from other competing manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.505" offset="733393">On advice of counsel as the record puts in, that was eliminated from the written contract and was watered down to a commitment not to carry any conflicting lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.566" offset="781667">And if a Brown franchise dealer were to carry a conflicting line, unless it was a casual incident, he would be cut off as a Brown franchise dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.651" offset="834017">There were a number of advantages in being a Brown franchise dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.517" offset="853452">One was that you were able to purchase rubber-soled canvass shoes at a discount from Goodrich and otherwise that you've got the benefits and certain advantages in the form of insurance, both group life insurance and also buyer casualty insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.057" offset="931610">Still another advantage as I understand it was that also some of the outlets might get occasional health and merchandising and inventory control in planning their stocks and architectural design.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.134" offset="987930">There is testimony quoted in that brief to the effect that you got this far more regularly and successfully, if you are a Brown franchise dealer which carried with it, I emphasize, the obligation not to use -- not to -- to concentrate in Brown shoes and therefore to exclude conflicting lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.771" offset="1074448">Now, it's true you could quit at anytime, but the bait was there, if I may it colloquially.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.588" offset="1093674">You got certain advantages that you gave up if you quit and as long as you were a Brown franchise dealer, this was an outlet which was wholly or which was partially foreclosed at least so far as shoes competing with Brown were concerned.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="282.613" offset="1233795">The total number was constantly growing.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.644" offset="1241945">There were 470 in 1950, 584 at the time of the merger, 647 in 1958, so that this is an increasing part of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.187" offset="1296071">The Kinney Shoe Company, we discussed it's less important manufacturing facilities before.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.664" offset="1321984">As a retailer, it was in that capacity that it was important to Brown and is significant here and has its major significance here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.531" offset="1369527">It was the largest retail chain of family shoe stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.632" offset="1385932">It had 352 stores in 312 cities and it too was rapidly growing. For example, from the time of the merger until 1958, its stores increased to 418, an increase of 80%.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.231" offset="1456253">If you look at its outlets and shopping centers, too, there were 50 in 1955, a 118 three years later and 136 -- an increase of a 136%.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.929" offset="1515081">In 1955, Kinney's sales were 6,400,000 pairs of shoes purchased from outside sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.540" offset="1553533">And is other than in addition to its own manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.234" offset="1572342">It sold, lumping them all together, 1.3% of the national total.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.198" offset="1604211">Broken down into the three categories, Kinney sold 1.7% of children's shoes, 1.4% of women's shoes, there was a much smaller factor in the men's shoe market, only 3%.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.329" offset="1660740">So that to pull this together, the merger combined the fourth and 13th largest manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.197" offset="1692191">The fourth largest manufacturer in the market with the most aggressive and largest of the independent retailers having 1.7% of the children's market and 1.4% of the women's and less than one-half of 1% of the market for men's shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.165" offset="1772022">And we come to the question whether the vertical effect of this merger would substantially lessen the competition -- might substantially lessen the competition in any line of commerce, in any section of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.256" offset="1836387">Our argument which I think I outlined before is that Brown's capture of Kinney's outlets violates Section 7 because its tendency will be to foreclose competition and send -- selling shoes to Kinney and that this segment of the market, the Kinney segment under all the circumstances of this industry is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.586" offset="1921755">So that the three elements, we must attend to.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.694" offset="1934190">First, we must define the market in terms of the section of the country and the product or line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.354" offset="1964805">Second, I have to address myself to the question, is there a reasonably likelihood that the acquisition will lessen the competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.451" offset="1997197">And then third, I must show, of course, that the substantial share of the market is affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.231" offset="2024260">Geographically, the market is a matter of common agreement, so far as manufacturer's market is concerned that that's what we're now talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.108" offset="2059786">Geographically, we all agree that it's nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.918" offset="2071071">And there's no reason to discuss that any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.669" offset="2086013">In terms of the product or line of commerce, the District Court found that the relevant market was for men's shoes, women's shoes and children's shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.009" offset="2131362">And I turn to the question in a moment whether those findings are supported by the elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.847" offset="2154768">It seems to me important first to direct our minds and little bit to the question of what are we looking for and why are we looking for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.878" offset="2182875">When we talk about line of commerce or market, as I see it, that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.637" offset="4321886">I point out that 48% of Brown's sales of men's shoes and 42% of Kinney's sales were in the $7 to $10 price bracket.</text>

            <text syncTime="1070.713" offset="4386252">That 48% of Brown's sales of men's shoes and 42% of Kinney's sale of men's shoes were in to $7 to 9.99 price bracket, I think I said $10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.393" offset="4448946">Similarly, there were lines of Brown's women's shoes -- Air Steps, Life Strides, Glamour Debs, which were competitive with the shoes sold by Kinney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.478" offset="4497324">27% of Brown's women's shoes and 35% of Kinney's were within the $3 bracket, about $4 to $7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.707" offset="4546226">And among children's shoes, the figures, without taking time to read them were substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.294" offset="4572557">In addition to the overlap on prices, one of the most persuasive testimonies in my mind was the repeated testimony from my -- string of retailers in perhaps 40 of the -- or more of these cities, testifying from their actual experience that their stores were competitive with Brown and Kinney's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.144" offset="4659911">Sometimes, it would be a Brown retailer and he testified that Kinney was his competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.673" offset="4682062">One finds such expressions, as I took Kinney shoes off the soles of my customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.907" offset="4702960">People told me that they had been shopping down at Kinney and they were coming up in the street and shopping here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.899" offset="4730964">There was testimony from the Brown and Kinney executives which corroborates this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.823" offset="4750712">Brown said that it aimed to the middle income and what we call the lower price market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.266" offset="4772446">And Kinney defined its market as the middle income and lower income group of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.277" offset="4796479">And the -- Mr. Dean in his brief, stresses wide divergence in merchandising methods, style, advertising, and the like, but of course, when you're selling differentiated products today, those are the heart of competition rather than evidence of a lack of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.652" offset="4877981">Now, I come to the application of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.530" offset="4901491">And again to the key phrase, first, whether the effect of the acquisition maybe to substantially lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.368" offset="4944854">At first, it seems to me necessary to find the market, both geographically and in terms of the product or line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.951" offset="4991143">In terms of the line of commerce, the District Court found that the retail products were or lines of commerce were men's, women's and children's shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.905" offset="5035029">Now, I point out that the evidence shows that this is the way the trade is organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.068" offset="5055613">This is the way retailers speak to themselves, they sell men's shoes, they sell women's shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.033" offset="5079542">The stores are either men's, women's or children's or family shoe stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.596" offset="5105768">Again, showing the way the industry is organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.288" offset="5116531">And Brown's own organization heads up to executives in charge of those branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.852" offset="5142758">It's true that there can conceivably be finer divisions by style and price but the District Court found, following the testimony that they were quite impracticable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.509" offset="5189360">In the first place, he had testimony from retailer witnesses -- live witnesses that the high prices do compete with the low prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.210" offset="5224260">He had evidence of an interchangeability of users nor is this one dramatic instance was the president of Brown came in to testify one day, wearing what were called dress shoes and the next day, he came in to testify wearing casual shoes which underscored the point that these classifications do not really indicate the uses or lack of competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.469" offset="5421223">There was also, as I said, before direct testimony from the retailer witnesses, all of which is outlined in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.630" offset="5465840">Now the District Court found that geographically, the market at retail is the city and the immediate surrounding and contiguous area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.424" offset="5533027">There, again, he had testimony of witnesses describing what was the market, and there are 40 out of the 138 cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.657" offset="5570017">And I think that this is indisputably a fair sample.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.866" offset="5586840">Anyone who suggests that the others of the 138 or somehow, that unique, surely has the burden to do it and the appellants called that no -- called one live retailer witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.308" offset="5640652">There were good many experts and many, many statistics but only, if my memory is right, one live witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.968" offset="5675238">The Government's expert testified that normally you find 85 to 90 of the sales in marketing concentrated in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.065" offset="5711600">And the Court reviewed the detailed evidence about Saint Louis and found that there, also of course, a retailer on one side of the city does not compete with a retailer way over on the other side of the city but still, they're in competition with each other all the way along the line with theirs in the middle in competition with those on either side of him and that therefore, the most practical line was the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.424" offset="5841063">The question then arises whether despite the fact that the practical market is the city and it's immediately surrounding area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.875" offset="5890905">This qualifies as a “section of the country.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.495" offset="5909400">As I understand the appellant's argument to which Mr. Justice Frankfurter was adverting or the question that Mr. Justice Frankfurter mentioned, it is in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.314" offset="5952658">First, is Mr. Justice Frankfurter suggesting the statute did take out the word “in any community” and uses simply the term “in any section of the country.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.651" offset="6010023">And the contention is made that that signifies that a city cannot be qualified as a section of the country and as the justice said, “Well, you can't add a lot of separate discrete cities and get a section.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.150" offset="6079927">Then the other point on which appellant relies in this connection is the testimony of Mr. Kelley who was general council of Federal Trade Commission who at one point said the combination of department stores in New York, this was in testifying, would not violate the proposed bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.225" offset="6148263">He later indicated that New York City might be a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.488" offset="6165295">This was only testimony and it seems to me that no very firm conclusions can be predicated about it under those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.506" offset="6321403">Now, I'm coming to the change in the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.237" offset="6336345">It's unquestionably true that this was intended to make possible some mergers between little fellows that Section 7 would have forbidden before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.218" offset="6392247">And the day the example was given in the senate report, that the use of the term “community” stirred a storm of controversies since it was argued the Act was worded might go so far as to prevent any local enterprise in the small town from buying up a local enterprise the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.481" offset="6465285">As the consequence, the word “community” was dropped from subsequent versions of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.545" offset="6485556">Now, I think that one way of stating the question is whether there to indicate that any combination in a town or a city or even in a succession of towns or cities is exempt from the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.533" offset="6545533">We say not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.433" offset="6549086">We say first, that one must consider the substantial and meaningful problem that is addressed to not only in the terms of the Congressional Amendment in 1950 but that we're considered with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.865" offset="6622856">We're concerned with actual markets reflecting business dealings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.308" offset="6644590">Market such as that economists or businessmen would choose regardless of the verbal geographical definition as the area of effective competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.166" offset="6692028">And one of our troubles is -- well, let me back up just a little, we think this is entirely clear not only for the common sense that you've got to deal with business markets, business practice but also, is -- it's revealed that this is a question from a legislative history in the right approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.976" offset="6771231">The reported sales said, “What constitutes a section will vary with the nature of the product owing to the differences in size and character of markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.765" offset="6810415">It would be meaningless from an economic point of view to attempt to apply for all products a uniform definition of section,” but such definition were based on miles, population, income or any other unit of measurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.981" offset="6867257">The section which would be economically significant for a heavy durable product such as large machines tools might be meaningless for a light product such as milk which certainly sounds in terms of a retail consumers market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.579" offset="6925667">And of course was so applied although this Court didn't pass on the point in the Virginia-Maryland Milk Producers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.460" offset="6953253">Then it went on as the Supreme Court stated in Standard Oil Company against U.S. Since it is the preservation of competition which is at stake, the significant proportion of coverage is that within the area of effective competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.545" offset="7017514">And it did went on in the report in very much those terms, so that we think our practical businessman or economist as the expert put it, definition of market, is the decisive thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.998" offset="7099329">Now, someone may say in reply, “Well, what effect are you giving then to taking the word “community” out?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.944" offset="7123153">And I would say, “We were giving two effects”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.513" offset="7137468">One is that the bill would longer be applicable to a merger between two little fellows in a single little town, that before a city can qualify as a section, it must be sizable enough to have some interstate or national significance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.406" offset="7316982">Second, we think in this case that it is permissible to consider the fact that not just one retail trade area is included but that a number of retail trade areas are included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.362" offset="7388871">The 138, by our computation and according to the evidence because the question after all must have been whether the lessening of competition in a line of commerce was of enough importance for Congress to take note of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.214" offset="7488240">The argument that a single city and its environment cannot be a section would prove too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.695" offset="7526170">It would prove that there was no intention to have this amendment applied to retailing at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.771" offset="7638497">It becomes more a functional concept, a concept of importance to the whole country rather than a matter of drawing a line on the map that could be called a section.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1961.350" offset="7948727">I would like now, if I may, because I think that is simply a point that I can't add to the test that we got over, it seems to me that what we say is consistent with the interpretation of the statute in light of its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.485" offset="8009331">I would like now, if I may, to go back to the question of the vertical combination between one of the dominant firms, manufacturing facilities and the major independent remaining outlet in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.696" offset="8086131">I had pointed that the outlet buys 1.7% of all men's shoes, 1.5%, I think it is of all the children's, and a smaller percentage of -- no, I got it wrong -- 1.7 of women's, 1.5 of children's and a much smaller percentage of all men's shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.152" offset="8175992">The claim is that by putting these together, Brown is foreclosing selling opportunities for other manufacturers and thus, substantially lessening competition in the manufacturer's market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.916" offset="8254986">Now, they sell all over the country, this problem about “section of the country” does not arise in connection with the manufacturers' market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.312" offset="8296573">With respect to what is the appropriate line of commerce, I suggest that before looking at the evidence, we consider, why does one look at the line of commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.453" offset="8345161">And the reason as I see it is, is that it bears out of the section of substantiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.812" offset="8370657">Substantiality is a matter of relative as well as absolute size.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.705" offset="8394167">And to determine the relative size of the Kinney market, you have to decide in what line of commerce or what market set Kinney sells.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.585" offset="8433664">So that the -- so the question of line of commerce in this part of the case boils down to the question, “What is the market in which Kinney purchases?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.871" offset="8474833">The similarities and differences between Brown's production and Kinney's production which cover pages of the appellant's brief are utterly irrelevant because we're concerned with the vertical, not a horizontal merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.783" offset="8530526">Now, this one other respect in which the distinctions between Brown's production and Kinney's purchases in terms of style, price and so forth, may be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.828" offset="8578696">The differences may bear on the extent to which Brown can fill Kinney's needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.345" offset="8608789">And that in turn, of course, would bear on the question whether this may substantially lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.619" offset="8633866">But in terms of the market in which Kinney buys, I simply submit that if you look at the range in which Kinney buys, which you will conclude that the only possible way of describing it is men's, women's and children's shoes that it covers such a broad price range, the figures are in the brief, that there isn't any other way of putting it and that the propriety of doing that is emphasized by the testimony I mentioned earlier about what ultimately happens on the retail and after the shoes were passed through Kinney.</text>

            <text syncTime="2187.126" offset="8851832">That was rejected and it was narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.590" offset="8861759">Of course, I should say that I don't quite understand why Mr. Dean wishes to narrow the line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.403" offset="8889031">If he does, he hasn't ever stated what his line of commerce is because the more you narrow the line of commerce, while you may find that this little effect in some lines, you will find that there's a much bigger effect in others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.801" offset="8950575">For example, if you said that the line of commerce involved here was women's shoes to the middle and low income groups, that Kinney's proportion would rise a great deal, so would Brown's because neither of them sells the expensive shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.952" offset="9019225">And if you narrow it down to a particular price line, you will, without taking the time, find some price line in which Kinney has not 1.7% of the women's shoes but 3% of the women's shoes, and Brown could make them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.639" offset="9097906">And the statute says, “In any line of commerce” so that while we think that the District Court's findings were right, we think that any narrowing would lead to the conclusion that we had a stronger case with respect to some particular line although not to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.537" offset="9181497">So I come then to the question whether the combination is, one, the effect of which maybe to lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.008" offset="9215352">As I pointed out earlier, this is in terms of function just like the du Pont General Motors case, and the thesis here is much like the thesis in the du Pont General Motors case, it rest as was in the Columbia Steel case upon the very high probability that a subsidiary will deal only with its parent for goods that the parent could fragment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.869" offset="9330813">And what the other manufacturers in the industry are concerned about, the Government is considered about is that Brown will take over these markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.611" offset="9365817">Now, can Brown manufacture the shoes needed by Kinney?</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.533" offset="9385462">In the first place, I should point out that the tables in the back of the appellant's briefs are highly misleading, if they are intended to bear on this point -- if you would turn, for example, to page 7 (a), the next to the last page in Mr. Dean's main brief, you will find that he has set forth the percentage distribution of Brown's production -- using Brown's at the various price ranges, using Brown's production as the total universe and the percentage distribution of Kinney purchases using all Kinney's purchases as the total universe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.384" offset="9560900">With comparing percentages with percentages, doesn't give you any indication worthwhile at least of the extent to which Brown's volume of production are types of shoes it produces are such as Kinney would normally find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.451" offset="9629132">Take for example, just about in the middle of the chart, the manufacturers' price range, -- $5.40 down to $4.81.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.770" offset="9670405">And the figures set forth, there are 18.9% of Brown's production is in that range and 31% of Kinney's purchases are in that range.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.648" offset="9713977">Now, if you use absolute numbers, Brown produces 640,000 pairs of shoes, men's shoes other than work in that range and Kinney buys 113,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.339" offset="9776776">So Brown can make all the shoes Kinney would want in that price range so far as price range is bare on this, without any convergence or change whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.683" offset="9826095">This is one illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.194" offset="9836126">Others are equally dramatic, others show that Brown could make only part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.150" offset="9863920">Measured by the existing overlap at 1955 prices, Brown could supply 35% of the men's shoes needed by Kinney, 30% of the women's shoes and 50% of the children's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.194" offset="9932152">But we think the figures should be pushed a great deal higher than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.219" offset="9952214">In the first place, Brown can adapt its production to Kinney's needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.025" offset="9979486">It's makeup division, which Mr. Dean tells us he's losing money, sold 19,000,000 shoes in 1950 and 34,000,000 shoes in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.275" offset="10028492">Apparently there, he could've possessed in losing money as they thought it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.440" offset="10045106">The makeup division is the one that sells manufacturers' other brands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.629" offset="10065899">Brown opened 18 new factories between 1945 and 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.242" offset="10088364">When you open a new factory, of course, you have a chance to put in new machinery and to hire a new work force and this problem of piece rates doesn't get involved at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.121" offset="10127862">It made 13 major changes in machinery in the five year period, 1951 to 1955, again, this sort of thing that lends itself to the adaptation of your production facilities to your market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.046" offset="10187525">And there was from manufacturers, a great deal of -- well, there was testimony -- ample testimony that supports for the District Court's finding that manufacturers are able to convert their production to somewhat different lines up or down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.509" offset="10257429">It is true that the habits of workers in working at a certain piece rate tend to impose some restraint provided you don't open a new factory or put in entirely new machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.665" offset="10309987">But at the same time, as these manufacturers explain, there are ways and terms of the kind of material you used, the way you have cut it, and other ways of manufacturing for a particular market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.291" offset="10368502">Furthermore, it should be pointed out that there was a drawing together to train Brown's price ranges at Kinney's because Kinney was beginning to upgrade as it went into the suburban markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.786" offset="10422523">And Brown was also seeking to emphasize the new markets in the suburban areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.398" offset="10444988">And in those areas, their lines would naturally tend to merge without any convergence of the machineries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.199" offset="10480201">Would Brown take over Kinney's purchases?</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.720" offset="10494203">Well, we know something about what would happen from the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.128" offset="10519907">Brown had acquired other firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.648" offset="10534013">The appellants at page 188 of their brief make a good deal of the fact that when Brown purchased Wetherby-Kayser, Wetherby-Kayser kept on purchasing from other manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.484" offset="10593259">They set forth their purchases from other manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.491" offset="10617292">No, I guess their total purchases and down below it, the purchases from other manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.651" offset="10637981">You might be interested in writing in under the purchases from all manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.591" offset="10657729">The purchases from Brown, 28,801 in 1951, before the merger, 23,144 in 1952, the year of the merger, 137,958 in 1953, after the merger, 1954, I can't find, 1955, 282,000 in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.050" offset="10799522">In other words, Wetherby-Kayser's purchases from Brown in those five years increased 10 fold whereas the purchases as a total had only doubled, so that there's a marked tendency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.948" offset="10863156">I pointed out just before the recess in answer to a question from Justice Whittaker that this same kind of thing had happened, when Brown took over Wohl.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.448" offset="10905161">Wohl's total purchases between 1950 and 1957 increased 60%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.790" offset="10934523">Wohl's purchases from Brown increased from 2,800,000 to 12,000,000 or 320%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.798" offset="10974542">Brown had been in 1950, doing it quickly, something more than 10% of Wohl's total purchases and it increased to something more than 33% of Wohl's total purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.376" offset="11032848">In our brief, we have pointed out that there was the same drawing together of purchases and sales between companies within the unit when Brown took over Regal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.954" offset="11083212">Now, so far as Kinney is concerned, Brown is taking over the Kinney purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.251" offset="11112364">And I think that in measuring their effect, one should note first that this isn't the beginning of the merger and second that this has been a litigation all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.568" offset="11161684">Nevertheless, Brown had made no sales to Kinney prior to the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.857" offset="11194807">The next year, 8% of all Kinney's purchases came from Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.101" offset="11219780">Brown had already become Kinney's largest single supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.566" offset="11245589">Adding what had happened in the case of other firms, to what had happened in the beginning, in the case of Kinney, and to the probabilities that a manufacturer would use, so far as possible, it's own captive outlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.609" offset="11321762">It seems to us that it is certainly fair to conclude here that there will be a tendency for Brown to foreclose the Kinney market to other manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.591" offset="11365752">Now, this is isn't just something that we've thought of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.823" offset="11386650">The President of Brown in buying Kinney had this very thing in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.194" offset="11412146">He was asked when he was testified that what was your primary purpose in acquiring the stock of Kinney's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.740" offset="11442343">It was our feeling in addition to getting a distribution into a field of crisis which we were not covered, was also the feeling that if Kinney moved into shopping centers in these freestanding stores, they were going into a higher income neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.633" offset="11501902">And they would probably find the necessity of upgrading and adding additional lines to their very successful operation that they have been doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.329" offset="11536697">And it would give us an opportunity we hope to be able to sell them in that category.</text>

            <text syncTime="2881.299" offset="11628544">It's on that evidence that we think that the Court was amply justified in finding that this may tend to lessen competition in manufacturers' selling opportunities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2899.405" offset="11700955">1.7% in the case of women's shoes, about that for children, and less for men's, is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.794" offset="11742542">What is substantial is of course not simply a quantitative method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.785" offset="11762500">But I think that it's worth pointing out that we are talking about 6.4 million pairs of shoes a year at a cost of $16,000,000 almost $17,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.285" offset="11820492">This acquisition, since substantiality is a matter of relative size as well as absolute size, was an acquisition by one of the giants.</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.042" offset="12355584">The processes of vertical integration were already narrowing the market for independent manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.073" offset="12387662">Between 1950 and 1955, the big six manufacturers had purchased 13 retail chains with 13,000 outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.550" offset="12441579">Between 1948 and 1954, I'm sorry these jumped around so in the years but those were the figures that were available, the percentage of stores owned by chains with 101 stores or more increased 62% so that by the time of the merger, they constituted 33% of all shoe stores, again, evidence of the concentration of buying power in the manufacturer's market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.784" offset="12562474">The franchise program was growing very rapidly, as I pointed out earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.551" offset="12585566">Between 1945 and 1956, the big six manufacturers increased their own owned-and-operated outlets and this leaves out the franchise dealers from 14,000 to 38,000, a 170% increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.926" offset="12663097">Other manufacturers were pursuing this same policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.240" offset="12684309">Indeed, one of the basic problems is that this is a self-feeding reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.174" offset="12712103">When Brown who had been selling shoes in Los Angeles through the (Inaudible), found that the (Inaudible) had been bought up by one of the other big manufacturers, Brown rushed in and bought Wetherby-Kayser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.714" offset="12770200">When Florsheim was brought up by one of the other three big manufacturers, Brown rushed in and bought up Regal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.864" offset="12802800">And indeed, the nature of this interplay or chain reaction was explained by Brown's president in a statement in 1955, which I think chose that this process is likely to continue unless it is stopped here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.466" offset="12873226">My view point can pretty well be summed up like this, “One of our objectives in acquiring retail stores is to protect and guarantee distribution of our products in areas where independent retailers could not give our brands adequate distribution because of their affiliations with other branded manufacturers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.220" offset="12956296">The gist of the case, as we see it, is that when you take this trend, that if is allowed to continue that this market will cease to be open and competitive to all manufacturers and characterized by a lot of small manufacturers and that in this industry, the opportunities for the small businessmen, as unhappily they have in others, will be lost.</text>

            <text syncTime="3253.518" offset="13117419">The other point which I won't take time to emphasize in full, thank you Mr. Chief Justice, is that when you note the effect through the vertical integration in the manufacturers' market and note the effect of the horizontal integration in the retail market, and add them together, that they then concentrate economic power and give the combination a leverage, a power in the market that puts everyone else, those independent, at such a disadvantage that even if they were not a violation of Section 7, looking at these things independently, the total effect would most surely be a substantial lessening of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.239" offset="13332355">And all we have to show is that it may substantially lessen competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3672.336" offset="14792704">Now, everyone knows that Texarkana is within the general shopping range of -- of another larger city in Texas, just as they know that the (Inaudible) is within the larger shopping center of Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.468" offset="14845262">So that if you take all these figures for a very small political unit, as the Government tries to do, ignoring the fact that it's right next to a very large metropolitan area, you can get some terrific distortions as they do in these appendices that they put in their reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.398" offset="14909001">In their appendices, they rely on the 1958 census which were not available till 1961 and were not introduced into evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="4033.218" offset="16236231">I used the term “sales on consignment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.396" offset="16252949">I should not have used that term because I find that title actually passes in the sales to those dealers on the Wohl plan account.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.982" offset="16299342">On the question of this increase of Kinney -- of Brown sales to Wohl after it acquired Wohl, I like to say that most of the acquisitions prior to Wohl were very minor and in many instances were caused by debts or some cases bankruptcy and where the manufacturing plants were taken over with request of Chambers of Commerce or labor people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.052" offset="16415535">But on page 185 of our main brief, second full paragraph, I point out that Wohl's purchasers from its outside shoe suppliers other than Brown have risen from 20,900,000 in 1951, and 23,886,000 in 1957 so that Wohl's purchasers from its outside shoe suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.850" offset="16534758">Several years later replaces much as its shoe purchasers from Brown and it's during this same period, Wohl's purchasers from outsiders increased from 160 to 167.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.725" offset="16594317">One further fact and that is that Kinney purchases most of its shoes in as very low price range for the sale in its price range.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.322" offset="16652622">And the Wohl however, in these leased departments, sells not only in the medium grade fields but in the, some cases, the higher grade fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.224" offset="16704240">Although it's very minimal, Mr. Justice Stewart, it could be even about 4% of the sales of men's shoes in the leased departments, it possibly could be that some of them might be selling in the same price range as Regal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.479" offset="16753246">I think it would be minimal but it might be possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.879" offset="16790862">From the total number of outlets, 70,000, all shoes, Kinney and -- and Brown combined would only be 0.91% of these total 70,000 outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.139" offset="16867976">There were no witnesses who testified as to any possibility of their being -- their sales to Kinney being displaced by Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.677" offset="16906115">The sole and only witness, there was only one is in Government's Exhibit 251.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.426" offset="16929102">That question was not asked by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.014" offset="16939447">And there isn't testimony of any witness or of any implication, incidence of any such testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.225" offset="16972257">I just, again, to put Kinney into perspective, its sales and retail were 41,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.333" offset="17000678">Now, it is in this lower the price field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.765" offset="17014471">But the serious sales at retail were 104,000,000. Edison Brothers, all women's, 87,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.799" offset="17054595">Kinney was 85,000,000 and there's testimony that the famous bar store was the largest -- with eleven departments, the largest retail outlet west of the Mississippi River, and the Montgomery Ward was 41,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.394" offset="17112900">All of these are larger than Kinney's.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.074" offset="17135679">The court, seemed to us, erred in using the substantive measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.427" offset="17165040">As the Court knows this was not used by Judge Higgs (ph) in the American Crystal Sugar case or the Transamerica case or by the Federal Trade Commission in the Pillsbury case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.347" offset="17216763">It answered one question, Mr. Justice Whittaker, on these wholesale sales of Wohl -- 75% of Wohl's wholesale sales are made to dealers who are not on the Wohl Plan or were not on the Wohl Plan and 25% are made to those on the Wohl Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.709" offset="17322193">I would like to call the Court's attention in conclusion to our reply brief in answer to these appendices of the Government and to the fact that we believed that these appendices include what are wholesale sales to the independent dealers and the retail sales of those same dealers and to what they're trying to -- therefore the numerators and the denominators are in inconsistent basis and they're trying to compare apples and bananas with oranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.188" offset="17448103">In conclusion, may it please the Court, we submit that there was complete failure to analyze the evidence on the part of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.333" offset="17484675">The Government has accepted the fact that there was no substantial lessening of competition in manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.863" offset="17510797">And we believe that our briefs and the evidence will conclusively show that there was no substantial lessening of competition in the retail field or in the manufacturing and retail field combined.</text>

            <text syncTime="4442.225" offset="17872227">It is perfectly true and what the court said as to the purpose of that Section at page 558 of 279 U.S. United States, California.</text>
