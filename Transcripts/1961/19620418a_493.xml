            <label>Mr. Louis F. Oberdorfer</label>
            <text syncTime="17.359" offset="172805">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.838" offset="194748">This case involves the application of Section 7421 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code which provides very simply and very sharply that no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.717" offset="310209">The question precisely here is whether in the face of the statute, the District Court had jurisdiction to restrain as it did restrain the director of Internal Revenue from the collection from the taxpayer of a duly assessed social security and unemployment compensation tax, actually the tax for several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.651" offset="450017">On account of services according to the theory of the assessment, rendered by captains and crews operating shrimp boats owned or leased by the taxpayers, that is they either own them or lease them from a related partnership and then made available by a legal relation which is in dispute to the captains and crews to operate them and fish from them in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.650" offset="613961">The case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.996" offset="643323">That Court by a vote of two to one with Judge Reeves' dissenting affirmed the judgment of the District Court which had entered the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.109" offset="711764">The injunction had been entered after a protracted hearing on the merits the -- the final injunction had been preceded by a preliminary injunction and a restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.803" offset="774562">The issue between the director and the taxpayer arose by or initially and at the administrative level by an assessment made by the District Director through appropriate agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.580" offset="853661">The District Director examined the taxpayer's books, had discussions with taxpayer's officers, and according to the record, investigated by interrogating captains and crews in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.458" offset="933177">After having made this determination that the tax was due, the taxpayer filed a claim through the administrative review process to abate the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.738" offset="994304">This claim for abatement was considered and the order of the -- or -- or letter of the Appellate Division refusing to abate the taxes in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.769" offset="1034428">The order recites that the information offered by the taxpayers in support of his claim from abatement was considered and was respectfully -- the claim was respectfully denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.503" offset="1097435">Within a very short time, four or five days after receipt of the letter of determination denying the claim for abatement, the taxpayer, and this was before there had been any notice or demand which is a condition predicate to seizure and restraint, before any notice of demand, before any collection action had occurred insofar as the record shows, so far as we know, before any collection action had been attempted, the taxpayer filed a complaint for an injunction and for preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.358" offset="1268799">The District -- the District Court granted a preliminary injunction that it was pending before the motion for restraining order, the United States attorney was authorized to go into our practice not to either agree or disagree to the entering or entry of restraining order until we could find the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.028" offset="1371512">In any event, the Court had a preliminary injunction also without -- at that point without really hearing -- hearing any evidence or having made the -- any findings that the action of the director in making this assessment were arbitrary and capricious or otherwise susceptible to an equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.321" offset="1472658">This assessment was run -- the -- the -- the case came on for hearing and issue was joined as raised in the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.450" offset="1521142">The complaint had alleged that the taxpayer would be put out of business by collection of the tax and alleged essentially that the tax was illegal because the individuals with respect to whom social security and withholding tax -- social security and unemployment compensation tax was being paid or not as a matter of law employees and the case was tried and the record shows -- the case was tried on two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.291" offset="1660531">The -- the legal issue of whether or not as a matter of law, these employees were employees, the Government contending.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.665" offset="1702013">First of all, the taxpayer contending that because there was -- that because the -- the so-called employees were compensated on a share basis instead of being paid regular wages when the ship -- when the boat came in, the catch was sold and the proceeds of the catch were divided amongst the captain and the crew and the owner of the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.317" offset="1796681">And this, according to the taxpayer, distinguished the relationship between the boat owner and the crews and captain from the relationship of employer-employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.140" offset="1851956">The Government of course contended that although the method of compensation was unique in a sense that it was traditional to this industry, it was ultimately the kind of compensation which Congress had intended, would be subject to the social security and unemployment compensation tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.839" offset="1942758">If the Court please, we're -- we're not here to -- to debate the merits of whether or not these crews and captains were or were not employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.203" offset="2008168">We are here to contend and we hope satisfy the Court that this legal issue of whether or not these particular individuals were employees or were joint venturers or were lessees, whatever, was an issue that shouldn't -- wherever it should've been tried out, should not have been tried out in an injunction proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.332" offset="2132720">The -- there is a procedure for the payment of a tax and a suit for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.039" offset="2163545">This is the procedure contemplated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.636" offset="2181935">There is if -- if that procedure is not available, it seems to us that it's fair to say that Congress intended that the -- the matter be disposed of administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.596" offset="2241808">The administrative process is there, it's in the absence of a showing that it is unfair, that procedural shortcuts have been taken, that there has been discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.544" offset="2297501">It's the Government's position that Congress intended that the -- that matters like this be disposed off either administratively or in a suit for refund.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Oberdorfer</label>
            <text syncTime="648.018" offset="2695398">It's involved -- it is involved ultimately in this sense only, Mr. Justice Brenan.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.685" offset="2734164">We think that it's possible and -- to dispose of this case and to reverse the decision of the court below on the ground that irrespective of whether ultimately it is resolved as a matter fact in law that these individuals are employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.170" offset="2836041">The court below did not have jurisdiction to hear that issue in this proceeding, that is a proceeding initiated by a complaint in equity praying for an injunction against the Director of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.308" offset="2908557">As regards the -- the ruling, Mr. Justice Harlan, this was a ruling with respect to the liability of the owners of fishing schooners operating not for shrimp but for fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.358" offset="2980760">The essence of the issue was whether the share basis of compensation which is -- is not unique in the fishing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.976" offset="3019316">It may not be universal but it is certainly not unique where the employees and the owners were compensated by dividing up the proceeds of the catch in a manner of share profits whether people in that capacity were employees for purposes of this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.399" offset="3092982">And in 1940, the Internal Revenue Service Rule that there was that -- that where -- even though the compensation was -- by -- on a share basis, the crews and captains were nevertheless employees of the shipowners.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.101" offset="3171767">I -- I hasten to point out that the service in this ruling satisfied itself that there was the control necessary to the employer-employee relationship by looking to a contract which ran from the crews and captains to a labor union and from the owners to a labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.900" offset="3270928">That particular fact or that particular evidence of control is not necessarily that I don't think is in this case, we have what we -- we thought we had other evidence of the control necessary to create an employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.045" offset="3355564">But if -- if -- if I understand your question correctly sir, the answer is that at least since 1940, the Internal Revenue Service has asserted and collected tax from both owners who operate them substantially in the same way that these boats are operated that is on a share basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.739" offset="3462353">In addition to that, we now have a number of cases pending on suits for refund all through the gulf coast where taxpayers have paid this tax, having been assessed and have sued for it's refund and I might point out that those are very -- those -- those refund suits are being very hotly contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.787" offset="3566529">Many of them are being tried before juries and as the Court may notice from our brief, we won one of those cases in January or a series of those cases in the District Court in Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.734" offset="3646360">The question that -- that -- in this case Mr. Justice Clark, we think that the -- that neither the taxpayer nor the Government was as imaginative as it might have been in -- in figuring out a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.324" offset="3716681">Of course, if a -- an assessment for a taxable period is beyond the means of the taxpayer, his only remedy is to submit to distraint and then sue to -- for a refund of the proceeds of the res -- of the distraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.411" offset="3813021">However, in this particular case and with respect to unemployment compensation and social security particularly, we suggest in our brief and -- and we venture to suggest as a possibility although it's not precisely before us that in a situation where a taxpayer would be driven to the wall by an assessment and collection of everything he owns that he could conceivably pay less than all of the assessments for all of the taxable periods to the extent of his reasonability to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.429" offset="3985115">And without violating the rules established by this Court in the Flora case with respect to the income tax then sue for a refund without the Court being asked of jurisdiction, in other words, we think that a District Court could entertain a refund claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.177" offset="5368038">The court below found in that case authority for its decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.110" offset="5391862">And the Nut Margarine case was one in which an excise tax was assessed against the taxpayer, an excise tax aimed at oleomargarine made from animal or from some other sources, was assessed against this taxpayer because on the account of his product, made from peanut butter and peanut products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.932" offset="5519130">The issue had been litigated by other taxpayers over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.159" offset="5547969">The Government had lost at least three cases in the courts and won none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.563" offset="5577644">The Treasury Department had published a ruling, a published ruling that a product like the taxpayer's product was not taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.259" offset="5616410">The department had gone on and issued a specific ruling to this taxpayer that he wouldn't be taxable if he'd gone ahead and produced, and he had produced this product in reliance on that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.425" offset="5673044">After he'd run out his inventory, the Government came back on him for a very heavy excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.009" offset="5719437">He claimed that this issue was already decided against the Government that it was in effect pure discrimination against him as distinguished from his competitors to make the claim of this tax against him particularly when it acted so heavily in reliance on the Government's concessions that he wasn't taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.038" offset="5835525">They -- he also alleged and the Court there accepted his allegation that if this tax was paid by him in this circumstances, he would be put out of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.964" offset="5947225">A similar issue about -- that is an issue about the meaning of what -- of what has now said in 421, was before this Court in Allen against Regents of Georgia and in that case concurring opinions by Justices Reed and Black, suggest that they too have doubts -- had doubts that time about the Nut Margarine opinion but even assuming that Nut Margarine -- that Nut Margarine case stakes out an exception to the -- to the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.793" offset="6114513">We think that this Williams case is clearly distinguishable among other reasons because there is just -- there was no complaint in the pleadings and there was no basis proved at the hearing for a claim that the Government or the tax authorities had acted discriminatorily with respect to this taxpayer or had taxed him when they weren't taxing other people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.758" offset="6606451">We feel that the vital facts in this case at this point are that Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Company did not owe a tax in the amount of $41,000 which was assessed against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.009" offset="6679385">That is a finding of fact which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals which Justice -- Judge Reeves did not touch upon in his dissent, his dissent is confined to procedural problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.916" offset="6723062">And that it is binding upon the Government on this appeal and therefore it should be accepted as a fact that Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Company was assessed with a tax which he did not owe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.905" offset="6766947">The Government characterizes that tax at this point as erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.524" offset="6781471">We think that it was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.543" offset="6789517">But as whether it was erroneous or illegal, we think that that is merely a quibble and semantics that it was a tax which was not owed by our client.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.529" offset="6841448">No sir that is not because I'll proceed to the next point and that is an equitable consideration which was considered by the Court in the Miller case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.794" offset="6874572">And that is that the payment of the assessment would have wrecked and ruin the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.716" offset="6898186">Now, we were not complaining in the lower court that the payment of social security taxes on men in the future would ruin our business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.560" offset="6941654">We did not say that to the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.053" offset="6947610">We said that the assessment is so large and the corporation that this time is a deficit corporation that we simply cannot pay the full amount in order to sue and have a determination of the liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.635" offset="7001945">And therefore, the Court should give us the equitable consideration of enjoining the attempted or the prospective assessment in collection of this tax and permit us to litigate the liability per se without having to pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.037" offset="7063489">We say sir that the remedy -- the only remedy in such taxes as this, provided by Congress and we're in agreement with this, with the Government on this, that you must pay the full amount, file a claim for refund and sue to get it back in order to have the liability per se litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.057" offset="7135587">Except for the fact that we think that Miller stands for an exception where the payment of the assessment would be ruinous on the plaintiff or the respondent or the perspective taxpayer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.802" offset="7406529">But the Government does not develop in that argue -- that statement in its argument of the case and in no way do I see, I asked this Court to reverse this case on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.996" offset="7447385">We say with respect to that sir, that while the Government says that perhaps we were not as imaginative as we should have been nor were they perhaps as imaginative as they should have been.</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.944" offset="7959176">That is the antitrust case which the Chief Justice commented on a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.679" offset="7978088">In that case, it was incumbent upon the Government to prove that the men were not the employees or the packers to whom they sold their product.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.037" offset="8031483">The Government was successful in its prosecution of the union before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.870" offset="8046843">The jury determined as a matter of fact on the instructions from the lower court that the captains and members of the crew were not employees at the persons to whom they sold their product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.604" offset="8093759">Now, that occurred in the neighborhood where this case occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.428" offset="8109119">This case and at no doubt, the Court can understand if the antitrust case generated considerable interest in the packing industry in and about Biloxi where this case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.057" offset="8147571">And that was the position taken by the Government which was direct -- directly contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.442" offset="8497089">We have a respondent which conceded now by the Government does not owe a $41,000 tax, did not owe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.505" offset="8529377">The fact showed it, the District Court found it, the Court of Appeals had found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.950" offset="8547140">Secondly, the tax, we have a finding of fact by the lower court which is not urged to be reversed before this Court that the payment of the assessment of $41,000 would have wrecked and ruined the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.675" offset="8606072">Third, we have inconsistent actions taken on the part of the Government with respect to the relationship which as I said is the crux of the matter in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.923" offset="8647032">Those things were considered in Miller to be material to -- for a showing other request for equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.037" offset="8687470">We have this and further, the Government says if they take -- they took the position that they would consent to the issuance of a temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.700" offset="8722160">The complaint in this case doesn't pray for temporary restraining order, it prayed for preliminary injunction and the Government, we take the position, consented to the issuance of this temporary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.103" offset="8775764">Now, the Government takes position in their brief that this procedure places the orderly collection of taxes in jeopardy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2235.151" offset="9043989">I would say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.124" offset="9051826">I have obtained the Fifth Circuit's record in the Miller case to find out just what went on in the lower court in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.879" offset="9086934">I don't know what the record before this Court contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.349" offset="9100727">It may have contained less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.750" offset="9110340">But the Miller case presented a rather lengthy bill of complaint in which these cases which the Government had lost are set forth and they're copied (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.758" offset="9146389">They're just --- the decision and the opinions are written out in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.982" offset="9167287">And in the Miller case, the lower court considered the -- whether or not the bill stated the cause of action and said that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.471" offset="9197275">In the Miller case, the Government took the position and denied that the particular nut product was not manufactured in the way which the complainant said it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.989" offset="9243355">And so we had an issue of fact after the court determined that the complaint stated a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.831" offset="9262686">The court took proof on an issue of fact, the issues of the evidence being run, how the product was manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.111" offset="9295809">The ingredients that went into the product, was it churned with milk or was it churned with butter?</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.469" offset="9325275">Why was it wrapped in one pound cartons and divided into quarter pound sticks?</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.280" offset="9348472">Was it not sold, as a matter of fact, sold as a substitute for butter?</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.694" offset="9366131">These were factual issues which I contend were closely and hotly litigated in Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.198" offset="9392149">And the court -- the lower court determined those issues against the Government and found that as a matter of fact, the product was not taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.849" offset="9434781">Now, the statements with respect to whether the issuance of the tax or the -- levy of the tax in Miller was arbitrary, capricious and so on, I submit, are made from the vantage point of hindsight by the Court of Appeals and by the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.989" offset="9515342">There is no evidence in the Miller case that we there dealt with a vengeful collector who is out to break the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.902" offset="9550973">There is no evidence that he was acting completely at bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.607" offset="9569782">And what this Court said in the Miller case was "that the assessment was illegal," and then went on to say, "And to apply these additives, it was so illegal as to appear to be arbitrary and capricious."</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.736" offset="9622340">As I understand the Government's position in this case, our case should fail because the assessment does not appear affirmatively to be arbitrary, capricious or proceed from a sentence to motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.876" offset="9670928">And our answer to that is the majority opinion in Allen versus Regents case decided subsequent to the Miller case in which this Court passed upon the procedural -- two things, passed upon the procedural right of the Regents of Georgia to attack the validity of an assessment through the injunctive route.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.158" offset="9771969">And the second point was whether or not that subject tax was a burden on a governmental function of the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.865" offset="9806869">And in that case, the Regents won in the court below and when it came to this Court, these two things were passed upon, the Government urged first of all, in the Regents that we should not reach the question of whether the tax was a burden on a governmental function, because the lower court did not have jurisdiction to entertain this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.782" offset="9902477">We shouldn't even reach that, which they are doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.917" offset="9911045">They are arguing that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.578" offset="9921703">This Court held that it was proper, under the unusual circumstances existed in that case to proceed the -- by the injunctive route and then went on the whole that the tax was not a burden on a governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.309" offset="9996622">So we submit to the Court that reading Miller together with Allen versus Board of Regents, that this was a proper procedure given the unusual circumstances which we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.436" offset="10049076">But that's not all, a ruinous tax consent by the Government to this procedure try inconsistent proceedings taken by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.363" offset="10108844">No clear adequate remedy at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.891" offset="10134967">We state the question a little differently at this point, as whether financial ruin is the only alternative open to the respondent against to which the Government assessed to threaten to collect a tax which it did not owe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.074" offset="10195675">The Government and we recognize that the taxes keep this country going that they should be paid and we should follow order -- normally follow the statutory routes open to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.600" offset="10265788">The Government agrees with us, I believe, and does not now urge that Miller be reversed, but the Government agrees that Miller is an exception to the no injunction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.499" offset="10301419">We had another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.339" offset="10304763">We had Allen versus Board of Regents as another exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.455" offset="10321168">And we say this, that while Congress has not provided a clear adequate remedy in cases such as this for us to proceed without the payment of the full tax equity, the conscious of the sovereign will not permit an unconscionable wrong to be done and we submit that it would have been an unconscionable wrong for the District Court to dismiss this case at the threshold and not even reach the ultimate fact of whether or not our client owed the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.573" offset="10461706">We submit that within the equitable con -- jurisprudence that the lower court had the right to accept this case, take it into the bosom of the Court particularly when the Government consented to this route, determine the ultimate facts, decide it whether or not we owed the tax and permanently enjoined the Government, not withstanding the no injunction statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2615.111" offset="10563793">Wouldn't it be a rather late restriction on 7421 (a) that -- that any taxpayer could go into Court to merely claim that this tax was illegally assessed and that it would bankrupt him if he had -- had to pay it and then be entitled to a preliminary injunction to prevent the commissioner from collecting it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.009" offset="10683434">I think it -- I agree with the Court that it would and it has been attempted many times and in some cases, particularly social security case -- cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.399" offset="10720946">The court has done this, the lower courts have entertained jurisdiction to determine if in truth and fact what this taxpayer says is true, will it wreck and ruin him?</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.231" offset="10756263">Does he owe it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.199" offset="10764204">Now so, I think that it is -- unless Congress wants to do otherwise, the Congress can trust to the judiciary that it's going to act for the betterment of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.875" offset="10818853">It's going to follow the law, the Court will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.859" offset="10826794">But the courts should have this escape that they will not commit an unconscionable wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.611" offset="10845811">Now, I don't see where, as the court stated the question to me, whether there is any great danger to the collection for the revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.566" offset="10885622">I believe that if Congress considers that that's the danger in social security and unemployment taxes, Congress may give us a remedy to pay less than the full amount in cases such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.032" offset="10939538">In some cases that have come to this Court, in excised tax cases, I don't know if it comes to this Court, but the taxpayers only paid $50 in order to litigate the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.332" offset="10972662">We would have had to pay $41,000 when the assets of the company taken at best for only $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.532" offset="11001501">We submit its an unusual circumstance and that is the controlling facts, unless the other questions are (Inaudible).</text>
