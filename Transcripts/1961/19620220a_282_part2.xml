            <text syncTime="9.581" offset="141667">May I first answer some questions before recess, Mr. Justice Black, you asked me to point to that provision in the contract, if you will turn to page 151 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="23.870" offset="198823">151 (a) sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.339" offset="208750">You will find there a provision, extra labor to be charged for an actual cost plus 10% and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.121" offset="247829">Now, if the extra work was required to be performed, I say that the Stevedore could and would and should have charged Ellerman for that service under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.781" offset="306448">The question is whether it shall be the stevedore who shall determine what is necessary to be done to do this work properly, or whether it shall be the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.882" offset="362872">There has been much mentioned here this morning of the function of Mr. Quinn who was the vessels officer, a mate that you will find when you review the record here, that Quinn disclaimed expertise as a stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.958" offset="439254">He had never done the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.875" offset="446882">He did not purport to be an expert in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.979" offset="471333">He is an expert in certain fields but that is the whole division of labor if you will in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.484" offset="505292">That the shipowner, once his ship arrives in port, engages an expert contractor who undertakes to do all of the work required in connection with the discharging of that vessel, and of course this Court has said to do it properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.520" offset="565478">Now, this is not a new argument because in our brief, we point out the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.681" offset="590137">And this Court can verify it by looking at the original record in the case of Joseph versus Carter and Weekes Stevedoring Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.082" offset="631724">They were two cases back about 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.145" offset="643950">They're cited in the brief, in which the stevedoring industry was attempting to be exculpated from a locally imposed taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.646" offset="685955">The same, almost identical stevedoring contracts were introduced by the stevedoring industry there.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.023" offset="719496">They had two representatives pioneering for the industry in a test case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.738" offset="742275">And they there argued that the contract very, very similar to the one before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.368" offset="784802">And if I may interpolate something there, Mr. Marshall said that this contract was prepared by the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.033" offset="815522">That is not my understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.947" offset="823150">My understanding is the converse, but I do point out to the Court that there is no evidence one way or the other and no assumption I think just can be made one way or the other as to who prepared this document.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.918" offset="875081">But I do want to point out that this Court heard argument from the stevedores 15 years ago, that this contract which they undertook placed them an entire charge of and made them a part of the transportation process, and that this was their job to do the entire work.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.451" offset="973197">And that's no more than this Court has said that they shall do and do properly in the line of cases commencing with Ryan and the last one of which is the Waterman case.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.505" offset="1053341">The state -- the City of New York was not permitted to tax them.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.801" offset="1066611">And that was their argument there under these same contracts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Byrne, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="247.798" offset="1094614">It depends upon the interpretation of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.043" offset="1107571">In other words, whether they do actually takeover, perform and control that the performance of the unloading operation, or whether they shall be under the direction and control of some ships officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.089" offset="1175698">They're arguing here, Mr. Chief Justice that a ships mate should direct the intimate detailed method of work which this expert stevedoring company shall perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.703" offset="1234213">They are arguing here, for example, that if this ledge that was created during the discharging operation, which was submitted to the jury as to whether it should have been moved out of the way, they are arguing that they should not make that decision that some ships officer who is not an expert stevedore, who can't possibly oversee the work going on, being done in five separate holes of a ship, down low in the bowels of the ship, can't possibly see all this.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.447" offset="1357197">They are arguing that the ship's officer owes the expert stevedore this obligation, to tell him whether he should use a hook, or whether he should put a net, or a cargo trail that what is called a pallet in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.803" offset="1430549">They are telling -- they are arguing that this is a duty which the costumer having hired the expert to perform the job must direct at its parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.624" offset="1481853">And we say that this Court's decisions beginning with Ryan have properly interpreted the respective duties of these two parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.202" offset="1520201">And we say that this is nothing more nor less than the interpretation of these contracts of the industry itself urged 15 years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.298" offset="1612570">And under this contract, who would have determined how -- how that -- how it was to be handled in order to unload the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.257" offset="1652381">Would it -- would it just be up to the -- to the stevedore to do whatever was necessary and -- and accept more responsibility for it or would it be the responsibility of the ship to tell him what they should do with the New York cargo?</text>

            <text syncTime="409.389" offset="1740884">Now, I want to make one thing clear as a matter of practice with a common carrier and if you -- we have cited certain authoritative works in the field outside law books.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.436" offset="1801070">You do not load properly a cargo in layers, you low -- you put it in forward section after section.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.478" offset="1837328">That is necessary by the trade in which the common carrier is engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.648" offset="1857912">He has a number of ports of call.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.864" offset="1870869">He must in loading his ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.142" offset="1879960">He cannot load everything in -- in one port on the bottom and at the next port on top because of the mere factual -- what do I want to say, the -- the facts of the business itself because you cannot say if you are loading cargo in Calcutta first for example and then you were going to proceed westward to other ports that you are then going to discharge that cargo in a particular rotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.755" offset="2010363">You may have to discharge the cargo loaded at the second port before you discharge cargo loaded at the first port, so that you do not cover it up as a matter of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.484" offset="2049337">And most -- more important, no one has said so but the lawyers here and the authorities will bear out what I have just said, and there is no evidence in the case on the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.058" offset="2195623">There is some slight reference to it in the petition for certiorari which was denied in number 284.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.904" offset="2363016">But I was just wondering if that was the fact that in many places throughout the world, seaman do unload the ship if that wouldn't in it of itself make them also experts in -- insofar as unloading ships are concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.499" offset="2585370">And the members of the crew did not as a rule, have anything to do with cargo operations and I think that the -- the inconsistency of so stating is demonstrated by the references that this Court has made to the -- as I recall it, use the well-known propensities of seamen when it extended the doctrine of maintenance and cure in Standard Oil Company versus the name escapes me --- Jones and Waterman, there were two cases Jones versus Waterman.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.560" offset="3437589">Now, you are necessarily going to create a ledge if you unload one, before you unload the other, now that's perfectly true.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.246" offset="3516374">And I'm saying to this Court that there is not a scintilla of evidence in this record that that method of what is known as a split hatch is improper, per se dangerous, or that there's anything else wrong with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.782" offset="3582516">Now the District Judge did submit to the jury a question of whether Ellerman was negligent in failing to order the stevedore to move out of the way the bales under the opening which formed that ledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.446" offset="3661197">Now, I say, in our position I would say it probably depends upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.493" offset="3685334">I say sir, that if that was a dangerous condition which was gradually developing as the work progressed so that someone should have done something about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.498" offset="3805393">Now, I think where the Stevedore's argument leaves it on this point is that in addition to employing contractor A, Atlantic and Gulf to unload this cargo, we should also have engaged another and separate independent cargo expert, stevedoring company to make the place safe for Atlantic and Gulf and prevent Atlantic and Gulf from creating a condition which was unsafe, which unsafe condition did not exist when the work started.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.434" offset="4029106">You see, the Stevedore can breach a duty which it as a contractor owes to its costumer in more ways than creating an unsafe condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.914" offset="4079052">If, for example, its method of performance brings into play an unsafe condition and that was the factual situation before this Court in the Crumady versus Fisser case in which I believe Mr. Justice Douglas wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.718" offset="4154284">And there used the phrase that the stevedore must indemnify the shipowner, in other words has breached his contract with the shipowner if the way in which he works brings an unsafe condition into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.641" offset="4213948">There is a Circuit Court of Appeals decision cited, a American President Line versus -- it's a Ninth Circuit case where the -- there was a hatch which had a defective -- I'm sorry a hatch beam which had a defective lock on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.415" offset="4285001">The defect was called to the attention of the stevedore by the ship's officer.He did -- he nevertheless did nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.013" offset="4315408">And during the course of the unloading operation, somebody bumped the beam and because it had no lock, it dropped and injured someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.290" offset="4344560">Now, the courts always have said that where you so perform that you bring into play a dangerous condition of which you as an expert must know it's dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.432" offset="4401089">Now, I do not speak of the latent unsafe condition, a latent defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.151" offset="4423973">But it -- surely if anyone should recognized what is unsafe, so far as a discharging operation on board a ship is concerned, it should be the stevedore, the expert in this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.203" offset="4480188">And all that the Court of Appeals has done here is to say, “Plaintiff recovered against Ellerman upon one of three theories because that's all that the District Court in its charged submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.649" offset="4553958">And upon each one of those three theories if Ellerman was negligent, then as a matter of law, that constituted a breach of the Stevedore's contract and the stevedore having breached it should indemnify Ellerman for the damages caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.902" offset="4630967">Now, true it is that in the District Court level, the Ellerman of unseaworthiness was submitted to the jury, the Ellerman of unseaworthiness being whether or not the package which this -- this banding around the bales should or should not have broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.891" offset="4702960">And the Court of Appeals said, “We do not decide this case on the basis,” because that involves an extension of the doctrine of seaworthiness from the ship to someone's cargo and you are then imposing liability upon shipowner who is a common carrier for the packaging around cargo and the courts and the doctrine have not gone that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.816" offset="4798673">This is a negligence case said the Court of Appeals and we will so regard it that if it is a negligence case, and then indemnity follows as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.327" offset="6416697">I would like to take up that last question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.191" offset="6424116">Mr. Byrne just said the jury could but didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.292" offset="6436551">The specific answer in Your Honor's question is that when the jury answered the question, did the fault of Ellerman arise out of any failure on the part of Atlantic and Gulf to do its work in accordance for its contractual obligation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.452" offset="6481168">The jury said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.670" offset="6490049">And Mr. Byrne by his answer creates the impression what the jury found against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.364" offset="6508857">That is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.979" offset="6515336">The jury specifically found that we did not breach our contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.883" offset="6530905">Now, I would like to assert, if Your Honors please, there won't be any misinterpretation as to Philadelphia lawyers in their practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.345" offset="6564760">In the first place, Mr. Byrne was handed a copy of my motion to dismiss and a copy of my motion for a directed verdict which specifically set forth the reasons and support thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.077" offset="6619721">And if Your Honors would be kind enough to look at the docket entries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.763" offset="6642395">At page 3 (a), there is entered in your official record, third-party defendant's motion to dismiss and motion for a directed verdict file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.828" offset="6690670">If Your Honors would be kind enough to look at page 186 (a), Mr. Borowsky, attorney for the plaintiff says, “Your Honor, may I have exceptions where we have asked for a directed verdict?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.489" offset="6753364">We're in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.719" offset="6762245">Rule 50 (b) says, “As a prerequisite to a judgment N.O.V. you must file a motion for a directed verdict setting forth specifically the reasons therefore.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.831" offset="6802683">And for a very good reason, this calls the judge -- the trial judge to attention so that he can decide whether or not he could submit the issues to the jury and still reserve judgment on a formal motion for judgment and it will be filed within 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.228" offset="6876244">We follow ended here to that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.874" offset="6890872">Mr. Byrne tried this case if Your Honors please with no reference really to the third-party defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.103" offset="6919816">All that he has said here is there was no evidence that we did anything wrong, there was no evidence that we did this, there was no evidence that the stow was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.564" offset="6957641">This has already been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.025" offset="6967463">Mr. Byrne filed a motion for judgment N.O.V. as to the plaintiff's case and it was considered fully and lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.917" offset="6991078">The Circuit Court affirmed and your honorable Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.016" offset="7011453">Now, if in fact there was evidence on which the jury could find negligence against the shipowner, that's already foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.759" offset="7042382">The verdict's been paid, as it's suggested by Mr. Byrne in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.788" offset="7062549">Now, so there won't be any further mis -- misapprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.545" offset="7073520">Mr. Byrne created the impression that we sort of trapped him last Friday with a replied brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.556" offset="7097553">Well of course we have to file a reply brief, if Your Honor please, when Mr. Byrne submits a brief to Your Honors and two-thirds of which comes under this heading appropriate motions under Rule 50 (b) having been made to the res -- by the respondent, the legal questions were preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.364" offset="7176861">We submit as we do in our reply brief, this Court may very well -- not even considerable as two-thirds of this brief, and we had a further reason for calling this to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.206" offset="7224195">Mr. Byrne was gracious enough to stand up here this morning, tell Your Honor for 20 minutes that he really filed a point for binding instructions which under the badge case in the Third Circuit decided in 1960 says, “You cannot file a point for binding instructions, mixed up with a lot of other points and expect the court to treat it as a motion for directed verdict where you got to set forth the specifics.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.925" offset="7323042">Now, Mr. Byrne in his brief told Your Honors at page 3, the respondent here complies with all of the requirements of R -- F.R.C.P. 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.290" offset="7372570">It moved for a directed verdict in its favor upon its cause of action for indemnity against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.272" offset="7400469">And to examine to the legal ques -- examination legal question does preserved is not arguably a violation of the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.452" offset="7433174">If Your Honors please, he raised the 50 (b) issue and not us and in aid of this Court, we called it to Your Honors attention because I think you would want to call to your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.898" offset="7474970">And may I say further, if Your Honor please, at page 28 of this record -- of the respondent's brief, he says, “The petitioner ignores completely the fact that the jury's answer in interrogatory, asking the jury to determine whether respondents fall to rose out of any failure on the part of Atlantic and Gulf” was predicated upon a charge which instructed to the jury and then he quotes half of page 29, “If there is any liability which respondent owe to the plaintiff, that condition was created by Atlantic, that is your criteria.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.458" offset="7613210">Mr. Byrne did not paraphrase that quote by saying as the Court did, Ellerman argues to you that if there was any liability, he submits it to this Court as though this was an absolute charge by the judge when in fact all he did was to quote Mr. Byrne's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.803" offset="7694608">I say if Your Honors please, this issue is whether or not a court and a jury having properly decided the case after a 10-day trial under a full charge, whether or not the Circuit Court could pick one of three possibilities, one of three possibilities and say the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.383" offset="7796903">And I'm now quoting for -- from the Court's opinion on page 227.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.214" offset="7816234">Now, bear in mind, there were four issues of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.320" offset="7828668">The Court said, “If it was negligence on Ellerman's part, if it was to permit Beard to work in an unsafe place, it was equally negligent for Atlantic to handle the cargo in charge created an unsafe place.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.845" offset="7898781">Now, I say to Your Honors, just as I -- I don't know which of the four grounds.I say to this Court -- this honorable Court that Judge Kalodner has no right to select one of four grounds and say, “If it was this, Atlantic isn't -- is obliged to pay indemnity.”</text>
