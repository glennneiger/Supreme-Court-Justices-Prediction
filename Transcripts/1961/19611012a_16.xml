            <text syncTime="32.844" offset="234768">The facts briefly in the Roper case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.027" offset="255457">In 1954, the Government stored some of its grain, surplus grain in the James River fleet anchorage aboard that liberty ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.883" offset="310941">The ships were inactivated and were acting as storage facilities for the Government's grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.793" offset="350542">In 1956, the Government sold some of its grain to the -- the Commodity Credit Corporation, sold some of its grain to the Continental Grain Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.052" offset="407594">As follow this transaction, the Government paid the Continental Grain Company fees for the unloading of its vessel at the Norfolk grain pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.592" offset="453778">The Harry Lane was one of these vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.309" offset="468616">It was then decided to unload this vessel at the Norfolk grain pier and the Harry Lane was towed from the James River fleet anchorage down to James River through navigable waters of the Chesapeake Bay to the port of Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.516" offset="553462">The universal modern method of discharging grain and in fact loading grain is the use of equipment known as the “marine leg” or “grain shoot”.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.783" offset="602467">This is automatic equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.123" offset="611871">The vessel is brought up to the pier and this equipment is lowered over into the holes of the vessel and there is an endless belt that goes up this grain shoot.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.554" offset="673625">And if it is unloading the vessel, it sucks this grain up into the warehouse and -- which is over here on the side of the pier.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney H. Kelsey</label>
            <text syncTime="162.602" offset="753768">This equipment -- at the end of this equipment is what is known as the “detachable scoop” or “plow”.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.117" offset="783862">In other words, it is conceivable that when this grain shoot gets to the bottom of the hole that it cannot get the rest of the grain from the four corners of the hole up, so they have a scoop there at the end of this grain shoot and which is detachable and the man detaches this scoop and there is machinery which holds this scoop towards the mouth of the leg and he walks as if he were plowing, pushing the grain to the mouth of the leg and it is sucked up into the storage through the leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.107" offset="931819">That simply is the method of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.150" offset="943940">Now, longshoreman Roper was an employee of Atlantic and Gulf Stevedores which is a stevedoring company engaged solely in stevedoring work.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.302" offset="992632">The owner of the vessel, Harry Lane, which is the Government, sold its grain to the Continental Grain Company which owns the storage facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.349" offset="1036727">And the Continental Grain Company in turn got the services of Atlantic and Gulf Stevedoring Company to do the unloading and Roper was the employee of the Atlantic Stevedoring Company longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.320" offset="1100675">He went aboard the vessel and when he was injured, he was attempting to show others in the hole of the vessel how the -- the plow should operate and pushing towards this block.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.655" offset="1162010">What happened was there are wheels on the end of this scoop, at the mouth of this scoop around which lines go to this scoop and in pulling the machinery, in pulling this scoop towards the mouth due to a defective block or actually due to a defective strap on the block, this thing broke and it slipped off and hit Roper in his face as he was walking on the bottom of the hole or pushing the grain towards the shoot.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.969" offset="1323238">We filed our case and the suits in Admiralty Act and proceeded on through proving and alleged in the unseaworthiness of the vessel in line with Sieracki and all of the others who came along the latest (Inaudible) the Crumady of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.062" offset="1399620">The District Court held in that instance that the vessel did not owe the warranty of seaworthiness to longshoreman Roper because the court held that the vessel was not in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.908" offset="1467016">Although she was performing everything that a live ship was doing, she was discharged in her cargo pursuant to a commercial venture by her owner, the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney H. Kelsey</label>
            <text syncTime="363.886" offset="1558967">Yes, they told her by a means of a tag from the James of anchorage to Norfolk, it does spread 20 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.888" offset="1590941">And aboard this vessel, the Government put a master with licenses unlimited and six crewmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.178" offset="1620093">The Government calls him a riding to this still seaman in our ample opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.656" offset="1642036">However, the master of the vessel, admitted in his testimony that he had complete charge of the vessel during the unloading operation and in fact he even stated that if the stevedores had attempted to do anything unsafe that he would have stop the unloading operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.283" offset="1724479">The District Court, however, said that this vessel was not in navigation and consequently, according to the decision of this Court in West v. United States that no warranty was owed to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.960" offset="1779231">The circuit -- Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court with Chief -- Chief Judge Sobeloff dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.741" offset="1814340">Chief Judge Sobeloff pointed out in his dissent that this was not “dead ship” that -- that the West decision of this Court in 1959 was improbably apply to the factual situation here of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.258" offset="1888423">Pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.818" offset="1890617">And the West case, this Court held that a vessel which -- whose owner had by a consent given the vessel to the shipyard for a complete overhaul and repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.514" offset="1945475">And it was taken to shipyard and the shore-based worker who came aboard the vessel to -- to make it seaworthy and was entered as the result thereby that the vessel owner did not owe the warranty of seaworthiness because the vessel was -- with there -- was out of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.926" offset="2027081">It is our position in this field, in this case, that the Fourth Circuit, the majority in the Fourth Circuit misapply, totally misapply the West decision to the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.869" offset="2094895">Indeed, this Court pointed out in West that the Sieracki doctrine holding that the warranty of seaworthiness extends to shore-based workers who are performing the traditional duties of seamen, held that in the West decision that that was not applicable because the vessel was out of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.899" offset="2190921">Now, our position here is just as the District Court said, while this -- the District Court had its opinion said, “This is no “dead ship”.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.292" offset="2240554">She's a live ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.721" offset="2246301">She's doing everything a live ship does and sitting in navigable waters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="541.095" offset="2267721">We come therefore to the principle question here as I would see it --</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney H. Kelsey</label>
            <text syncTime="649.773" offset="2702503">Now, I don't -- I don't see that there is too much -- I think Judge -- Chief Judge Sobeloff pointed out in his dissent the fact that this was a vessel doing everything that any other vessel does and that is the completion of -- completing a voyage on a commercial venture for her owner and was doing -- and was unloading its cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.176" offset="2804067">And Roper, my client, was doing what traditionally a seaman does.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.130" offset="2827891">And as the Court held in Sieracki then this person is entitled to the benefit of the warranty of seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.275" offset="2860492">The other point in the case was the claim that since this machinery was -- was attached to the dock that -- which was performing the thing, the unloading operation that the -- that watches if seaworthiness did not cover such machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.774" offset="2954428">But this Court stated in West versus United States, Mr. Justice Clark writing the opinion for a unanimous court that the emphasis now should be upon the focus -- the focus should be upon the status of the vessel is it in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.584" offset="3029661">In West, here you had a vessel in the shipyard pulled up on the ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.609" offset="3049827">The man was injured making unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.179" offset="3060067">And in the Roper case, you've got a vessel performing a live function.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.531" offset="3077517">So, we look to the status of the vessel to determine if that vessel is seaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.940" offset="3099146">And if it is determined that it is seaworthy, then, of course -- pardon me, in navigation, if it's determined it is navigation, then the Sieracki doctrine, Pope and Talbot v. Hawn, Crumady and all of the rest of the decisions, magnificent decisions of this Court holding that this man is entitled to the warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.657" offset="3197994">But the West decision says also this as we take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.109" offset="3215757">Mr. Justice Clark said in West.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.671" offset="3226102">We don't believe that there should be any job analysis for this people.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.427" offset="3245119">They show a basic people that come aboard and perform seamen's duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.498" offset="3265390">My point with this Court is that by analogy, if -- if West held that there should be no job analysis neither should there be a gear and equipment analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.448" offset="3573112">What difference does it make?</text>
            <text syncTime="804.945" offset="3573008">Isn't -- isn't it really immaterial that one handle this equipment should be on a dock, it is doing the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.695" offset="3572903">The unloading operation which a longshoreman would be doing with a shovel in the hole or standing on the dock and shoveling the grain into a pile on the dock, we see no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.381" offset="3572799">And what difference would it make also between that and the line which is attached to the dock?</text>
            <text syncTime="832.961" offset="3572694">So we think that the emphasis since West had shifted, the emphasis had shifted to the status not only to the vessel but the status of the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.470" offset="3572590">And if the equipment is being used in a practical and reasonable relationship to the maritime service to the vessel, why should this Court or any other court go into any analysis of the type of equipment?</text>
            <text syncTime="859.263" offset="3572485">Is it grain unloading equipment?</text>
            <text syncTime="861.793" offset="3572381">Is it a dolly that you have?</text>
            <text syncTime="864.471" offset="3572276">Is it a -- a block and tackle?</text>
            <text syncTime="869.231" offset="3580322">As we do, the Petterson decision also, the earlier decision of this Court, in which this Court said, “It makes no difference who owns that equipment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="878.332" offset="3616684">If that equipment is brought aboard, the vessel and its used to the maritime service of the vessel, the Ninth Circuit held in that case and it was affirmed by this Court that the warranty was owed to Petterson was injured as a result thereby.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.045" offset="3687528">So, our view is that the majority in the Fourth Circuit below was clearly and plainly wrong in misapplying the doctrine of the West decision to the Roper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.208" offset="3744162">And we do not believe that the -- the equipment analysis to the fact that it is attached to the dock makes any difference whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.118" offset="3787839">It's suggested in the Government's brief, they have said -- some have said examples perhaps of rendering a principle -- reduce it to absurdity about -- (Inaudible) running along the dock and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.732" offset="3858265">But through all of the decisions of this Court and Sieracki are as on the clear reasoning that if the equipment is being used in a practical and reasonable relationship to the maritime service to the vessel, then it should be covered and its immaterial works on the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.856" offset="3938826">And in fact, Congress, pardon me, Congress has passed the extension of Admiralty Act in Title 46 Section 740 which has held that admiralty jurisdiction extends to the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.421" offset="3993057">Well, if it extends to the dock, a longshoreman on the dock, their cases -- the (Inaudible) case and others which hold that it does extend there.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.509" offset="4029419">My time is up.</text>
