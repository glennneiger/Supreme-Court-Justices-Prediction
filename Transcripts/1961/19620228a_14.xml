            <text syncTime="18.766" offset="178448">Upon adjournment yesterday afternoon, I have words about to pass to another phase of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.293" offset="200495">That is to say, I do not dispute the fact that this Court can always determine the finality of a state court judgment and the determination of the finality of a state court judgment as a matter for this Court to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.904" offset="250964">So, our Texas practice will not control, of course and I so hope can see, with Your Honors' permission I'll now pass on to the -- the matters involved in this lawsuit as -- if it reaches the merits, the Court reaches the merits of the consideration of this suit originated with Mr. Langdeau as the receiver appointed of an insolvent insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.130" offset="335914">He was appointed a receiver under our Liquidation Code or under our Insurance Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.169" offset="360051">This is a lawsuit that was brought under the provisions of a particular Texas statute which says in substance and it is quoted in our brief “that the Court of competent jurisdiction of the county in which delinquency proceedings are pending, under this Act shall have venue to hear and determine all actions and proceedings et cetera instituted by the receiver”.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.435" offset="445106">That is followed by another provision of the code which says a court, unless the same clearly appears to the contrary from the text, means that court in which the delinquency proceedings are pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.129" offset="491917">Now, I say to you, Your Honor, that this is the type of a case that the Supreme Court mentioned and had in mind when they brought upon the decision in Casey against Adams.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.858" offset="1266813">There, if I may say so, was a case wherein a bank in New Orleans had timely claimed their privilege to be sued in New Orleans, but the land upon which the lawsuit was predicated to clear the title to it was situated in another phrase, a similar -- a similar to a county in the State of Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.678" offset="1402128">And that Section 5136, that's the predecessor of the present Section 24, subjects the banks to suits at law or in equity as fully as natural persons, and we see nowhere in the banking act any evidence on the part of the Congress to exempt banks from the ordinary rules affecting the locality of actions found at all local claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.366" offset="1964805">And he brought it against many individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.752" offset="1974418">Let me say to Your Honors that while this case has not yet been tried, this case precedes against the banks on the theory of a conspiracy on so-called year-end transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.645" offset="2017991">For instance and I now call Your Honors attention to page 180 and 100 and -- wait a minute, it is 169 of the -- of the record, as an illustration on what we are called upon here to establish upon the trial of this Court is on a transaction, for instance, that occurred on December 31 of 1953, the insurance company promoters and their operators being desires and of decorating their year-end statement borrowed $400,000 from the Republic Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.363" offset="2152782">Taking a security therefore, a box sealed up with an affidavit on it that it contains $584,000 worth of premium load.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.024" offset="2191444">They purported to buy $400,000 worth of bonds on the 31st of December.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.823" offset="2214640">They earmark those bonds and on January 2, reappropriated those bonds to their own accounts, canceled out the note and collected some few dollars in interest on $88.88 interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.554" offset="2261556">Now, we have a conspiracy charge out of proposition that they were bolstering, that the banks directly participate or it is in the scheme to defraud the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.849" offset="2298755">Now we have, in a conspiracy action generally and touch as it is elsewhere where a person joins a conspiracy already in existence and/or he participates in that conspiracy and where you get, you then can choose your form.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.883" offset="2350895">We chose a form here because it was a statutory choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.780" offset="2366464">We now have a situation wherein a conspiracy action such as I have demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.766" offset="2386422">That's only one of them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Quentin Keith</label>
            <text syncTime="574.778" offset="2402513">By that is to say the Insurance Code which created this man's title the “statutory liquidator”, said under our Texas practice that new lawsuits shall be -- be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction where the delinquency proceedings are pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.058" offset="2459564">The delinquency proceedings which are not challenged were brought in Travis County that has receipt of Government in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.352" offset="2488822">The -- that is the court of competent jurisdiction having custody of the property of the defunct insurance company, one of the assets which is this lawsuit, seeking to recoup the money that the -- the debtors and the stockholders and the -- the unfortunate creditors of this company were defrauded of.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.079" offset="2567711">So we say to Your Honors that this is a suit somewhat lacked the Florida case had in the Okeechobee case wherein -- I grant you again that that is a state court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.746" offset="2614314">It is not binding and may be not even persuasive upon this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.232" offset="2632286">But the Okeechobee case was a situation wherein a -- two banks in Florida had contracted with a county whereby that they were going to deposit certain securities to secure county of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.626" offset="2685889">One of the banks was located in Jacksonville and another one was located, I believe, in Lake County.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.256" offset="2708355">But in any event in two separate counties, there was a tripartite arrangement there.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.062" offset="2727581">The Florida Court considered the statute which we have involved here and said in substance that if -- if, and my I quote for just a moment from that, “The suit could not be maintained against the one under the allegation of this bill of complaint without the other being joined in that suit under the Florida National Bank of Jacksonville may not be sued upon its joint contract in Okeechobee County and the People's Bank of Okeechobee County cannot be sued on its joint contract in Duval County then there is no jurisdiction in which a complainant may maintain its suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.898" offset="2866970">We're not quite in that position here because granted that we can try a conspiracy case in two different forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.467" offset="2893197">But Your Honors well know that the difficulty appended upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.408" offset="2908975">If you try one set of co-conspirator as one place, it is the other fellow that is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.228" offset="2928306">If you try them together, it's the only place a successful conspiracy suit can ever be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.070" offset="2955682">Now, if the Court please, I know I violated one of the Court's rules so we're going to split the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.461" offset="6829223">But when we pass on -- when that charter to that bank expired and it was recreated during the war of 1812.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.992" offset="6855346">And the Osborn case came up subsequently in the early 1820's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.292" offset="6872586">That particular provision of the charter had been modified to say that state courts of competent jurisdiction and the Federal Circuit Courts would have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.559" offset="6921592">And Chief Justice Marshall in the Osborn case held to the Court in that particular instance had jurisdiction and quotes the new language in the second national bank charter and sustained it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.702" offset="6986167">Now, that charter expired during the Jackson Administration and there were no national banks until the National Banking Act of 1863.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.403" offset="7041024">Since Chief Justice Marshall, we might not then viewing it from this 1960 have the same view but since he had placed significance on the mentioning of the federal courts by name, I say that it was a natural thing to do for the author of the bill in 1863 to have said the same thing in which in 1863, they did with no mention of state courts at that time, but where the extra language for the first time may be sued in the district in which they are located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.612" offset="7213850">In 1864, that whole National Banking Act was repealed and a new one passed which included state courts and had the reference to the county and in the city in which the suits were filed, which I say, it was an attempt to grant affirmatively, not a restriction but an affirmative grant growing out of the history in the Deveaux and the Osborn cases and not an attempt to restrict it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.869" offset="7322833">As a matter of fact, Chief Justice Marshall himself in the Osborn's case has this to say about the Deveaux case, whether this decision be right or wrong, he had rejected in the Deveaux case, this language that it could be sue or be sued in any court of record, whether this decision be right or wrong, it amounts only to a declaration that a general capacity of the bank to sue without mentioning the courts of the United States may not give a right to sue in those courts.There -- it -- with that language, there is no -- there's -- it -- it seems to me to follow plainly that the offer of the banks of the Act in 1863 and 1864, thought it necessary to mention the courts and that it was attempt to grant jurisdiction which were in reality this other language was amply brought to have permitted such suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.928" offset="7587088">And if I may, in the -- this Supreme Court subsequently speaking through Mr. Justice Bradley said that the result of the Deveaux case was to leave the banks open to be sued entirely and only in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.372" offset="7668903">And that case is cited in our brief and Mr. -- Mr. Bradley's language is quoted there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.541" offset="7693563">He says that the result of the Deveaux case was not to leave the banks where they couldn't sue or be sued in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.516" offset="7721462">But it left them solely to be sued and sue in state courts because the language of the act of Congress that says that they can sue and be sued in any court of record and that is in substance still a part of the National Banking Act to this day is broad enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.756" offset="7798366">And there's no reason on Earth as we look -- as we view it now why that shouldn't be interpreted to give them broad powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.195" offset="7832116">And if this other Act is an attempt to grant affirmatively power and not a restriction where you have another part of the statute that grants broader authority, then I say that it's not controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.208" offset="7900244">And if -- if we examine the terms of the statute, it doesn't say, may only be brought in the county where -- where the bank is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.678" offset="7942040">It doesn't say shall be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.199" offset="7952175">It doesn't say must be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.753" offset="7962415">It says maybe brought, which would indicate that the author means that he thinks he is granting something and that if he doesn't grant more, there is no more wherein in fact as a part of the banking -- Banking Act in 1863 and to the present day is this provision that they can be sued in any court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3099.222" offset="12500302">If Your Honors please, I would like to go back first and elaborate a little on the nature of this case purely from the pleading standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.048" offset="12551607">There was no evidence introduced below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.627" offset="12561847">It was all agreed and it's all a matter of record these pleas of privilege controverting affidavit in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.848" offset="12598732">So any statements made by counsel outside of the pleadings are, of course, not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.436" offset="12645125">They went a little far, went to Brazil out of the record that I don't think that'll be -- it would be necessary for me to go out of the record and I only intend to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.913" offset="12703013">The plea -- the petition shows that this is a suit, and I say this deliberately and not in -- with any malicious thought that this is a monstrosity, this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.153" offset="12771976">And I want to tell you what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.999" offset="12783365">It's 144 defendants that this -- that this receiver is sued allover Texas in the United States and some in England and which the general theme running throughout this complaint is this, “That this ICT Insurance Company was organized in 1950”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.216" offset="12880227">They said when it was organized, it was insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.999" offset="12903320">That at all times from 1950 to 1957, when it was put in to receivership and a state liquidator for insurance companies took it over, that it was insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.500" offset="12969357">That all of these people that had dealings with it over this period of seven years, know -- knew that it was insolvent and that their transactions with this insurance company were made with the ulterior motive and purpose of keeping it head above water, so to speak so that it could continue to commit frauds on stockholders, policyholders and the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.654" offset="13101955">That puts these two banks in the position of -- of dealing with an insurance company under the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.469" offset="13145213">That it knew to be insolvent, lending it money from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.230" offset="13168306">And they do ordinary course of the banking business, knowing that it was insolvent, not lending it the money as a pure banking transaction to get interest on the money but to keep this broke insurance company alive so it could commit vast frauds on -- on the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.473" offset="13261302">Now, with 144 defendants in the case and each one conspiring with each other, I ask an actuary to tell me just how many conspiracies that would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.038" offset="13343535">And he came up with an astronomical figure that was greater than Mr. Glen's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.954" offset="13371225">It was 22 with six figures behind it and then trillion, trillion, trillion conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.564" offset="13413648">Now, we are asked to -- these two banks are subpoenaed to come down to Austin, Texas to bring their attorney with them, to bring an officer with them, to bring their records with them and sit there throughout that kind of a trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="4013.382" offset="16156923">It would still be the very same record and the very same situation that this final question on venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.013" offset="16187434">Now venue, in this case, has nothing whatever to do with the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.935" offset="16211153">And you go into the merits, it's -- they're not going to mention the -- the venue has nothing whatever to do with the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.132" offset="16247933">So, it is on this question that involves the federal right of these banks to be sued in the county of their locale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.620" offset="16305821">It's the sole question here before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.588" offset="16321703">And it's a valuable right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.721" offset="16330271">And the Supreme Court of Texas has -- has held in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.800" offset="16346572">I won't look for the opinion to quote it exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.247" offset="16360364">But they held that this question of venue was once exclusively within the area of jurisdiction so to speak or -- or this exclusive decision of -- of the Texas Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.215" offset="16420237">And that the -- that this question and we are insulated from the Supreme Court of the United States with respect to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.190" offset="16464123">Well, if we -- if we are, then this statute is repealed by judicial legislation and there's no relief that can -- can come to -- to an injured party that has the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.108" offset="16523786">Now, Mr. Justice Frankfurter was asking yesterday if we would go over the state court decisions that were cited for adversaries in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.731" offset="16590346">And I don't have much time but I -- I have just a few more minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.228" offset="16620335">And I'll -- I'll attempt to -- they're distinguishable, had great of them are.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.724" offset="16650219">The Austin Court of Civil Appeals made a statement in -- in a very brief language what they involved and that is -- that court's notation was -- was correct about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.703" offset="16722213">It said this, that their decisions involved one, only usury cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.759" offset="16750425">Well now, the -- the usury case distinction has been repudiated in Leonardi versus Chase National in the Second Cir -- Circuit with this Court denying certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.728" offset="16798281">They said they were applicable only in transitory cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.645" offset="16817925">And three, that it is permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.921" offset="16831091">Well, this Court can determine as well as the state court whether it's permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.100" offset="16851780">But some of them held it was permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.435" offset="16861080">Then they held that it was repealed in Section 1348 supra.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.666" offset="16886053">Now, in the International Refugee case by the Southern District of New York in 1949, they answered that -- that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.132" offset="16923878">And it also is -- was answered in the Buffum case, decided contrary in the Buffum case in which this Court denied certiorari as to whether or not that was repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.037" offset="16991483">Now, the -- the fifth distinction was a single New Jersey Court in the Cassatt case wherein the -- the court there in New Jersey said, “We're inclined to think that the direct application of the statute is jurisdic -- as -- is to jurisdiction and that it is not in such potent control of venue as to be imperative in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.069" offset="17095659">So that's the -- that's the way those cases fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.095" offset="17111751">Now, there are several of them, I have notes here on what each one holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.380" offset="17132857">And now, I won't have time to go over it, but I'll say this, that they -- they don't sustain our adversaries in the way that they say they do because at least two of them in there hold that it's mandatory to the cases they cite, hold that it's mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.328" offset="17220733">And then there were some waiver cases in there where they have waived it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.813" offset="17250617">And then there was one where they claim they we're stopped to -- to assert it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.208" offset="17272247">So, those -- those cases don't -- don't help them as much as they would like for them to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.817" offset="17314670">For example, this Iowa case that they cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.357" offset="17328776">That was a state law fixing super headed liability of a stockholder of a state bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.793" offset="17354585">And the national bank apparently was one of the stockholders and has held there that it was a local action statute created the cause of action, it was not a common law liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.031" offset="17403486">And as to -- as to our case -- whether or not it's a local action, I don't think it could be any question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.222" offset="17440266">And I -- I would think that this Court can certainly pass on that -- that question because as Mr. Justice Frankfurter mentioned, if a state legislature can make a local action out of any kind of action that it sees fit to then it can effectively repeal the force and effect of this venue statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.903" offset="17554996">If Casey versus Adams is the -- is the -- the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.076" offset="17579656">Thank you very much.</text>
