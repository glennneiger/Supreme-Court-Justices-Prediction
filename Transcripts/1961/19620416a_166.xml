            <text syncTime="25.714" offset="206242">We are here on a -- an appeal taken from the order of the Minnesota Supreme Court which affirmed an injunction issued by the court below that restrained peaceful picketing on the part of the petitioners involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.854" offset="310836">The petitioners are the National Marine Engineers Beneficial Association and an affiliated Local 101 both being unincorporated labor unions admitting into membership marine engineers who work on the self-propelled vessels under American flag on the deep sea, Great Lakes, the rivers and the inland harbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.719" offset="438209">The respondent here or respondents namely two, the Interlake Steamship Company and the Pickands Mather, one is the owner and the other is the operating agent of a fleet of vessels on the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.605" offset="513755">They happened to be the second largest operator of vessels on the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.885" offset="534862">A dispute arose between the petitioners on the one hand and the respondents on the other with respect to the organizing or recognition of the marine engineers of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.159" offset="595989">It has been found below and there is no dispute that the Marine Engineers of the respondents are what is termed "supervisors" as defined under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.615" offset="657847">However, as a result of this dispute, the petitioners established a picket line on a date namely November 12, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.626" offset="709883">The picket line was established at the dock of a secondary employer namely the Colorado Fuel and Coal Company or Coal and Fuel Company at which place a vessel of the respondents was then placed unloading its cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.875" offset="794833">Also, a picket line was established either the same or the next day at the plant of another secondary employer namely Interlake Iron Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.323" offset="840704">When the picket line was established at both these places with respect to the first, it has been found below that the employees of the secondary employer refused to work, ceased working and as a result, has been found below, the Colorado Fuel and -- Fuel Company was not able to continue working as it was supposed to on the ship for the respondents.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Pressman</label>
            <text syncTime="256.695" offset="1130141">Before the lower court, a first a restraining order was issued and then after hearing, the restraining order was merged into a temporary injunction and finally into a permanent injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.104" offset="1191790">Below, in the court below, it was found and the court made its findings to the effect that what I've just recited had occurred namely the picketing at the premises of the secondary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.533" offset="1253543">And though the petitioners urged that in the face of those facts, activity had been presented which could reasonably or arguably be held to fall within the purview of certain positions of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.075" offset="1323656">That contention was dismissed and the court issued its orders, holding in effect that by virtue of the picketing at the premises of the secondary employer and compelling the secondary employer to cease doing its business, it had the purpose of forcing the respondents to recognize this union and to enter into a collective bargaining contract, the contents of which would have been in violation of Minnesota statutes and Minnesota public policy and the orders were issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.852" offset="1470777">The orders were directed specifically among other things at ceased the picketing and ceasing, having the picketing ceased at the premises of the secondary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.786" offset="1522500">The simple question that we've submit is involved in this appeal is whether where you have a union which -- as we will demonstrate, is primarily, not exclusively but primarily, composed of what is known as "supervisors" engaging in activity where the dispute is admittedly over a group of employees or workers of the primary employer who are supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.118" offset="1655829">But where the activity involves the employees of a secondary employer as in this case is that kind of a situation reasonably or arguably within the purview of a provision of the National Labor Relations Act and therefore preempted for the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.129" offset="1747884">The specfi -- the specific provision of the statute to which we have reference is what is known as Section 8 (b) (4) (A), commonly referred to as the secondary boycott provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.048" offset="1803577">I'd like to pause for a moment and point out that at the time this dispute arose, the provision of the secondary boycott provision was so designated as Section 8 (b) (4) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="438.251" offset="1856345">Subsequently, they were amendments to the National Labor Relations Act under what is commonly referred to as the Landrum-Griffin Act in which that provision became what is now known as Section 8 (b) (4) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="453.018" offset="1915486">For our purposes, the Amendment did not change the impact of the issue which we are raising.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.264" offset="1936384">I shall henceforth referred therefore to Section 8 (b) (4) (A) since that was the provision involved in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.240" offset="1972328">I wish to at this moment, call to the Court's attention the essence of Section 8 (b) (4) (A), the secondary boycott provision which is that where a labor organization, which is one necessary ingredient, induces or encourages the employees of another employer, what I call a secondary employer, to cease their work and the -- for the purpose of having the secondary employer cease his operations or his relationship with the primary employer, that is the essence of the offense under the secondary boycott provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.668" offset="2134079">I don't believe I need emphasize here the framework that has been established by this Court in three outstanding cases as to when do we have preemption in favor of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.666" offset="2194056">We have the Garner versus Teamsters case, the Weber and Anheuser-Busch case and the San Diego versus Garmon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.558" offset="2225612">They established the framework, which we submit for our purposes, has established preemption in our case, namely the simple test is whether the type of activity that has been presented may reasonably or arguably, not necessarily clearly but simply reasonably or arguably indicate that the activity is within the purview of either the permissible or protected activity of the Act or the prohibited activity of the Labor Act that then establishes preemption in favor of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.351" offset="2720789">I would submit yes because -- actually, may I say just to the outset, we have here I believe a very situation that I'm sure the Court had in mind in enunciating its Doctrine of Preemption, namely you will find in the case of MEBA versus National Labor Relations Board where the Board has held this very organization to be a labor organization for the purpose of the secondary boycott provision, the Section 8 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="683.975" offset="2839280">The Second Circuit upheld that order and stated that and held that MEBA, the very petitioner here, is a labor organization for purpose of Section 8 (b), the test being one that I will come to in a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.915" offset="3187022">I will state now what we have in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.546" offset="3197576">In the memorandum of law that a company -- the findings of fact on the restraining order and then was incorporated, this very memorandum law was incorporated in the amended findings of fact and further and finally incorporated by the court's own reference in the ultimate injunction order of a permanent character.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.629" offset="3281899">The memorandum law has this paragraph, which what we have here in the record, "The record in this case does not show that MEBA Local 101”, which is only one of the petitioners, “admits the membership any supervisory employee and in any event”, that the court went on to say, "it is clear that its membership is composed primarily and almost exclusively of supervisors."</text>
            <text syncTime="827.459" offset="3413243">The reason the court in that statement did not say exclusively or wholly is because the record also contains a statement of counsel for the petitioners in the court below in which statements have definitely was accepted into the record not as mere argument but as a statement of fact on behalf of the petitioners where counsel said that “most of the engineers are supervisory employees of the membership of the petitioners", using the word "most."</text>
            <text syncTime="864.078" offset="3559633">In the court below, there was also presented and accepted into the record a case that had been previously decided by the National Labor Relations Board ordering an election of marine engineers in which the organization involved was the predecessor of Local 101 so that the Board in holding that election necessarily was holding that those marine engineers were employees and not supervisors and they had been members of the -- the same organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.395" offset="3704978">That is all we have in the record, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.899" offset="3715009">Of course in the -- before the lower court, we had before the Court the Labor Board decision in the case involving the MEBA which subsequently became the subject of the order of the Court of Appeals in MEBA versus NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.062" offset="3779584">The appellate -- the Supreme Court of Minnesota had Judge Friendly's opinion in NLR -- in MEBA versus NLRB in which there, there was a final decision that this very organization was a labor organization within the purview of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.774" offset="3850428">Now, I must confess that I believe that in the court below, both the lower court and the higher court, there was considerable confusion as to the difference between what is involved on the Section 8 (a) and what is involved on the Section 8 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="957.867" offset="3934856">For example, in the courts below, we pointed out that we were -- we argue that in our belief we were -- this case was preempted and urged upon the court, a Minnesota Supreme Court case of Norris Green versus SIU.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.078" offset="4007685">Both courts dismissed that issue claiming that there they said, the employees or the workers of a primary employer were employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.403" offset="4048959">Whereas here they said, the workers of the primary employer are supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.419" offset="4065050">Therefore, the case is inevitable, completely in error on that -- on such conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.907" offset="4090964">When it came to the issue whether we were or were not a labor organization, I submit Your Honor that the courts below did not go into the issue whether we were a labor organization as interpreted by the NLRB, namely in our very case what the Labor Board has held, that if there are two employees in our organization, only two or more and its oddly immaterial, says the National Labor Relations Board, whether those two are the actually involved in the primary dispute, the courts said immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.938" offset="4231084">The fact that we have two workers who are employees, who are our members, makes us a labor organization and if we become involved in a dispute where the primary workers are supervisors but in the course of our dispute, we become involved inducing employees of a secondary employer, we are subjected to the prohibitions of Section 8 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1257.562" offset="5133667">I might suggest or submit that in a case called Masters, Mates and Pilots versus N.L.R.B cited in the brief of the respondents, the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia has remanded a similar case to the Board stating that in there judgment, they believe a substantial number should participate before making it a labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.502" offset="5217364">What the ultimate decision of the Labor Board will be or the courts in receiving appeals in that issue, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.890" offset="5246934">We have argued below in the federal cases and before the Board that on our humble judgment, a labor organization for purpose of 8 (b) in view of the fact that our members have been excluded from Section 7 and Section 8 (a) should be an organization which is primarily supervisors and if it is -- if it is that, it shouldn't be within the purview Section 8 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.740" offset="5342333">But we've been overruled by the Labor Board and the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.087" offset="5359679">So that we are now in a paradoxical position where before the Labor Board and the courts taking appeals from orders of the Board, we're held to be under the purview of Section 8 (b) and then we get in before state courts and the state courts simply disregarded the decisions of the NLRB and rule on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.124" offset="5439822">I believe you'll find that from the opinions of the lower court, the opinion of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, their whole thrust in determining whether we were a labor organization or not was that the primary employees involved here were supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.852" offset="5506800">And since they were excluded from the National Labor Relations Act, "certainly" said the courts, an injunction should be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.729" offset="5538252">It was is a curious notion in the courts below and then a part of counsel for the respondents that by uring the issue of preemption here as we are, that we're trying to evade the law and be in a no man's land where no one has jurisdiction over us, quite to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.166" offset="5604080">We're submitting that under the decisions of the NLRB and the decisions affirming there -- theirs that we're simply stating where within the purview of Section 8 (b) apparently and that the National Labor Relations Board first decide.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.279" offset="8896449">Suppose I'm wrong, my printed proposition as I hoped to develop is that assuming that this Local 101 did have this counsel argued two or three non-supervisor members but otherwise, its membership was -- are composed of supervisors and that we have here an activity directed to trying to compel an employer to recognize that role call as the bargaining agent for its admittedly supervisor personnel that would still not deprive the state courts of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.443" offset="9061125">Now, I'd like to just proceed to state my theory, I don't know whether the Court will agree, I hope they will but at least I -- I like to present it briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.300" offset="9108564">I'll start with the -- this proposition, the -- in 1947, the Congress in amending the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, undertook to exclude the area of labor relations between supervisors and their employers from the NLRA and from the jurisdiction of NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.697" offset="9234160">They did that in part by redefining employee and perhaps to some extent, employer and by defining of supervisor so that it would be certain what they meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.973" offset="9307303">Now, that -- if -- if the language could otherwise be subject to a different interpretation, I submit that this is a case in which the real legislative history, the reports of the Committees, of the Senate and the House and statement of the -- of the persons or the members of Congress in charge of the bill on their respective groups conclusively established that this was on -- the Congressional intent and that among other things, they regarded it as a highly important principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.743" offset="9478353">That -- the -- that -- neither that -- supervisors should not be permitted to engage in the regulatory federal scheme on behalf of employees and perhaps on behalf of employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.331" offset="9608652">Now -- and when -- before I go to the sentence of my argument, I mentioned another thing and that is Section 14 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.777" offset="9646477">Now in the original act, it's printed at page 41 of our brief in the appendix that dealt -- by preceded in the Act by the word limitations, now in other words, Congress put in as in -- as a limitation upon what it had done before with respect to amendments and specifically with respect to the exclusion of supervisors from the area of labor relations covered by the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.649" offset="9773955">Now, they started and they say, "Nothing herein so prohibit any individual as the supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization."</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.772" offset="9814497">To me that seemed unnecessary but it seems to me of this that they put therein and then says nothing herein, that's in these amendments shall be so construed to avoid the possibility that the existence of the amended Federal Act or the amendments themselves should be construed to prohibit supervisors from joining unions where they were permitted to do so under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.736" offset="9934346">Now prior of course to the Act of 1935, labor relations had been in general and as far as here con -- concerned exclusively regulated by the states and Congress was remitting this area of labor relations to state regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.694" offset="9998190">Now then however, they were so concerned about what they thought were the evil effects of the earlier act which had been construed in the Petrov case that they added but no employer that has nothing to do with the other -- of employer subject to this Act shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors, as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating two collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.805" offset="10110621">Now as -- any at all, that isn't this, this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.686" offset="10130160">Now I -- I think this was another cautionary move which they did not -- they'd -- they -- in which they wanted to make clear or to provide rather that while they were remitting to the State, the area of labor relations which is -- consist of those between supervisors and their employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.874" offset="10230888">They weren't -- were not to -- permitted to enact interstate law the rule of the Packard decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.207" offset="10268191">Now, our -- our position broadly is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.458" offset="10289194">The real question, I may state somewhat as following.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.607" offset="10313749">Did the Minnesota State Court have jurisdiction or the right to exercise jurisdiction in an area of labor relation which the Congress expressly excluded from the operation of the NL -- NLRA and from the jurisdiction of the NLRB where -- in order to enforce the statutes in public policy of the State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.824" offset="10474663">In other words, to enjoin a continuing violation of the state statutes and interstate public policy insofar as there was no limitation in both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.806" offset="10522624">Now, my contention is that, as I involved here, they plainly had that jurisdiction subject only to the limitation that they couldn't enact in interstate law the (Inaudible) decision which had lead Congress in large part to enact the amendments relating to the -- to supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.762" offset="10610395">Now, we come then to -- to the proposition, the contrary proposition which is edged by our Brother in -- on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.779" offset="10678523">I think we have to approach this matter from this standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.418" offset="10705063">At least in my view obviously if the 1904 decide to amend seven amendments, the Congress undertook to exclude the area of labor management relations here involved from the federal statute and from the jurisdiction of the Federal Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.514" offset="10785416">Now, when we come to -- if, and I am doubtful at that, if it were true that you could make a technical argument that some sections of the Act, NLRA applied to some sort of convict with -- in which a union of supervisors engaged, it would be unthinkable that call -- that this Court or any court would cease upon that technical and literal construction to defeat the clearer intention of the Congress which was to restore the regulation of this area of labor relations to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.201" offset="10984155">Now, as I think Mr. Pressman conceded and as Mr. Friendly's, well then passing, may I say before I -- I go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.986" offset="11031280">Without going into detail, in my opinion, the three decisions of this Court upon which petitioners principally rely have no applications whatever to the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.855" offset="11098781">So far as I know, this is the first case, state case in which the question has clearly been raised as to whether doctrines of federal preemptions or primary administrative jurisdiction bar the exercise of state power in a field of labor relations which the Congress has expressly excluded from federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.053" offset="11235558">In the case in which Mr. Pressman principally relied that is the decision in 274 F.2d 137, the court did nothing more than to hold that upon a basis of their sketchy record there presented, and under the principles laid down by this Court in the Universal ever -- ever -- Camera case it could not say that there was no basis for a finding or holding of the NLRB that in that particular case whatever part of MEBA was involved was a labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.991" offset="11423326">Now, the court went on and however it -- to say that we are not binding --</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.111" offset="11743796">That is the decision in 294 of F.2d relating to the emergency injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2943.446" offset="11877125">We held that on the facts there presented, the Board was justified in finding that non-supervisory employees participated in these two unions and hence, in holding them within that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.497" offset="11921324">Now, if Your Honor please, that case involved tugboats or towboats and barges on England Waters, as I think was suggested by or at least to -- raised by question of one of the justices that the States in between this large boat carry -- cargo carrying steamers on the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.906" offset="12010977">And these small barges and towboats and the like on England Waters is very great and in some of the NLRB decisions which are cited by petitioners, they stressed that and point out their completely different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.960" offset="12087254">Your Honor, we have -- I -- I recognize myself to this point one moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.004" offset="12123408">The only -- the basis of the -- of the -- of our plaintiff argument is, as I analyze it, first, that the jurisdiction of these courts were, state courts, could not be exercised because of doctrine of federal preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.278" offset="12208462">Now, I am not familiar with any decision of this Court which holds that where the Congress in undertaking to regulate part of a field has specifically excluded what another applied from federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.964" offset="12323192">Nevertheless, it has preempted the state courts from acting in that excluded field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.256" offset="12360391">It has always been the law for many years that the mere enactment of a federal statute stick -- to a federal statute did not oust the states of all the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.440" offset="12401142">Certainly, has been settled in without question that Congress may regulate a power but only a power of subject matter over which it could exercise exclusive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.326" offset="12448684">So, I -- I said can't be on that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.724" offset="12462268">Then it is on -- it has to be on the doctrine of primary administrative jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.640" offset="12489958">I submit that is -- is also unavailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.566" offset="12513677">First, I do not know their -- any decision of this Court that holds whereas here, the Congress has carved out part of the subject matter of a particular federal regulation and left it to the states that the question as to whether a particular case follows within the area of that subject matter cannot be decided by a state court or a Federal District Court in which the question is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.232" offset="12656306">But they must stay awake until this administrative agency makes a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.138" offset="12683891">Now here, there's nothing involved but questions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.504" offset="12701341">There's nothing inconceivably that could be suggested which is not within the con -- conventional experience of every justice on this bench, nothing of any of the reasons for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.722" offset="12754213">But I think the primary thing is that in the -- where the question is as to a -- a -- something falling within an area which Congress has expressly excluded from certain federal regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.222" offset="12920247">He states the claim that -- question as to whether a particular act was excluded from the federal statute which preserve precisely the same ground as did the question as to whether it was in interstate, I think, it was in interstate commerce for -- I think it was in in those days, I don't believe they went to affect this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.558" offset="13005615">And -- so I come briefly to this, I do not think that -- well on the first place, it is perfectly clear that Judge Friendly did not hold that a union of supervisors can avoid the state regulations, the field of Government in which the regulation is omitted -- remitted by taking in one or two non-supervisory members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.727" offset="13142288">But we come down to this unrealistic technical argument, the only argument -- so apparently it can be advanced that this union can be, if it has two non-supervisor members among 10,000 then the States cannot exercise their regulatory power and their courts cannot enjoin a continuing violation of the state statutes and state public policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3677.571" offset="14813706">There are just two or three very brief comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.446" offset="14821125">First, the case we've heard to by counsel for the respondents In re Kelleher for the case that arose that has -- I believe is completely in apposite in the sense, it did not in anyway raised the issue of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.303" offset="14876609">The issue came up under a state statute with respect to certain jurisdictional disputes between various unions but the issue of preemption is not involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.841" offset="14914748">Number two, I'd like to point out that Local 101 to which references has been made is not confined in its jurisdiction to the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.004" offset="14951424">The record indicates that Local 101 includes areas in the offshore and harbors activities, and as I stated, Local 101 is the successive union to the union involved in Graham Transportation case where an election was held by the National Labor Relations Board, therefore indicating they do have members who are employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.995" offset="15035329">Counsel for the respondents has pointed to finding number 2 on page 29 of the record as his only finding with respect to the status of the membership of the MEBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.356" offset="15084753">I indicate and wish to emphasize that that finding merely says that the defendant Local 101 admits to membership license marine engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.111" offset="15127803">There is no statement that that is the exclusive membership of Local 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.995" offset="15147342">And may I point out that the other petitioner in this case is the National MEBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.801" offset="15166568">Local 101 is only one of two petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.387" offset="15180884">Lastly, I wish to make this observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.788" offset="15194572">As far as the MEBA is concerned, we argued strenuously before the Labor Board and may I say to the Chief Justice, the NLRB did hold in this specific case, "We were a labor organization because we had a few members of the word non-supervisors."</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.906" offset="15263013">You'll find the actual quotation from the decision of the NLRB on page 11 of our brief where the Board says, "We conclude that some of the engineers whom MEBA admits into membership are not supervisors, and therefore that MEBA is a labor organization as defined in the Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.690" offset="15346082">The Labor Board so held and that was the case that Judge Friendly and the Court affirmed in the case which we have cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.626" offset="15373876">I'd make this last observation.</text>
