            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 304, Continental Ore Company, et al., Petitioner, versus Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation, et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.389" offset="144906">Mr. Alioto, you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_l_alioto" startTime="14.201" stopTime="270.611">
            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Alioto</label>
            <text syncTime="14.201" offset="160162">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, I want very briefly announce to refer to three of the points made yesterday by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.096" offset="195793">First, with respect to the offer of proof, that offer of proof related as you recall to the Canadian elimination and this to the elimination of the petitioner from the Canadian market.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.599" offset="241768">The shipments we were talking about in connection with that elimination were shipments which originated in New York City or in Long Island rather and were shipped from there to the Canadian border.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.103" offset="291819">We're talking about the American Commerce and we're talking about a conspiracy which had the situs in America, formed in America and executed in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.299" offset="328600">Now, in connection with the offer of proof, we submitted and that's being tag here, we submitted some 29 letters and these letters were exchanged of correspondence between the petitioners in this case and the Union Carbide Company and its wholly owned affiliate Electro Met at Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.356" offset="408848">With Electro Met at Canada, its wholly owned affiliate, its wholly owned subsidiaries as a matter of fact that was the agent for the Metals Controller of Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.865" offset="450853">Now, there isn't any question about the fact of the actual eliminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.758" offset="466422">There isn't any doubt that they were eliminated from that market and the only thing we're talking about is why they were eliminated from that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.427" offset="497037">When they were eliminated from the market and they have very substantial costumers in Canada, when they were eliminated from that market, their business was split between the two respondents, so it literally taken away from them and given to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.168" offset="564015">Their business was taken from them by Electro Met of Canada which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Union Carbide.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.157" offset="592018">When they complained about it under the offer of proof and then documents that we submitted in connection with that offer of proof which were marked for identification and which were excluded by the lower court, when they complained about it, they didn't go to Canada to complain about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.527" offset="645517">They went to New York City at the office of Union Carbide and they saw a man named Mr. Walker who was -- wrote to a man named Mr. Walker who was admittedly an authorized agent of Union Carbide.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.889" offset="690970">And they complained about the fact that they were excluded and that their business was divided between the two American companies who under the assumptions of the Court were engaged in this conspiracy to monopolize the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.066" offset="739662">Then the authorized agent under the offer of proof had another man named Arroway called the petitioners to talk about this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.481" offset="773308">Now, as this man named Arroway that Mr. Archer yesterday called the Court who made certain admissions, they were in jury as to the interest of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.832" offset="810715">But under our offer of proof, we offer to prove and it's explicit that Mr. Arroway far from being a clerk was the confidential agent of Union Carbide in connection with this international business that he was a liaison man of Union Carbide in connection with relations with the European cartels that he was an important man, a high-salaried man in the Union Carbide office, and specifically that Mr. Arroway was directed to contact petitioners by those who were admittedly authorized agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.150" offset="931924">Now, we submitted to Your Honor please of that offer of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.749" offset="942373">The Court please that offer of proof is sufficient, it clearly set out the issue and the trial court rejected it on the theory of the American Banana case and he wasn't going to get into the acts of Canada at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.083" offset="991692">When it got to the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals admitted was willing to assume that what was done in connection with eliminating these petitioners from the Canadian market was done for the very purpose of entrenching the monopoly which he was also assuming.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.630" offset="1057938">But he said that the Noerr case prevented him from giving any antitrust implications to this obvious elimination in the Canadian market.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.847" offset="1090748">We submit that the offer which is set out in pages 438 to 468 of the record so far as the actual correspondence is concerned and the full oral offer made before the Court at some length set out in pages 817 to 839 of the record that the offer is sufficient and its rejection and that alone justifies sending this case back for a retrial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Alioto</label>
            <text syncTime="273.875" offset="1198895">Yes, 438 to 468 Mr. Justice Harlan of the actual correspondence, 29 pages of correspondence that we have marked for identification offered in the evidence in connection with this offer of proof was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.428" offset="1257096">Then pages 817 to 839 of the oral offer made to Judge -- the late Judge Vaught in the trial court in which he rejected on the American Banana decision that this was a Canadian situation of the final act was performed by Canada even though we pointed out to him that we were talking about American shipments, the American conspiracies and then the action which obviously affect the United States exports.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.917" offset="1359078">So, we think it obviously sufficient.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="315.801" stopTime="335.798">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="315.801" offset="1366601">You said that alone were justify sending this case back to the District Court, wouldn't another way to deal with it, be to send it back if we -- if we assume that you're right on this issue and on this issue alone to send it back to the Court of Appeals?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_l_alioto" startTime="335.798" stopTime="374.885">
            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Alioto</label>
            <text syncTime="335.798" offset="1446536">The reason I think not, Justice Stewart, is because in the Court of Appeals admitted that this was one gap, it couldn't reach by its notion that there was no evidence of legal causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.813" offset="1498676">Other words, if they could -- if they could handle, if they could take cognizance of this under the Sherman Act, then admittedly there was direct causation, they stopped the shipment of these petitioners and took them out of the Canadian market because since that's the gap, he couldn't reach on the matter of legal causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.821" offset="1558653">And if the Court is satisfied that the lower court's theory of the -- based on the American Banana opinion was wrong, I see no reason why we can't go back for a trial and -- and I don't have to go back to the Court of Appeals.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="374.885" stopTime="379.060">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="374.885" offset="1602957">The Court of Appeals didn't deal with the American Banana contention I think.</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_l_alioto" startTime="379.060" stopTime="420.486">
            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Alioto</label>
            <text syncTime="379.060" offset="1619571">The Court of Appeals by implication rejected the American Banana contention because it said I am willing to assume that what was done in connection with the Canadian shipments was done to entrench the American monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.094" offset="1667741">So, while it didn't mention the American Banana opinion, it implicitly rejected it in that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.037" offset="1687489">But then went on to say that this Court's opinion in Noerr prevented it from doing anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.173" offset="1712044">The Court of Appeals endeavor on the contrary said that there was a manifest difference between instigating a government agent to inhibit commercial activities as against instigating a legislature to pass a law which has any competitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.934" offset="1775156">We submit that that distinction is valid.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="420.486" offset="1785292">That would mean if you take that theory -- assuming you lose on the rest of the case that will mean that the retrial be confined simply to the America -- to the Canadian exclusions so far?</text>

            <text syncTime="435.306" offset="1844642">No, if Your Honor -- if we lose on the matter causation, no it seems to me that if that much of it, if that much of it was caused by this monopolization that that would somehow affect the other operations of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.709" offset="1914232">The petitioner is the worldwide trading organization of considerable substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.055" offset="1931577">It was the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.176" offset="1940041">And they if it's found that the monopoly affected the petitioner's business at that extent, and then it seems to me that that inspects the entire record and all of the other activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.042" offset="1979538">The petitioner was basically engaged in exporting ferrovanadium and vanadium oxide in manufacturing under association's ferrovanadium in procuring a vanadium oxide source and so I don't think that we would be limited on retrial to just that issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.749" offset="2046412">I'm afraid I don't follow that because the premise of the Court of Appeals has been in this that the conspiracy monopolize that you assert is accepted as the premise.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_l_alioto" startTime="497.661" stopTime="499.226">
            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Alioto</label>
            <text syncTime="497.661" offset="2094059">That's correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="499.226" stopTime="525.161">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="499.226" offset="2100328">And it reversed because they said on the element of -- of causation on the living out Canadian business, you have proved the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.277" offset="2144528">I don't know if we should reverse on this Canadian business.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.652" offset="2158007">I don't see how that brings revivifies the causation -- your position on causation, assuming that we don't agree with you on that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_l_alioto" startTime="525.161" stopTime="612.770">
            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Alioto</label>
            <text syncTime="525.161" offset="2203982">If -- if our position on causation is -- if the Court of Appeals' opinion on causation is accepted totally for the five episodes or the five transactions which the Court of Appeals mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.743" offset="2254346">I assume that we would be out on that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.423" offset="2269080">But there is a great deal more on that record besides those five transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.396" offset="2284962">This was a general business which these petitioners have in vanadium oxide, vanadium ore and ferrovanadium, and there was a good deal more on that record than just those five transactions that the Court of Appeals looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.374" offset="2332818">So, I don't think in the light of that that the retrial I think it would be limited necessarily to just that one transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.415" offset="2361031">For example, these petitioners bought, when they were able to get the Government to foresee spokes to sell to them, these petitioners bought vanadium oxide at the fixed prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.266" offset="2404394">Now, the fixed prices were approximately 30 cents a pound above what they dealt with as between themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.723" offset="2430307">When they were dealing between themselves, they dealt at 30 cents below the price that they sold to these petitioners and submitted the evidence if that price was fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.016" offset="2463431">Now, that transaction for example would obviously be in a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.789" offset="2478477">But if Your Honor means where there's specific transactions found not to have been caused by the conspiracy, should the Court hold that there isn't any countervailing evidence in connection with the question of legal causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.090" offset="2527692">I assume that the Court approves that that we be barred from going into it.</text>

            <label>Justice Tom C. Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="612.770" offset="2554441">I thought you had yesterday some mention of instructions that you thought would require reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.116" offset="2591848">Well, that's -- that's correct Mr. Justice Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.994" offset="2607313">However, if this Court approves the decision of the Court of Appeals, it is to the effect that we should never have gotten to a jury on these things and that's how the Court of Appeals avoided meeting the issue of the obviously erroneous instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.655" offset="2673977">So --</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Alioto</label>
            <text syncTime="645.481" offset="2685262">We objected to the Klor instructions for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.348" offset="2696756">At the time we were arguing the instructions, the Klor case was midway between the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.685" offset="2726118">They gambled that this Court was going to affirm the Ninth Circuit, so they lost their gamble when this Court unanimously reversed on the Klor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.124" offset="2759868">So that's an obvious one.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.533" offset="2765511">And then the context of this case, there has some significance Mr. Justice Clark because the effect of the Klor decision giving the Klor instruction to this jury was to say to the jury that Union Carbide and VCA may with impunity directly intend to eliminate this petitioner and actually eliminate this petitioner so long as they themselves have enough left to serve the public generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.487" offset="2861328">That was the effect of the Klor's instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.193" offset="2868120">It went that far in the context of this case, so it's obviously erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.132" offset="2887868">When we ask the Court to give the Bigelow instruction, that's when the Court openly said that they proposed to stop reversing the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.692" offset="2914095">It didn't believe in the Bigelow instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.403" offset="2920991">It wouldn't give it and didn't give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.849" offset="2930813">Then the Court directly instructed that any acts that were done while Union Carbide or any of its agents were acting as government agents to purchase vanadium oxide were totally immunized by the antitrust laws, which we believed is also a mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.521" offset="2993507">Those three standout particularly, those three I think are rather obvious, but under the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that was never reached because it held that the motion to dismiss should have been granted on the ground that weren't -- didn't have sufficient evidence to prove causation.</text>

            <text syncTime="745.335" offset="3084727">They bought it at 80 cents, Your Honor please, we bought it a dollar 10 cents a pounds and they try to charge it at a dollar 15 cents a pound.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.432" offset="3109073">After a squabble, we're able to get down to a dollar and 10 cents a pound.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.393" offset="3120985">Now on that, we asked the lower court to instruct that we were entitled to recover under any circumstances the difference between those two prices or the difference between what we paid and what the market would have been in the essence of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.045" offset="3171558">The Court wouldn't even submit that issues to the jury even though it was in the record and clearly in the record, we made a serious point of it and that wasn't even taking cognizance by the Court of Appeals because it's obviously no question about causation there.</text>

            <text syncTime="787.937" offset="3255150">The lower court simply wouldn't instruct the jury on it, wouldn't even let the jury decide the issue and the Court of Appeals ignored it entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="863.172" offset="3556080">Now obviously, the OPA didn't fixed prices for -- for competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.778" offset="3574471">What happened was that the price fixing conspiracy under the evidence and under the acknowledgement of the Court of Appeals to place before the OPA was even passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.653" offset="3609997">And all the OPA did was to free that sealing, those conspiratorial prices which had been fixed by agreement, and they would fixed as simply -- as simply meeting in hotel rooms in fixing those prices, meeting in lunch rooms in fixing those prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.799" offset="3666526">Now yesterday, Mr. Justice Black asked one -- one of the counsels for respondents whether there was any claim by the petitioners that there was some evidence in the case other than the intention to eliminate these petitioners followed by the elimination of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.411" offset="3744998">And counsel answered that that's pretty much the contention being made there.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.319" offset="3756596">Well now of course, it's not the contention being made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.044" offset="3767568">What we are contending is that on the Story Parchment, under Eastman and under Bigelow, if there is the type of violation which has a tendency to inflict the harm which actually follows that then the jury determines, the jury determine -- can determine from those circumstances that there was legal causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.439" offset="3845099">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit took cognizance of the ruling in those three cases to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.205" offset="3864221">The Bigelow case was distinguishable and didn't even attempt to distinguish the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.291" offset="3880521">Now, we make that argument, however, we have a good deal more than that in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.726" offset="3902255">We start out with a general conspiracy to monopolize which was assumed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.969" offset="3923257">And then there is a specific term of that conspiracy that all competition whenever it rates it had would be eliminated and there were series of events which took place in the elimination of some eight oxide mills and the agents for the -- and these mills were sources or supplied for these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.223" offset="3992221">And the chief managing agent in this connection for Union Carbide, the man named Burwell testified at the trial that they eliminated these mills or they took over certain production for the specific reason of keeping them off the American market and for the specific reason of preventing them to be used as a nucleus for a competitive operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.966" offset="4067244">We have that kind of evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.346" offset="4076753">Now, in addition to that and in addition to the intent, the general intent to eliminate competition, we have statements that both of these respondents stated that they directly intended to eliminate these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.279" offset="4128475">It's a specific intent to eliminate directed against these petitioners, and there was a joint refusal to sell by these respondents at the time when they were burdening surpluses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.914" offset="4171003">And in the connection with the joint refusal to sell and these sales were on the basis of a steady, dependable supply over series of years so that they could predicate a manufacturing operation on -- on that supply, the specific evidence was that the refusal to sell was because they wanted to keep the petitioners out of the vanadium business and these came from both sides, both from Union Carbide and from the Vanadium Corporation of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.218" offset="4272253">In addition to that, they interfered with their sources of supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.035" offset="4283538">They eliminated Nisley &amp; Wilson which was their chief vanadium oxide supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.542" offset="4309556">Nisley &amp; Wilson as I say filed his suit in Salt Lake City, he won.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.712" offset="4322200">And Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit said that he was eliminated pursuant to the conspiracy and that the evidence was sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.552" offset="4353546">Now, it's the identical record in San Francisco and in Salt Lake on the issue of Nisley &amp; Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.953" offset="4375176">Therefore, it seems that apparent that reasonable men, it seems obvious that reasonable men can't disagree about an interpretation of this evidence so that the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit said the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict and the judgment that Nisley &amp;Wilson who were the petitioner's principal supplier was eliminated pursuant to that conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.526" offset="4461484">So, there was --</text>

            <text syncTime="1164.860" offset="4762833">The evidence is much broader and we see the Noerr case, it simply permitted a combination -- a combination to lobby or combination to induce the passage of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.776" offset="4806510">In this case, we have a man who is the -- who was a company which is the wholly own subsidiary of one of the respondents, Union Carbide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.266" offset="4840469">The Union Carbide at this time had standing alone, 75% of all the outside produced in America standing alone together, they had 90%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.514" offset="4873383">Union Carbide alone had 75% of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.562" offset="4885608">The Canadian Government appoints this subsidiary to act as a purchasing agent and it doesn't say, “You mustn't buy from this person to that person or the other person.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.309" offset="4924583">And simply says, “You buy vanadium oxide for us, so you buy ferrovanadium for us.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.162" offset="4947989">Then the New York officials under our offer of proof direct the subsidiary, the Canadian subsidiary to refuse to deal with the petitioners at all and to divide the petitioners pre-existing business between the two conspirators which it does.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.002" offset="5115382">That's Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.633" offset="5121860">In connection with our offer of proof, we've been offer to prove that the Canadian Government and the Canadian Metals Controller was oblivious to what was going on in connection with eliminating petitioner and the Court accepted that as far as the offer and went on to say that it didn't make any difference because of the American Banana case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.885" offset="5182882">This is the manner in which was handled by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.175" offset="5192077">What you have here was a discretionary power to purchase which these folks wedded to a pre-existing conspiracy to monopolize or which they use for the purpose of furthering the objectives of that monopolization, and we think that Noerr case has nothing to do with that and the Tenth Circuit made this type of a distinction in connection with these other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.021" offset="5271489">Now, in addition to the actual intent to eliminate the joint refusal to supply, the interference, the sources supply, they also interfered with petitioner's manufacturing contract with the Apex Smelting Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.038" offset="5319555">This is the contract to manufacture ferrovanadium which was the only competitive ferrovanadium to that manufactured by respondents, the only competitive ferrovanadium in the entire period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.405" offset="5368978">VCA entered into negotiations with the Apex Manufacturing Company that have a 14-year contract with petitioners, beginning in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.170" offset="5408057">The VCA entered into negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.421" offset="5417044">And as a result of negotiations, they bought the equipment and the plant was dismantled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.821" offset="5434702">Now, VCA said that it has nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.072" offset="5443688">But on the identical evidence, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and its opinion on the identical evidence on this point said, “This is undisputed that Apex approached VCA to sell its equipment and stock pile but this is also inferable that VCA's interest in the Apex equipment and stock pile was generated by the plan to discourage independent milling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.142" offset="5539924">I say again, while the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit says that reasonable men couldn't possibly disagree with respect to what these facts shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.664" offset="5566046">Here, we have Tenth Circuit finding that the elimination of Apex to purchase of its equipment of dismantling of that plant which petitioners used to produce ferrovanadium was done pursuant to this scheme to monopolize the industry and to eliminate competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.528" offset="5625501">In addition to that, there was a possibility the petitioners were going to set up a mill in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.724" offset="5646294">The Durango mill which had been built by the Government and which was taken over by the petitioners at the time when they admitted, they didn't need another mill because they closed down some of their own mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.488" offset="5681298">And then in their office, the memorandum of the petitioners states, “That we must get our hands on this mill --” of the respondents rather states, “That we must get our hands on this mill to prevent competition in the post-war era."</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.319" offset="5736678">And the evidence shows that these petitioners and other various substantial mining companies at that time were negotiating to acquire this mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.584" offset="5777742">In addition to that, they fixed prices on the vanadium oxides sole and these petitioners bought that vanadium oxide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.075" offset="5803656">So the answer to Mr. Justice Black's question yesterday should have been that in addition to the intent to eliminate -- in addition to this specific intent to eliminate these petitioners, there was all of these evidence that interference with the sources supply, joint refusal to supply the acquisition of the Apex manufacturing facilities and the acquisition of the mill, they get the need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.524" offset="5893517">I don't know actually how much more evidence you can produce in the case of this type so I think the evidence was manifestly sufficient to permit a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.711" offset="5926222">Now, a jury might have found against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.822" offset="5934686">The jury was never permitted to find against this based on adequate instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.589" offset="5953703">For this reason, we respectfully submit that the decision of the Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit should be reversed and this case, we send back in trial court.</text>
