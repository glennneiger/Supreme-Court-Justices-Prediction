            <label>Mr. David Previant</label>
            <text syncTime="88.472" offset="457226">They probably still in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.363" offset="468825">The Federal District Court in this case and the Court of Appeals in this case found that the answer was very simple and they held that the Norris-LaGuardia Act did not preclude the District Court from issuing an injunction under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.226" offset="536325">The facts too are simple and in large measure undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.939" offset="563179">The petitioner here is the local labor union in Wichita, Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.519" offset="585435">The respondents here are some six carriers of motor freight, common carriers, who are engaged in the “for-hire transportation” of motor freight between the states and all of whom have a terminal in the City of Wichita, Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.940" offset="663176">The employees of all of these carriers in the City of Wichita, Kansas, that is the drivers and the warehousemen are members of the petitioner union.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.924" offset="715107">The office and clerical employees are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.228" offset="736319">The union and the employer, I'll use the singular for the sake of simplicity, have entered into collective bargaining agreements, one which covers their interstate transportation of goods and one which covers the local transportation of goods in the Wichita area.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.116" offset="827852">They are known respectively as the over-the-road contract and the local cartage contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.944" offset="855124">These agreements are multi-employer agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.763" offset="866408">They are negotiated over a wide area with many employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.135" offset="883963">It is the identical agreement which was before this Court in a different posture in the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.383" offset="912906">Pertinent to these proceedings are two provisions of that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.234" offset="936312">One is a so-called protection of rights clause which provides that it shall not be a violation of the agreement if employees covered by the agreements refuse to go through a picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.231" offset="1000260">The second provision is a rather lengthy grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.336" offset="1028681">It provides that there shall be no strike or legal proceedings without first using all possible means of settlement as provided in this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.905" offset="1074970">It should be pointed out here that the contract itself was in the record in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals, but the contract itself is not here and this particular article of the contract was not unfortunately printed in extenso.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.470" offset="1141217">I say this because there are some suggestion that this contract contains as a terminal point, an arbitration provision, it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.150" offset="1187924">It provides for a series of appeals through the Local and Area Grievance Committees which are comprised of both employer and union representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.500" offset="1237347">It further provides that in the event of a failure to resolve the grievance at the last level, the parties may submit the matter to an umpire, but the parties, both parties must agree and if both parties do not agree then it provides that either party is provided all lawful economic recourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.121" offset="1335881">In other words, the union could strike in the event they did not agree to submit to umpire handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.813" offset="1358660">Now that particular provision is not necessarily crucial to the determination in this case, but since there has been so much talk about no-strike clauses being quid pro quo for arbitration clauses, I think we ought to set this picture in this case right, that we do not have here a clause which requires the union to submit its grievance to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.597" offset="1457716">The clause does require the union to submit to an arbitration or rather a grievance procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.023" offset="1511424">I don't think that counsel would differ with me as to what I say that the clause does not require arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.878" offset="1542875">I say that the contracts were in the record in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.751" offset="1554369">They were physically in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.407" offset="1565027">In preparing this record, unfortunately, there was some reference only to the contract as it appeared in the findings and therefore the entire article was not printed.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="388.011" offset="1655411">Did you say Mr. Previant, these are the same contracts we had in [Inaudible]?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_previant" startTime="392.282" stopTime="751.477">
            <label>Mr. David Previant</label>

            <text syncTime="393.175" offset="1676100">Yes, they -- and the grievance procedure clause is essentially identically the same as the record [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="402.364" offset="1712880">Well, in July of 1959, during the life of this contract, the union decided that it wanted to organize the unorganized office and clerical employees of the employers with whom it had this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.668" offset="1778082">Accordingly, a letter was sent to the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.745" offset="1794382">The letter advised the employers of the union's interest in the -- in the office and clerical employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.406" offset="1828968">It stated among other things that to induce your employees to join this union, we shall picket your establishment on or about the 27th of July, stated among other things and engaging in this picketing campaign we're speaking for the members of our organization who are employed in businesses like yours and who feel the brunt of unfair competition of your unorganized employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.670" offset="1922069">The letter did emphasize that it had no quarrel or dispute with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.300" offset="1940564">It was making no demands upon the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.625" offset="1953834">The letter acknowledged that until such time as the union obtained the majority representation status, it could not make any such demands upon the employer for recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.108" offset="1999809">Thereafter, within several days, the picketing started.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.885" offset="2018931">Picket signs said merely organize.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.554" offset="2033560">They urged the office employees of this terminal to join Teamsters Union Local 795.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.699" offset="2062190">This picketing was peaceful at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.090" offset="2079744">Drivers who were members of the union and employed at these terminals upon approaching the picket line and identifying it as a picket line, established by their Local Union, or other members of Teamsters Unions in other parts of the country who might had been interchanging freight at these terminals refused to go through these picket lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.227" offset="2180263">Members of the Union refused to work behind the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.042" offset="2199489">The result was of course, the business being conducted by these employers at these terminals was disrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.697" offset="2238151">For all practical purposes, I guess the record would permit of a conclusion that it was just as though their employees had gone out on a direct strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.299" offset="2276603">An ex parte restraining order was entered by the District Court upon application of the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.780" offset="2298441">The Union was restrained from violating the existing contract, from picketing in the premises of the employer and from otherwise tying up the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.181" offset="2356120">I think it is important to emphasize here also that the employers in presenting their petition to the District Court made no claim that this was a matter which was subject to the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.687" offset="2406170">They did not ask that the matter be submitted to the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.293" offset="2424560">They did not ask for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.400" offset="2436995">On the contrary, their theory was that there was absolutely no dispute between the employers and the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.451" offset="2481194">There was no grievance and that accordingly, the union's activity was in violation of the provision of the contract which said there shall be no strike until all means the settlement have been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.191" offset="2536155">The union of course denied that its activities constituted a breach of the contract and it challenged the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court under the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.966" offset="2575235">After a hearing on a permanent injunction, the court found that the picketing had caused a concerted stoppage, that the stoppage was a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.639" offset="2617971">That there was no controversy between the union and the employers that the picketing which caused the strike was in violation of the contract, that the picket line clause upon which the union relied was not applicable, that the court did have jurisdiction under the Norris-LaGuardia Act because in the lower court's opinion, the suit does not involve or grow out of a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.005" offset="2715355">And a permanent junction enjoined, restrained and prohibited the union and its officers from violating the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement by engaging in picketing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.675" offset="2766033">When no labor dispute is dissolved -- is involved and which causes its members to engage in a concerted stoppage or interruption of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.333" offset="2796753">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.096" offset="2819741">It found that there was a breach of contract, that these activities did violate the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.533" offset="2845550">It further found that although the controversy might come within the literal reading of Norris-LaGuardia, but nevertheless, the jurisdictional limitations found in Norris-LaGuardia must now be read in light of the provisions of Section 301 of the subsequent Taft-Hartley enactment and found that the policy expressed in 301 would confer upon the courts a jurisdiction to restrain a violation of the contract even though it involved picketing and strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.652" offset="2985984">Well, the Court of Appeals did -- did not concur in the finding that there was no labor dispute, but found that 301 nevertheless superseded or repealed or had to be accommodated to the Norris-LaGuardia and that in breaking that, the combination or comparison, there was a legislative intent to carve this kind of strike and picketing from under what had previously been the hospitable scope of Norris-LaGuardia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.388" offset="5360933">I would also pass over rather hurriedly the question as to whether or not Norris-LaGuardia did apply in the past to contract violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.837" offset="5394683">We have set forth the conclusion in our brief that the United Mine Workers case is a clear example of the attempted application of Norris-LaGuardia to a dispute involving a breach of contract and although the decision of the court was not in harmony in the case, certainly I believe all of the justices who participated in that case felt that this was a Norris-LaGuardia case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.650" offset="5498023">The other question was whether or not it applied to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.303" offset="5516622">I think that we then get to the point which one of our brothers mentioned this morning, since the lower court looks to Section 301 to determine whether there has been any erosion on Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.950" offset="5571166">We look at the statute on its face and see what the comfort we can get from examining that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.916" offset="5599065">We believe that the examination of the statute itself demonstrates that Congress knew what it was about, that what it intended to repeal or set aside the application of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, it did so specifically and unequivocally and that we would conclude from that that any other provision of the Act that which Congress did demonstrate, this intention, if it intended clearly that Norris-LaGuardia Act shall continue to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.712" offset="5718183">We point out in our brief that the secondary boycott provision for example, the Taft-Hartley, is -- provides that it -- in fact provides mandatorily that the National Labor Relations Board shall after investigation and upon concluding that, there is a violation of the Act, go into the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.887" offset="5810970">It provides as to on a provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act that it has the discretionary power to go into the District Court upon a finding or a belief that there is a violation and we find a specific provision that in exercising either the mandatory or the discretionary power to go to the District Courts for relief from alleged violations of these particular provisions of the Act that the jurisdiction of the District Court is not to be limited by the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the specific provision so holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.255" offset="5960391">Then we -- we get to the national emergency provisions and we find similarly that after the procedures that are required under the national emergency provisions had been exhausted, there may be an injunction for a limited period of time and again a specific provision that the Norris-LaGuardia Act shall not apply in the application for such injunction against the national emergency strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.809" offset="6046595">The Taft-Hartley Act further has a provision in connection with trustee funds that in the event there's been a violation of that Section and Section 302, then there may be a restraining order applied for it issued in the Federal District Court and again, expressly stating without regard to the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.572" offset="6129664">I must note it that in each instance, the Government is the party and not the private party, except in the last instance which is not really a dispute kind of a situation and we believe that this demonstrates a considered congressional judgment that if the Norris-LaGuardia Act is to be set aside in any way or in any manner, it would be done only under limited circumstances and it would be done specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.334" offset="6228720">We also, certainly on the case of this evidence, would have to conclude that we're not dealing with one of those statutes that one of the courts referred to as obscure or generally forgotten so that we might loosen up on our application of a rule of -- still by implication but this was certainly a statute which was foremost in the minds of the Congress in revising the Wagner Act of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.416" offset="6333001">That appears on the face of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.778" offset="6346480">Then move to the other handy like tool for interpretation and look at the legislative history and again we find that there was in the legislative history attempts made to relax the provisions of Norris-LaGuardia particularly in contract violation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.278" offset="6428505">That history is set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.763" offset="6434461">That history incidentally is set forth in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's appendix to his opinion in the Lincoln Mills case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.799" offset="6466539">What it shows is that the House Bill 3020 provided specifically that a suit for a violation of the collective bargaining agreement could be brought in the Federal District Court and that the Norris-LaGuardia Act specifically by title would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.692" offset="6558177">The Senate approach and this was a problem, as this Court pointed out in the Lincoln Mills decision, this problem of adherence to contract, the Senate approach was that in the event -- that a contract violation would be an unfair labor practice and would be subject to adjudication by the courts and then -- but then normally follow that under its discretionary power, if and so that a particular contract violation created some situation was -- which would require action, it could then go under the discretionary injunction procedure and the Norris-LaGuardia would not apply in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.300" offset="6708537">These two differences among others have to go to conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.394" offset="6728913">And when that came out of conference, Conference Report repeated the fact that 3020 has specifically set aside Norris-LaGuardia and that the Senate version did not, but it went on to say we have retained only part of that provision and the only part that was retained was a provision that would set aside Section 6 of Norris-LaGuardia which imposed a rather strict test that this Court will recall on imposing liability upon unions for acts of their agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.322" offset="6876662">This is all that came out of the legislative bill with respect to Norris-LaGuardia and they said that they would then leave the enforcements of contracts to the normal judicial processes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2205.937" offset="8927169">This Court held it did, but it did so upon the peculiar and unique history of the Railway Labor Act, the circumstances under which it was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.871" offset="8986833">The agreement of all of the parties, both those who favored it and those who were opposed to it that the Congress was actually imposing compulsory arbitration in the railroad industry in cases of contract interpretation grievances and a specific provision and subsequently, the court in explaining it, I think made it clear that they were dealing with a particular industry as distinguished from industry in general, a particular legislative act as distinguished from the general act and found that there was just no basis for a holding that to restraint this strike under this law would cause a breach in Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.251" offset="9176377">Now we suggest that the differences here are manifested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.295" offset="9204590">We have here -- and in the Railway Labor Act, you had a complete absence of history with respect to what was intended with regard to Norris-LaGuardia and that is why the Court was confronted with this problem of accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.679" offset="9262059">Here in the face of the history which I had just recited briefly, it would seem that there is no room, there is no requirement that an effort be made to accommodate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.880" offset="9326843">It is not the kind of a case where we act -- we are at a loss with respect to congressional policy because we say the statute on its face and the legislative history is clear that whatever erosions or intrusions or inroads into Norris-LaGuardia were going to be made, were being made specifically and in a very limited fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.981" offset="9419316">And I don't believe that on the basis of that kind of a showing, we can assume that other erosions were made that were not referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.348" offset="9452753">There are other cases which this Court considered, I believe in Lincoln Mills in which what appeared to be an injunction covered by the literal language of Norris-LaGuardia was held not to be and these other railway cases to which I referred earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.029" offset="9527463">There of course what the Court was trying to do was to accommodate the legislative declaration as to the requirement of the railway employer to bargain, to require labor unions to represent their members fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.135" offset="9603950">It found that the kind of injunction that was considered was not the kind of injunction which was before the Congress when Norris-LaGuardia was being discussed and found that the Section 7 test were clearly in apposite and therefore concluded that there would be no erosion, there would no interference with Norris-LaGuardia, there'd be no violation of Norris-LaGuardia Act in the event that injunctions were issued in those cases, I would -- I would emphasize here as distinguished from Lincoln Mills and the other railroad cases other than the Chicago River case that we are dealing with that kind of act which under Section 4 of Norris-LaGuardia is not to be restrained in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.352" offset="9804779">And Mr. Justice Frankfurter said, of course Norris-LaGuardia does not inhibit the federal courts from exercising jurisdiction in all labor dispute cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.957" offset="9843231">That is so, but it does say to the federal court that it has no jurisdiction with respect to particular kinds of activities which are peaceful, non-violent, non-fraudulent, picketing and inducing their right to strike and striking being those kind of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.451" offset="9921181">So, we're dealing here with rights which had it special in a particular shelter under Norris-LaGuardia and surely those rights are not to be set aside because a right of action for a breach of contract was placed in the jurisdiction of the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.273" offset="10792417">Before that particular grievance could be processed, the employer brought the matter back to the federal district judge who held that all of these matters were simulated within the judgment which he had entered and restrained the union from proceeding in its claim for damages because the employer has violated the contract in going to court rather than submitting to grievance procedure.</text>
