            <text syncTime="100.058" offset="503620">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.056" offset="519607">The -- I think I'll go to the contract and come back to the tort because there is a certain amount of interrelationship between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.139" offset="579897">We start of with the realization that the heart core of both the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts is Congress' faith in the process of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.182" offset="652100">They felt that if unions were protected in organizing and collective-bargaining was made available to them by law that the free flow of commerce would be eventually fostered by the results.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.739" offset="746350">The Congress did not make any effort to -- they were not interested in what the results of collective bargaining were in the sense of what the terms, the substantive terms of the contract would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.340" offset="804760">They felt that that was up to the parties whether the contract resulted in terms that were harsh or easy, or for the employer or for the union or the employees was a matter of their relative bargaining strength of the justice of -- with which they were able to bargain at the table, and that was left to the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.406" offset="928998">In other words, in looking at the contract from the -- with the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts in mind, the intent of the parties was the matter -- was the thing that should govern rather than some preconceived notions of Congress as to what should be in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.676" offset="1014053">This of course does not apply to the closed shop provision which is outright, but as to the other terms, that was up to the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.351" offset="1048743">So in looking at the contract, we try to carry on -- out the intent of the parties and try to ascertain what the intent was from a realistic standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.445" offset="1105168">It also was obvious -- it is obvious from the congressional reports that Congress was well aware of the very common use of the no-strike clause expressed in contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.778" offset="1182490">It certainly -- all surveys show that most -- the great majority of contracts contained, expressed no-strike clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.614" offset="1233795">It was also -- the history shows that Congress considered that the no-strike clause would be included in the contract or excluded from a contract as a result of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.975" offset="1299310">They hoped that the no-strike clause would be included in a contract because that would normally lead to industrial fees, but it was to be included or excluded as a result of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.509" offset="1357406">Our prime objection, our sort of basic objection to the judgment of the court below is that the court was unwilling to look to the intent of the parties in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.203" offset="1404217">They were unwilling to give sway -- full sway to the process of collective-bargaining where they felt that the contract should contain a strike prohibition, a no-strike clause, they attributed a strike prohibition to the contract without regard -- without regard to whether a no-strike provision was to be implied from a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.410" offset="1516962">They state that expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.201" offset="1524172">They say it is not necessary to imply a strike prohibition.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>

            <text syncTime="363.392" offset="1556982">I'd like to come to that little later, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.227" offset="1568266">I think that's a very important part.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.411" offset="1581014">Now, with respect to our position is that strike prohibitions are not to be imported to a contract or not to be attributed to a contract unless they are to be found in the intent of the contract from a realistic standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.851" offset="1678817">We -- many times it has been said that the arbitration provision is the quid pro quo of the no-strike clause or -- it's generally stated the other way, that the no-strike clause is the quid pro quo of the arbitration provision, and this is a proper statement when there is no strike provision and there's no arbitration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.187" offset="1780172">It -- or when talking about the subjects to be negotiated at the bargaining table, one is very frequently the quid pro quo of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.662" offset="1830013">On the other hand, in looking at a contract to determine whether a no-strike provision should be implied, it certainly is improper to say where there is an arbitration provision, a no-strike provision will be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.427" offset="1893125">In the first place, if that so, fairness and logic would say when there is a no strike provision and there's no arbitration provision, we will imply an arbitration provision and yet nobody would say that.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.208" offset="2124152">Yes, but they'd have to setup the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.673" offset="2134079">This is -- this is something that has been worked out in advance just like what's the point of having a grievance procedure short of arbitration, people can go to arbitration you say.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.418" offset="2197086">Well, people normally do use a grievance procedure before they go to arbitration because it's been setup there, even though it's not required to.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.733" offset="2238255">Even though they can say you're not interested in a preliminary grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.421" offset="2261034">The -- I can -- there's a very -- there is undoubtedly something very attractive about saying, “When there's an arbitration provision, necessarily, there is a strike prohibition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="553.569" offset="2317667">I submit that this frustrates the intent of the parties when the parties decide that there is not -- that they will not put in a no-strike provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.570" offset="2369703">The intent should govern regardless of the attractiveness of a -- implied a no-strike -- a strike provision implied in law rather than in fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.191" offset="6288175">At least as applied here, I believe that the rule is clear, and I think that rule, and I say that in humility, I think the rule is that whenever a state court has before it, whether in tort or in contract, condone which is either clearly or fairly to be assumed to be, or arguably it's protected by Section 7 or condemned as an unfair labor practice by Section 8 of the Taft-Hartley law, that the state court should in that instance defer to the initial jurisdiction of the specialized tribunal of Congress created to deal with these matters, the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.268" offset="6468420">Now, we don't believe that counsel is very serious in asserting that their conduct in this matter was condemned by Section 8 as an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.825" offset="6518680">They have nowhere asserted just what section -- what part of Section 8 they're violating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.137" offset="6543966">I believe Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked counsel that question directly yesterday and said just what part do you mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.349" offset="6572805">He received no answer and we have received no answer throughout these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.865" offset="6598823">We think, however, if there is any thrust of their argument at all, it relates to their contention that their conduct was arguably protected by the mutual aid and protection language of Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.249" offset="6668413">So this is the question to which I would like to direct my first remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.715" offset="6690252">I think that by reviewing a few of the facts of this case, it will become apparent that at the time this matter was presented to the state court, and the state court was asked to defer to the initial jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, it was not a matter that could be fairly assume to be or even arguably conduct protected by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.700" offset="6810206">And moreover, it is our position that this statement is based on facts which had already been found and stipulated to before the state court was asked to defer to the alleged jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.040" offset="6879483">Now, the facts have been pretty well outlined from time to time but some of them have been overlooked.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.661" offset="7214059">And specifically, I think that we are also concerned with whether this union acted, acted in such a way as to violate the National Labor Relations Act, and acted as they can in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.260" offset="7272364">I think the relative bargaining power does have some applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.832" offset="7290650">This is particularly true, Mr. Justice Black, because counsel has just finished an argument based on what he said is the intent of the parties to this contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.422" offset="7445086">And when we're concerned of what it means, we could as in the case of Congress, search back to the congressional record to see what they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.111" offset="7475806">Here, of course, I'm submitting that we do not have that avenue of research open to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.371" offset="7504854">Now here, Melvin Welsch is the name of this employee, he had been employed by Lucas about two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.333" offset="7532753">He was incompetent, so incompetent as to be dangerous not only to himself but to the company and his fellow employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.482" offset="7561279">The union would not let him be fired, not just on this occasion but the record shows on numerous occasions prior to this date when the company tried to fire this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.076" offset="7603702">The union said you fire him and we'll close you down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.172" offset="7624077">This in spite of the fact that the union had, as I submit, imposed a contract upon this employer which reserved to the employer the right to discharge unsatisfactory employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.630" offset="7673919">Now all of these of course is why the employer in the ultimate act to discharge hemmed and hawed considerably, before reaching the decisive decision only when the union business agent called him up as the records shows, and said either you take him back to work we're going “shut your joint down” as the record indicates without dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.469" offset="7777259">Now, it was this tyrannical conduct which finally triggered the discharge which led to this strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.252" offset="7808397">Not because the other employees were unhappy, the undisputed testimony is that the other employees agreed with management but Welsch was incompetent and dangerous, but nonetheless they were called off, they stayed home and the company was shut down, there were no deliveries allowed in or out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.114" offset="7899826">In fact the Vice President of this local and its principal business agent personally chased one of the officers of this company when he tried to load a few sacks of flour into his automobile and deliver them about to town, chased him around town until he got lost in the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.638" offset="7965968">Why such enthusiasm to keep this one incompetent employee when 400 or 500 such contracts exist in the Seattle area with this vast local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.495" offset="8005360">I don't think we'll ever know the interior answer to that although counsel has urged at every level that their motives were pure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.857" offset="8038797">I do know that there was evidence undisputed that perhaps this company, the Lucas Flour Company had offended the union, because it had employed a man called Lawrence Anderson who had the (Inaudible) to be one of the group who are seeking an audit of the books of the union in a totally separate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.495" offset="8109328">And although he was a member in good standing, the union tried to get him fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.580" offset="8129703">And the union -- the company would not fire this man simply because he had a quarrel with the union officials, and this very possibly is why the Court decided at all levels that the union did not act for mutual aid and protection as a matter of subjective motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.782" offset="8206503">As I shall say in a moment, I don't think subjective motive has anything to do with it, but the counsel so asserted it was their principal defense at the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.233" offset="8244328">Now continuing our chronology of what occurred, and here, I'm trying to lay before this Court, the pictures that actually was presented to the state courts, the suit was brought in May 1958, immediately after the strike began, and there were various proceedings in and out of court, pleadings filed affidavits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.734" offset="13578324">At that stage, the Court might very well have deferred the jurisdiction to the NLRB, an action or a proceeding could have been initiated by the employer in the –- in the local office of the NLRB and perhaps if we convince the regional council, some sort of an injunction would be issued to stop the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.661" offset="13653974">By the time this contention was raised, however, and for the first time in the Superior Court of King County, already the strike was over and was moot, the injunction was moot, the trial court so states at the outset, the facts had become agreed and stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.158" offset="13720012">The only matter that was left was damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.389" offset="13740910">The employer had no complaint to file at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.475" offset="13753240">There was no unfair labor practice then being committed by the -– by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.760" offset="13770376">The union has never asserted there was an unfair labor practice committed by the employer in those terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="3461.790" offset="13950516">One is, was this protected or was this condemned by Section 8 and I've already I think answered that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.218" offset="13976221">There is nothing in Section 8 of the Taft-Hartley Act which renders an unfair labor practice that which was done by the union in this instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.725" offset="14058245">And frankly, I can only do what the Supreme Court of the State of Washington does if you will review what they say since nothing is said in the briefs or in argument to support this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.117" offset="14103803">The State of Washington Supreme Court prints in its entirety in the opinion the Section 8 of the Taft-Hartley Act, condemning certain unfair labor practices by the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="3525.173" offset="14204113">Now, another argument or issue in this case on which I don't wish to spend any time is the question of whether they failed to exhaust the remedies below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.265" offset="14256462">I merely reiterate to this Court what is obvious that there was available to this union, a petition for rehearing before all nine judges of the State Supreme Court of the State of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="3563.229" offset="14356250">I do know that it is no answer to say that it is a routine technicality which would have been futile.</text>

            <text syncTime="4011.607" offset="16149817">I would like to know which were the two and which were the three, but I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.592" offset="16173746">Now, let me turn if I may to the more serious question of breach of contract which is correctly been pinpointed here yesterday as an alternative ground for the upholding of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington either tort or contract supports the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.796" offset="16242604">Now, in the Dowd case which was argued yesterday, it was asserted by the petitioner that Section 301 deprives the state court of all jurisdictions over breaches of contract of collective bargaining agreements in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.750" offset="16310418">And I can only say as to that since I haven't been asked to argue that case that I read its briefs and hardly accord with the brief filed by the Attorney General of the State of Wisconsin amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.844" offset="16366738">I feel compelled because the result in that case would have such an effect upon this one, they had one comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.589" offset="16393697">It was argued in that case with much bigger that Congress expressly grants state's jurisdiction over a federally created causes of action when this is intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.118" offset="16427865">And there he cited Section 303 of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.286" offset="16444479">I can only respond that this is because the substantive jurisdiction of state courts to try any federal offense derives any federally created cause of action, derives from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.890" offset="16502888">The right to try a suit for breach of contract in the State of Washington does not derive from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.895" offset="16534967">It is the historic jurisdiction of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.479" offset="16549282">It is so ancient and so firmly established that surely it would require an expressed statement by Congress to the contrary, to deprive them of that jurisdiction, and this I think is a distinction in which if I may say with difference to counsel in that case should have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.544" offset="16613543">And I make it now only because I sat camping at the bench in the corner listening to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.796" offset="16642591">Now, returning to argue with my own case rather than that one, here, the petitioner only argues that the Lincoln Mill's decision substituted federal common law for a state contract law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.859" offset="16702777">And both sides, I noticed in the Dowd case, took the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.647" offset="16722004">So I find myself one against four because I don't agree that that is what the Lincoln Mills case said at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.700" offset="16750216">That was a case brought in federal court under Section 301 which conferred jurisdiction substantively, remedially or procedurally makes no difference which in fact conferred jurisdiction upon federal courts to try breaches of collective bargaining agreements in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.148" offset="16827956">It was a case of that sort and the issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.836" offset="16842689">And the issue which as I understand that was decided in this Court is to what law should govern that kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.502" offset="16877380">There is no discussion in the Lincoln Mills' decision or in any of the opinions filed with it which states what law should be applied to a state court determining under its historic jurisdiction, the breaches of contract cases that come before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.532" offset="16957524">In other words, the Lincoln Mills case created -- said that Section 301 created not only a form, a new form, for such cases, but also a new remedy, a substantive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.293" offset="17008515">It said nothing at all as I read the decision of that court as to what the substantive law of contract was, nor that it should be applied by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.947" offset="17055117">I can only note that the majority opinion in the Lincoln Mills case refers with approval to Judge Wyzanki's opinion in Massachusetts where that judge makes a very clear and very persuasive distinction between substantive remedial law and substantive contract law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4306.405" offset="17328985">And what it did not hold is what everybody seems to have agreed three counts in a row and that is that the State of Washington is bound to apply a federal common law in deciding cases involving breaches of contract before it if they fall in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.175" offset="17396067">Now, whether this would be true or not, however, it does not have to be decided by this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.484" offset="17421354">It's probably entirely academic because when it is asserted boldly in the brief of the petitioner that the State of Washington here applied state contract law, I see no basis or authority for that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.939" offset="17491153">The Washington State Supreme Court as a matter of fact in this case cited no legal authority for its determination that there was a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.232" offset="17520306">It cites no scholars and no cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.444" offset="17537128">I think the Court of the State of Washington was rather outraged that it should be contended, seriously, that it is not a breach of contract to strike -- to require an employer not to exercise the duties or the rights which are expressly reserved to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.268" offset="17604420">In fact, the Court makes this rather clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.497" offset="17621347">I submit that some fine construction of the words of the arbitration provisions of the contract here in question can be and were argued at all levels of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.866" offset="17670875">But if it is true as counsel says that he stipulates that there was a no-strike provision if the arbitration involved interpretation of the contract, then I must direct his attention to page 214 of the record before this Court where the arbitrators are speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.416" offset="17765021">And this is what the arbitrators held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.126" offset="17775888">It will be recalled and I quote, “That under the working agreement, the employer reserved the right to discharge any man in his employees if his work is not satisfactory.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.199" offset="17812146">The Board feels that a proper interpretation of that clause is that the right of discharge is preserved in the case where the man's services are not satisfactory to his employer but that the right must be invoked reasonably and in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.275" offset="17872436">During oral argument, counsel for the parties virtually agreed that such should be the interpretation although disagreeing as to its application under the facts in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="4683.018" offset="18835414">You're quite right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.015" offset="18843460">Let me add this word on this subject because it -- I think it should be said.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.927" offset="18863104">Are we going to hold that it is the law that a union can agree to a $3 wage to the employees, sign it solemnly, and the next morning call out its people and put up pickets demanding $4?</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.761" offset="18918379">Because this is exactly what this local is saying, it has the right to do without breaching the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.952" offset="18943143">Can it do so even though there is written into its contract an arbitration clause which says that matters in dispute shall be arbitrated?</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.450" offset="18977207">Incidentally, there's been some argument at all levels of this case that after all, the employer didn't demand arbitration to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.867" offset="19014823">Well, of course, all that the employer was doing was doing what he had an expressed right to do and do it to discharge a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.588" offset="19041677">There's nothing in the labor contract that says you shall never discharge a man or I suppose sell some flour without arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.651" offset="19073964">This reaches to absurdity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.757" offset="19082428">The point is that the union exercise economic power, overwhelming economic power, conclusive economic power in this instance to force an employer to do something or to refrain from doing something which he had a clear right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.557" offset="19157556">Or for that matter, could an employer agree to pay $3 an hour and cut the wages to $2.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.540" offset="19181484">Now, if the man wouldn't agree, lock him out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.432" offset="19197053">Because again, this is exactly what this local says it can do without breaching contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.828" offset="19222653">Now, I recognize that this Court is confronted daily with profound and difficult conceptual problems particularly in this empty blackness of jurisdictional lines to be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.457" offset="19273226">I recognize that this Court has to deal with difficult relationships, but I also and reminded constantly in sitting here that this is the Supreme Court, the Highest Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.144" offset="19315963">And we do have before us a question of something that is fairly fundamental, a right or wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.157" offset="19343966">Unless the Supreme Court of the State of Washington is upheld in this matter, in this case, a real and genuine injustice has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.991" offset="19387329">We are holding that in effect, this respondent has no remedy and no solution, unless he had what he did take by arbitration and subsequently in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.049" offset="19439574">In other words, it is the duty of course of this Court to use its phrase to elucidate in litigation these difficult areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.319" offset="19468622">It has of course also a higher duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.625" offset="19477922">And we submit that in this case, it points very clearly to doing justice and equity in this case and thereby affirming this rather small and perhaps to this union a rather insignificant little judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.643" offset="19529958">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="5616.248" offset="22568312">That being so, the issue as to -- the issue as to whether this was a protected activity which doesn't come down to just the item of the -- that was determined by the Arbitration Board but comes down to what the union had reason to believe was happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="5641.527" offset="22669458">In other words, did the -- did the employer mislead the union into thinking that they had to go out on strike and the arbitrators stated this and the lower court, the trial court stated that they were so mislead, that was an issue that should have been decided not by the trial court, but by the Labor Board.</text>
