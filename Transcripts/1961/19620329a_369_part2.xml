            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="5.817" offset="126621">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.558" offset="129651">Before the recess, I was undertaking to show that, in this case, the Georgia Court of Appeals had in fact applied to a clear and present danger test.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.072" offset="167685">Only seven months after the Wood decision, a decision in this case, the Court of Appeals stated in the Renfro case "but even constitutional courts are limited to the extent that there must be a clear and present danger to the administration of justice," citing the Wood case as authority for that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.142" offset="247933">That decision was rendered by a judge of the same division of the Court of Appeals of Georgia as the judge who wrote the decision -- the majority decision in the Wood case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.955" offset="287222">Coming now to the application by the court of that route, we might state as a matter of state substantive law that the grand jury, as an arm of the court and that its proceedings constitute a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.537" offset="337481">Consequently, any effort to interfere, to influence the grand jury is punishable to the same extent, so the cases say, there's an effort to influence or interfere with the petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.964" offset="387218">Judge Field's famous charge delivered in 1872 to the grand jury, he deplored the frequent efforts of "private prosecutors to intrude themselves into your presence to obtain or prevent to present one or indictment of parties."</text>
            <text syncTime="87.183" offset="452106">The significance attached to grand jury proceedings is very well borne out by the decisions of this Court with reference to jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.120" offset="483871">The court has held that even though a defendant is convicted by a jury in which there was no discrimination and in which there was ample evidence to support the verdict of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.290" offset="528488">Nevertheless, if there was discrimination in selection of the grand jury, the conviction will be set aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.429" offset="553044">One thing bothers me.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.940" offset="559104">How do you reconcile your state court's decision as to count two which has gone unsubstantiated because no clear and present danger has been shown handing this letter of communication to the grand jury foreman?</text>
            <text syncTime="132.559" offset="633605">Was its finding that the -- there was a clear and present danger in the other two?</text>

            <text syncTime="139.980" offset="663280">I think it's wrong, but the state did not undertake to have it reviewed below and, of course, I say you can't do so in this juncture.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="156.935" offset="731094">The question I am putting to you is that, if there was no clear and present danger as your state court found involved in the Count 2 was reversed, what remains to be said in defense of the holding if there was a clear and present danger in respect to the other two counts in which you prevail?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="e_freeman_leverett" startTime="178.960" stopTime="182.827">
            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="178.960" offset="819179">I would simply say that I think the Court of Appeals erred in so holding the count two.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="182.827" stopTime="184.117">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="e_freeman_leverett" startTime="184.117" stopTime="439.333">
            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="184.117" offset="839868">I would simply say that, in my opinion, the Court of Appeals erred in count two, in holding that there was no clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.620" offset="865886">I think that there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.193" offset="872155">But I think, there, our whole reasoning was based upon the assumption that they could consider only that particular letter and that on its face, that letter did not indicate that it would interfere, that it perhaps was bringing something new to the attention of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.294" offset="932551">In some states do permit that so long as a communication to a grand jury does not deal with a pending matter if it undertakes to inject a new claim or a new charge that they commit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.532" offset="985527">That has been upheld in some states.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.702" offset="994200">I know of no particular authority in Georgia one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.091" offset="1015724">Efforts to influence grand juries are declared crimes by Title 18 Section 1504.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.135" offset="1039862">They are uniformly held punishable as contempt by the state cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.645" offset="1057938">Now, coming to the application of the test, the three decisions of this Court, applying the clear and present danger test, all involved entirely different factual considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.085" offset="1107675">The Bridges, Pennekamp, and Craig cases involved criticism of judicial action already taken or statements which it most could be construed as efforts to influence the trial judge himself, not the lay jury and a great emphasis was placed upon that in concurring opinions in the Shepherd case, Shepherd versus Florida, that was reiterated time and time again in Mr. Justice Reed's decision, I believe, in the Pennekamp case, the assumption being that judges are supposed to be superior individuals who can resist these external pressures.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.561" offset="1261589">This case is, in a sense, the first in which a full court has been faced with the very issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.874" offset="1286875">The case most likely or liken to it is People versus Parker, an Illinois case where the defendant was convicted of contempt in sending the letter to the grand jury urging them to investigate the Chicago Tribune.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.795" offset="1350510">This Court granted certiorari and affirmed by an equally divided vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.721" offset="1370258">Even there, however, that case is not as strong as this because there, as I just previously said, was an effort to bring a new charge to the attention of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.849" offset="1406725">Here, there was an effort to obstruct and to interfere with a charge that had already been given to the grand jury by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.802" offset="1438595">Another case which somewhat approaches this problem is Maryland versus Baltimore Radio Show.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.833" offset="1462732">In that case, the Maryland court, under its interpretation of the Bridges formula, it set aside the contempt conviction of a radio station.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.216" offset="1496273">This station had published or, rather, had broadcast extensively the fact, about two days after a brutal crime had been committed, that the accused had been arrested, that he had confessed, that he'd gone out and reenacted the crime, and that he picked up the bloody knife from underneath some leaves and they also broadcast his prior record.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.115" offset="1575790">The Maryland court, applying the Bridges formula, found that there had been no clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.416" offset="1605047">However, we say that case is distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.265" offset="1616436">To begin with, the opinion denying certiorari by this Court was very careful to point out that the denial in no way was to be construed either as an approval or disapproval of a decision of the Maryland court.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.312" offset="1664606">Secondly, the broadcast was made the day following the arrest of the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.529" offset="1689475">It had a certain news value at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.255" offset="1700342">The Maryland court expressly declared "that it was not concern with deliberate attempts to influence the outcome of a pending case for the reason that the statements there made were news reports and were not argumentative in nature."</text>
            <text syncTime="414.557" offset="1761573">Now here, on the other hand, we say that this case is framed in the strongest possible light.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.240" offset="1784351">The proceeding was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.449" offset="1789158">In one pending just in a technical lawyer sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.963" offset="1799189">It was pending in a realistic sense to the extent that the jury was then considering the very matter in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.800" offset="1830536">These statements by their clear urging told the jury to do one thing when the court had just charged it to do something else.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.333" offset="1860733">Would it be contempt in Georgia for a man who wanted the grand jury to investigate an alleged crime to write them a letter telling them about it or is that customarily done?</text>

            <text syncTime="846.286" offset="3488475">As stated in the Pennekamp case, The comments must be appraised on a balance between the desirability of free discussion and the necessity for fair adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.599" offset="3525778">And, what is the interest here?</text>
            <text syncTime="856.813" offset="3530585">The interest of the State of Georgia and this is a very weighty interest, it's no less important to Georgia than the threat from internal subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.399" offset="3573008">The interest is two-fold, unhampered grand jury proceedings as a general matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.182" offset="3592129">On the Georgia law, it's necessary to have a grand jury indictment to prosecute all felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.770" offset="3614490">The defendant cannot even waive a grand jury indictment in a capital felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.517" offset="3629432">He can in non-capital felonies, in writing, waive the indictment but an indictment is an essential beginning point for a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.200" offset="3664123">And, of course, there's a danger that improper influences creep into the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.045" offset="3683558">The indictment, itself, would be subject to being quashed on motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.214" offset="3700276">Secondly, we think that the other weighting interest that the State of Georgia has is the necessity of enforcing its voting laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.342" offset="3740714">And, I know -- also, I think it's important to point out here that the choice here was not between silence and the right of this petitioner to speak his views.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.247" offset="3780315">He very conceivably might have been on a different position entirely if he waited until after this grand jury proceeding was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.410" offset="3804975">But, let's assume, in the words of the Bridges case, that freedom does not bare an inverse ratio or up to the timeliness of the assertions seeking expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.081" offset="4103711">The Sawyer case, I think, comes into this case in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.158" offset="4116041">In that case, a lawyer was being disciplined for doing just what we have conceded that a private person could not, that is scandalizing the judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.301" offset="4180616">But it seemed to assume that, as to a lawyer, that that would be a permissible rule of conduct to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.492" offset="4213321">That the -- the court's opinion turned on the fact that the utterances there were not aimed at the judge but were aimed in general at this mere fact and there was no effort to scandalize the judge in that particular proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.818" offset="4266611">And, also, another point about this dual personality of Mr. Wood, I think, Mr. Justice Brennan, that the opinion there stated that it's immaterial whether or not Mrs. Sawyer was counsel in that particular case or not that the official transaction thing doesn't have too much to do in that particular context.</text>

            <text syncTime="1088.166" offset="4456051">I think it changes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.169" offset="4460022">I do not think that if he had not been sheriff, that there was not sufficient evidence here to uphold the clear and present danger test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.816" offset="4490637">We say that, because he was sheriff, that it makes it even stronger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.968" offset="4511222">Now, even if we resurrect this Blackstone and Fox controversy and invest it with constitutional dignity, we would reach the same result because Fox says that, while these constructive contempt have not pry to Blackstone's comments with reference to the Ollman case, had not been dealt with summarily that, historically and traditionally contempts by -- contempts by officers of the court had been treated summarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.692" offset="4630131">And here, the court had instructed the jury to perform a stated function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.532" offset="4645491">The defendant interjected himself and told them not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.505" offset="4665344">One last contention I think that should be discussed with respect to the application of this test, concerns the assertion made that you must show that the obstruction actually succeeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.589" offset="4717693">That's not what this Court held in the Bridges case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.606" offset="4725844">It held that you must show that there was a danger, not that the obstruction actually succeeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.763" offset="4754474">Now, petitioner says that the Pennekamp case holds that the danger must be shown by solid evidence but that's not what the court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.570" offset="4781641">The court said that the circumstances likely to give rise to a clear and present danger test must be shown by "a solidity of evidence."</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.159" offset="4819989">If actual obstruction is shown, there's no need for a rule phrased in terms of a danger because the evil itself, and not just its danger, would already, thereby, be a theatre colloquy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.578" offset="4873697">One thing we certainly do not dispute and that is that the mere utterances themselves are sufficient in the same sense that, in a tort action, certain utterance is -- would be conce -- deemed libelous per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.767" offset="4922389">We say you have to consider the circumstances surrounding the time and manner the -- the nature of the pending proceedings, susceptibility of the particular fact-finding body in any and all other circumstances which will have any relevance on the question as to whether the substantive evil would likely come about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.472" offset="5001279">This was the procedure followed in the great cases of Bridges, the Pennekamp, and the Craig cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.572" offset="5025625">In the Pennekamp case -- or rather, in the Bridges case, emphasis was placed on the fact that the statements were made after trial and did not communicate any information which the court did not already know anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.477" offset="5069302">There was no effort to influence the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.475" offset="5081318">In the Pennekamp case, you have substantially the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.675" offset="5098036">Criticism was a judicial action already taken, page 348.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.127" offset="5115904">It did not deal with rulings during the jury trial, also page 348.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.030" offset="5135444">And, the Florida court had expressly questioned the applicability of the Bridges rule to that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.311" offset="5160626">That's at page 345 at footnote 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.611" offset="5173791">In the Craig case, the pertinent facts were that the publications were simply news reports or public business and it most could be construed as calculated to influence not the jury but the judge who the court said, "is supposed to be a man of fortitude, able to strive in a hearty climate."</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.880" offset="5250905">Petitioners also argue that a prejudicial and inflammatory charge should not be made the basis of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.001" offset="5279326">Well, to begin with, we do not concede that the statement of the charge of the court was prejudicial and inflammatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.668" offset="5302000">We say, on the contrary, that it was entitled probably to respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.745" offset="5318301">Well, even assuming arguendo otherwise, the law is that even an erroneous ruling of a court does not excuse contemptuous conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.335" offset="5352678">This Court, therefore, let it link in the United Mine Workers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.835" offset="5370755">Now, there are three cases that are cited for this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.400" offset="5384965">The Louisiana and the Nebraska cases simply hold that a lawyer should not be adjudged in contempt for filing a motion to caution indictment in which he alleges that that indictment was obtained as the result of an improper charge by the grand jury or by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.008" offset="5451421">Obviously, we don't contest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.646" offset="5461974">The Mississippi case simply held that a lawyer -- that -- rather than an indictment itself should be quashed where the judge had in effect, directed the return of an indictment by a charge which actually assumed that crimes had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.292" offset="5540551">The last contention that I come to deals with a point that, as we contend, has not been made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.898" offset="5570957">The demurrers -- that is the issue of truth, the demurrers themselves raise the question that the petition for contempt did not allege that the statements made were false or untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.085" offset="5615679">However, as I -- as we've previously stated, we do not believe that his answer or his response raised the issue of truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.580" offset="5645667">That would be a plea on the Georgia practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.912" offset="5655071">It would have to be a little more formality attached to it in many some statements of opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.040" offset="6775515">Getting back to this issue of truth, the Georgia practice requires that a party make an offer of proof and that a special assignment of error be presented in the bill of exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.917" offset="6823058">That was not done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.036" offset="6831522">The issue was not raised in the petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.786" offset="6846568">That alone was failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.992" offset="6851375">You've got to have a special assignment bearing petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.510" offset="6865377">The first time that he sought to make this issue was in his petition for reconsideration that he filed in the Georgia Supreme Court that was too late at that juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.030" offset="6899440">He al -- he mentioned it in his application for stay to this Court, but he did not mention it in his petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.410" offset="6925040">Under Rule 23, I believe it can't be considered for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.729" offset="6942281">Now, he goes on to say that he was prevented from raising by certain amendments that were filed to the pleadings, and the primary thrust of his argument there is that the petition was amended to make it clear that if he did undertake to prove truth, that he would be held in con -- direct contempt in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.624" offset="7021902">That's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.409" offset="7025037">This amendment that was filed was filed after a hearing on demurrers when, for the first time, the demurrers of the petitioner were filed in which he said that the petition is fatal because it fails to allege that this conduct create a clear and eminent danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.174" offset="7092120">Subsequent to that, the court granted an extension of time for amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.461" offset="7109256">This amendment was filed five days later, on August the 10th, for the purpose of meeting this -- what the Solicitor apparently feared might be a defect in his petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.334" offset="7152724">He amended it by setting out the circumstances surrounding the making of the utterances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.074" offset="7175711">Then, he concluded in this paragraph with the language that's narrowed out upon his foreclosing the issue of truth by saying that the making of these utterances under these circumstances, in effect, was in it of itself a clear and present danger to the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.547" offset="7241540">So, we say that he has not been foreclosed from making this issue as a defese.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.862" offset="7266826">The Court of Appeals ruled on it solely as a question of pleading and if he had actually made it, his offer of proof might have failed for a number of reasons and the issue would not be here in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.676" offset="7306115">And, we think that he's trying to inject into this case a hypothetical issue that has not been presented or decided below.</text>
