            <text syncTime="94.106" offset="479796">But the -- where you have dual regulation and we have for the Federal Act identifying tobacco in one amount and the Georgia Act identified in a different manner, the conflict is what led to what Congress said would happen undue fluctuations in price and I think that that Congress was -- you might say looking in a crystal ball and see and that this would happen, it did happen just like you said it would.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.457" offset="2869164">It's for that reason that this tobacco is aged for about three years after it's bought in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.342" offset="2920782">Then as in this huge (Inaudible), then the chemist of the tobacco company, when they start of manufacture that into cigarette, they have to get in a sample of tobacco because you may have (Inaudible) tobacco just grown on 50 different falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.492" offset="3001344">And they take that tobacco and run that chemical analysis on the samples to see what must be added so that, they were getting uniformity of taste.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.756" offset="3054425">As you know, when you light up a cigarette, you smoke as one cigarette or one cigar, of course we're not dealing with cigar tobacco, which you smoke one cigarette because it has a taste that you like.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.196" offset="3100191">And when you light that cigarette, you expect to have the same taste that the previous cigarette that same brand have, so they must have uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.346" offset="3136763">And in order to get that uniformity, they run this chemical test to see what must be added to that tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.077" offset="3167692">And they add licorice, now honey, and the other flavors that make a Camel cigarette taste like Lucky Strike or Phillip Morris to get that uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.477" offset="3213249">So, there is -- there is nothing that you can say that is uniformed by tobacco.</text>

            <text syncTime="890.539" offset="3665481">As you recall yesterday, I made the statement, that as soon as that buyer realized that it was a blue tag tobacco and he turned to the warehousemen, “I can't buy,” why, because it's blue tag.”</text>
            <text syncTime="901.190" offset="3708113">The next buyer (Inaudible) order, too much moisture content the he said, “Yes that's right” and it was at that point that we stopped the sale and had the Government grader to come back and regrade that part of tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.094" offset="3767777">And he regraded it, certified that it's in good order and we tried to sell it and we couldn't sell it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.271" offset="5380472">The Federal Act Your Honor has as its prime purpose and it is set out in the act, it is set out in the legislative history, the creation of a uniform, classification, standard system of tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.498" offset="5461347">Now, the Act itself says, “Uniform standards for classification and inspection of tobacco, Section 2.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.807" offset="5506591">They repeat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.040" offset="5515577">The legislative history is build up with -- with the controversy between the proponents of the Act who claim that uniform standards of classification were necessary and the opponents who said, “No, this is a local problem, leave it up to the States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.725" offset="5610245">Congress in adopting the Act, adopted the argument of the proponents, and in fact as I said, put it into the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.947" offset="5655176">Now, the Secretary of Agriculture, under the authority granted him in the statute has established seven different classes of tobacco, the 27 different types, perhaps there's as many as 200 different grades et cetera down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.656" offset="5749948">He has also said, that the tobacco of the identical -- the characteristics, the same quality, and length, and moisture and so on and so forth shall be type identically, no mater where it may have been grown by the accidents of geography.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.515" offset="5853393">In other words, the tobacco grown on one side in Savannah, the River, the tobacco grown on the other side, if it has the same characteristics physically, it will have the same type whether that'd be 14 or 13 or 12 or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.292" offset="5920580">Now, the State of Georgia -- I mean, we continue one more point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.181" offset="5948061">The Act also has as its purpose not just the establishment of classification and standards in vacuum, but the communication of those standards to the buyer and the seller in order to bring some order to the chaos that range at -- ranged in the tobacco markets before 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.714" offset="6058193">Legislative history is full of descriptions of the way this, as my friend said, “The thousands of the tobacco farmers were --” well the words -- the one Congressman was subject to the wholesale of robbery by the few buyers and speculators mainly because the farmer did not know what type and grade of tobacco he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.844" offset="6178774">The buyers had their own systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.771" offset="6186506">The farmers might have a system and there was just mass confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.006" offset="6211375">The Congress, as I said, wanted this information of the classification of a particular lot tobacco to communicate to the buyer and the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.730" offset="6266337">It gave authority for this to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.944" offset="6283160">The Secretary set forth two requirements for the communication, one, that the type and the grade, now not just the grade but the type and the grade it says in the regulations, be on the warehouse ticket that is on the basket then secondly, that the auctioneer when he begins the auction of a lot of tobacco shall to publicly announce this information, so that the buyers and the sellers know what they are dealing with.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.630" offset="6493915">As I understand it, about an hour or so before the auction starts, one or more federal inspectors start to go down the road one-by-one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.750" offset="6550340">There maybe one inspector to a small warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.629" offset="6565909">There maybe as many as three or five in a large warehouse and they inspect each basket of tobacco; they pull out different leaves from different -- different areas within the basket to get what they consider, a represented its sample.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.484" offset="6637275">And then they make this determination, what is the type, what is the grade?</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.419" offset="6665070">Now, I might point out at this point that if an interest deportee, either the farmer or somebody who buys a tobacco is unhappy about the -- the typing and grading, he can ask the original inspector to re-inspect, to reclassify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.899" offset="6750960">He can also call in that inspector's supervisor who is -- probably in the same warehouse if -- if not his in the same locality to re-inspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.853" offset="6798817">And finally, there is an appeal, the procedure to the Tobacco Division of Agriculture Department and they have the field offices with some one designated to do it so that there would be a day or maybe two days to lay that, but as you say, this is all done before the -- the actual auction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.457" offset="6885230">At the time of the auction, this information is publicly announced.</text>

            <text syncTime="4494.287" offset="18080475">Maybe too many dollars and too few cents on some, but this -- there are two things that Georgia was interested in -- in protecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.542" offset="18113494">Type 14 as it revealed by page 115 of the record has special qualities, just like if a man goes to the grocery store and he wants some garlic salt instead of some onion salt, he will pay more for the garlic salt than he would for the onion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.998" offset="18175352">It won't fit in the recipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.329" offset="18184652">They -- they buy this tobacco as Type 14 and they ship it all over the world, 24 million pounds, the previous year of South Carolina tobacco had come on out in the market to the extent that they occupy 17% of our total market and thus Georgia was loosing its identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.900" offset="18258944">Now, the second and a very important thing is if we sell out tobacco in Georgia, Florida and Alabama loose, that is in tangled leaf form.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.429" offset="18297083">The other, the market sell it in tied form, they have to type by the in so that the machine -- the manufactures pick it up and can handle it manually.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.736" offset="18334281">Well with this tremendous influx of -- of the loose leaf tobacco that would normally be so typed, coming in to our market, we were threatened with the loss and as testified by an employee of the Department of Agriculture, we will -- we were threatened with a loss of our untied tobacco market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.060" offset="18411604">Now, that meant this to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.233" offset="18416306">It meant first by our sense of pound if we could possibly type and second the record demonstrates beyond question that because of the show occurrences, we couldn't typed our tobacco so it is we passed this Act, and who were the people that come here complaining?</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.650" offset="18481925">It's not the grower in South Carolina, the man who possibly could have full Type 14 tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.471" offset="18505226">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.516" offset="18509406">It's not him but it's the warehousemen who have built their tobacco warehouses based on being able to sell other than any product properly identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.097" offset="18551724">Now, it may well be Mr. Justice Whittaker that the reason the buyers wouldn't pay on blue tag tobacco, the same price they would pay for it in -- for the white tag is because they wanted to discourage this loose leaf influx too on account manufacturing culture but does not state of Georgia's activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.970" offset="18635212">That maybe -- it maybe the counsel for the warehousemen, and the Department have a case against them for conspiracy, but not to strike down an Act designed and passed to protect the vital industry, the largest single of cash crop in our home state, and not to be stricken down if this Court pleases on this acquisition that at some future date, possibly that could arise a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.503" offset="18741373">Now, on the only question of preemption, if you look at the act itself I think it would be different -- it will be shown (Inaudible), shows that Congress did not intent to preempt it as to type and identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.697" offset="18798111">If I -- well, let me shows the appointment of inspectors in cooperation with other people, other States with the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.898" offset="18822980">511 (m) shows cooperation, 511 (b) gives to the man, the Secretary the Power to designate a market or to fail to designate a market and certainly Congress would not had left undesignated markets and refuse the State to act and to protect though, 511 (g) shows that the ticket is only to show the grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.694" offset="18906154">Now, on page 18 and 19 of the Government brief, it's demonstrated that beyond question that the -- what the Federal Government is interested in is caliber not classification and that was what they were interested in and what they were interested in, identifying caliber B and grade and type B in classification when that -- this act was passed, because Congressmen have for the majority says, “We won't -- it would be a service to have this tobacco graded according to United States standards of quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.047" offset="19031542">Tobacco Inspection will bring a more uniform class and spoke -- of the advantages of having a standard grade and either the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.930" offset="19063097">They talked in times of grading and the only communication contained in the act itself required to be given under the Federal Act is -- that of a grade and Section 511 (i) (b) shows -- shows that 511 (i) (c) that shows the Commission for somebody else to put another type card on here just as long as it didn't say it's an official in the United States Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.066" offset="19219623">It makes it a misdemeanor for any person not an authorized inspector under this chapter.</text>
