            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Terris</label>
            <text syncTime="1069.852" offset="4382804">We think that these contentions are clearly part of petitioner's First Amendment arguments which he made very strongly at the executive sessions, repeated in the public session and all through the judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.283" offset="4432541">We agreed that the petitioner does raise the issue of probable cause under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.016" offset="4455424">And I think perhaps that's the difficulty that -- between the Government and Mr. Rauh.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.832" offset="4482696">We agreed that he raised the First Amendment contention including this probable cause, but we think that there's a substantial difference or there maybe a substantial difference between what the First Amendment requires and the Fourth Amendment requires, assuming as Mr. Rauh does that the Fourth Amendment would require the same re -- with the same kind of proof in order to call a witness before a congressional committee as it would be necessary for a police officer to make an arrest to research.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.956" offset="4587186">Now, of course, we don't, we don't agree with that statement of a substantive law.But if that -- but if Mr. Rauh is correct on that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.039" offset="4619577">Then there is a substantial difference, we believe, between the First Amendment and Fourth Amendment requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.260" offset="4648417">At the least, we think petitioners vague objection which does not even mentioned the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.757" offset="4670360">It's not the kind of clear unambiguous objection which this Court required in Deutch and Barenblatt cases in order to raise issues before a congressional committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.881" offset="4714872">I now would like to consider petitioner's contention assuming that he did properly raise the Fourth Amendment before the -- before the Subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.920" offset="4755101">In here, our argument is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.650" offset="4765968">First of all, we think that the Fourth Amendment does not apply the subpoenas to testify, while this Court is held in several cases that the Fourth Amendment does apply to subpoena duces tecum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.253" offset="4812361">We know of no case and petitioner has cited no case, indicating to certainly holding if the Fourth Amendment applied the subpoenas to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.788" offset="4850500">The Barenblatt, the Wilkinson and Braden cases, do mention probable cause, but read in context, it is perfectly clear that they mentioned probable cause as part of their discussion of the First Amendment and whether the Committee has a val -- has a valid legislative purpose.And -- and though petitioner cites numerous American and English cases, and the long history of arrest, searches and seizures, we think that they show merely as we of course agree that the Fourth Amendment applies to arrest and searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.004" offset="4991352">We think there's a marked difference between arrests and searches and testifying before a congressional committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.787" offset="5022490">And our second contention is that even if the Fourth Amendment did apply the subpoenas to testify, that it was not violated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.290" offset="5060524">It seems clear that if the Fourth Amendment applies at all, it requires the congressional committee to have considerably less information in order to subpoena a witness to -- either to testify or to produce documents than as required for officers to make an arrest or search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.514" offset="5137429">For if the results that a search or arrest is without basis, personal rights are very substantially injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.890" offset="5170970">On the other hand, if a congressional committee subpoenas a person who turns out to have no information on the subject which is under inquiry, the witness presumably will simply answer that he has no information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.099" offset="5223737">We do not to -- any vitally important interest is thereby violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.669" offset="5250069">This distinction between the standard of probable cause to be applied under the First Amendment, the subpoenas has a contrast to that applied to arrest and searches, has been recognized by this Court in at least two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.983" offset="5307329">In the Oklahoma Press Publishing Company case versus Walling, which is in 327 United States, this Court held that the Fourth Amendment does apply to subpoena duces tecum issued by executive agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.626" offset="5369919">But the Court held that probable cause is satisfied in that circumstance if “The investigation is authorized by Congress, is for a purpose Congress can order and the documents sought are relevant to the inquiry.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.386" offset="5444942">And a similar standard was applied to subpoena duces tecum -- to a subpoena duces tecum to appear before a grand jury in Hale v. Hankel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.214" offset="5480260">We think that there is no possible reason to apply a stricter standard to subpoenas to testify than to subpoenas duces tecum even if the Fourth Amendment applies to subpoenas to testify at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.339" offset="5532714">And if anything, the standards should be less strict as to subpoenas issued by a congressional committee than by an executive agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.306" offset="5572629">Now tying the standards which were laid down by this Court under the Fourth Amendment in the Oklahoma Press case to the situation here, the Barenblatt case establishes that Congress has the power to investigate Communist activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.790" offset="5638562">As we will show in the Liveright case, this investigation was within the authority conferred on the Internal Security Subcommittee by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.808" offset="5682552">And as I hope to show later, the questions which petitioner refused to answer were relevant, that is, they were pertinent to the investigation of Communist activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.328" offset="5728632">And for these reasons we think that if the Fourth Amendment applies at all, that it was satisfied in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.181" offset="13264123">There, the Court -- there the Court said, "In -- in discussing this issue, the one sentence which is on probable cause nor the petitioner's appearance, as a witness, follow from indiscriminate dragging of procedures, lacking improbable cause for belief that he possessed information which might be helpful to the Subcommittee."</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.527" offset="13365478">And then it dropped a Footnote to support this -- this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.660" offset="13381987">And the Footnote says, see page 124 and note 24.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.039" offset="13431515">The Court says the questions were relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.238" offset="13440293">We think the questions are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.612" offset="13449801">And then at note 24 -- note 24 contains a statement by the chairman that the evidence or information contained in the files of this Committee, some of them in the nature of evidence shows clearly that the witness has information about Communist activities in the United States of America, particularly while he attended the University of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.956" offset="13547186">So, that's what the Court relied on in Barenblatt for showing whatever cause must be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.048" offset="13571532">Now, that -- that statement is considerably less detailed than the statement that we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4285.667" offset="17246020">There was a paid informant, told a federal narcotics agent about a man and would -- it would've been probable cause if the informant had been there, but the agent got it hearsay from the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.535" offset="17301504">They arrested the man in the quest -- the agent then died so the (Voice Overlap) -- no, the informant died.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.795" offset="17326582">So the agent testified probable cause and this Court allowed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.447" offset="17345181">The difference between this and the Draper case is that there, the hear -- it was admitted that the hearsay existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.185" offset="17380080">Here, we deny that the hearsay exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.704" offset="17398157">We deny that the letter exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.370" offset="17408815">In other words, our case would be like Draper if we have gotten the letter and then said this letter is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.498" offset="17449357">We're sa -- we're saying the letter doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.599" offset="17461791">There isn't any letter, there's no proof the judge -- district judge wouldn't find there was a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.475" offset="17481226">The Government wouldn't produce it, so that in other words, in draper, the fact of that hearsay existed was not contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.732" offset="17514350">We are saying there is no evidence hearsay or otherwise.</text>
