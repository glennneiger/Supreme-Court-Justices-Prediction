            <text syncTime="13.351" offset="156818">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.112" offset="179806">As the Court recessed yesterday, I had been addressing myself to the refill provision, particularly in response to questions addressed to me by Mr. Justice Whittaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.692" offset="226095">I stated that Section 4 (a) of the ordinance requires refill, 4 (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="38.292" offset="256502">And I state also today that in addition to that reclaimant of refill there are criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.011" offset="287431">Now, I would state emphatically this morning to the Court as we have in the briefs that neither the refill provision nor the criminal sanctions is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.016" offset="343437">The judgment before the Court contains no affirmative mandate with respect to refill and it is true that the question would become a right one were the appellants to endeavor to utilize the remaining 18 acres of land.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="75.075" offset="403623">I couldn't find the judgment of the Supreme Court (Inaudible)</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Mattison</label>
            <text syncTime="78.806" offset="418565">It's on page 12, if my memory serves me correctly, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.132" offset="455868">Now, if the -- if the appellants consistent with their argument that there is nothing left to excavate on the 18 acres, do not endeavor to mine there, then plainly there is no reclaimant so far as this judgment is concerned that they refill.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.950" offset="523160">The refill provision we urge is a sensible one particularly so far as new pits are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.054" offset="551581">It was calculated to guarantee that when deep excavations in the ground be made, those excavations be on the abandonment of the excavation return to (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="122.542" offset="593586">This has the -- obvious and at one statutory purpose of eliminating the remaining deep pits in the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.793" offset="626500">We say that its sensible even here and as I urged yesterday that while at first blush, it may be a harsh reclaimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.158" offset="655966">If it be complied with, nonetheless, there would be a very substantial value far in excess of the cost of refill once the provision had been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.650" offset="701942">The Court may say indeed now that this is an oppressive, an oppressive -- or onerous reclaimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.194" offset="728168">If it is, I point to Section 11 of the ordinance which contains a separability provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.499" offset="757321">And I respectfully urged that should the Court reach the conclusion that refill constitutes an oppressive reclaimant that the ordinance be saved within the cases we've cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.953" offset="811133">I -- also before the conclusion of my argument had endeavored to address myself to a question which Mr. Justice Stewart asked me when he asked if the pit was here before the community was urbanized.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.061" offset="863587">And I answered correctly that the pit was in fact there.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.659" offset="881977">While it was there, it was there as the record shows that -- Mr. Justice Stewart, as a small excavation with some wood surely in 1930 not as -- has been urged as a 20-acre-lake with an average depth of 25 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.380" offset="948851">The point is that as Nassau County and particularly this township grew from 1929 to the most populous town in America today.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.898" offset="1242990">And they as much as said that this consideration, the community coming to the business activity would have no relevancy with that activity as here, constituted a noxious use or a hung to the community in brief a nuisance.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.811" offset="1442565">I would point to the trial court's determination on this record that even without the presumption; these provisions of the ordinance were eminently suited for the curtailment of the triple threat posed by the dangers to this community from ground and from surrounding homes caving in and from the penetration of he water table.</text>
