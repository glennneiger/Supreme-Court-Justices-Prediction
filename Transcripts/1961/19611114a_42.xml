            <text syncTime="17.118" offset="171865">Your Honor, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.733" offset="186284">The issue involved in this case is whether or not the State of Georgia is authorized to require the identification of flue-cured tobacco at the time that it has offered for sale in the Tobacco warehouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.894" offset="298924">Your Honor, there are two statutes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.315" offset="312613">One is the Federal Tobacco Inspection Act and the other is a 1960 Act of the Georgia general assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.725" offset="350229">We have conceded and admit that in the event that the Federal Act has preempted the fees, then the Georgia Act cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.918" offset="419088">We submit that the controlling issue in this case is whether or not the Congress by the Federal Tobacco Inspection Act and the regulations issued thereon which relate to the establishment and promotion of the use of standards of tobacco and how they may be determined as precluded to State of Georgia from protecting a product of that State, and revealing and requiring the revealing of the truth of the product at the time it is offered for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.883" offset="606856">The purpose of the Georgia Act is stated and at least four times in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.493" offset="649383">And that is, that it is to provide a positive means of identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.155" offset="679999">It sets forth right in the title of the Act in Section 1 in defining its -- the purpose, is found in Section 13 (a) and in Section 13 (e) of the Georgia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.747" offset="746350">Much has been said and will be argued before this Court as to the means and mechanics utilized by this Act in carrying out this stated purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.050" offset="795564">Insofar as those means relate to geographic areas production and the identification that is employed, it is submitted that these factors and mechanical mean are subservient to the basic issue and as to whether or not the State of Georgia is authorized to require or provide identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.949" offset="911130">In that, once it is determined, that this authority exists then the means and methods employed and the results thereof are placed in their proper perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.005" offset="971421">Again, we submit, that the basic issue is the authority of the State of Georgia to require the identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.899" offset="1006947">The Federal Tobacco Inspection Act was enacted by the Congress in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.975" offset="1039235">In Currin versus Wallace, there was an attack upon the constitutionality of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.188" offset="1080090">By leave of the Court, I would like to read an excerpt from that case and that it refers to a previous case wherein this Act was under construction, again from the State of Georgia, wherein the warehousemen had complained of the Georgia statute fixing the maximum fees that the warehousemen could charge for their services in selling the tobacco.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.593" offset="1253752">From this Court, U.S. Supreme Court, citation 306 U.S.1.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.821" offset="1274650">In Townsend versus Yeomans, 301 U.S. 441, we recently had under consideration the legislation of Georgia prescribing maximum charges for the services of Tobacco Warehousemen who conducted their business in a manner similar to that prevailing in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.484" offset="1361272">There, the warehousemen strongly insisted that they were engaged in interstate and foreign commerce as a tobacco sold on their floors was destined for interstate or foreign shipment, and hence that the State was without power to fix their fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.710" offset="1438177">They invoked the Federal Act in support of their contention, but we found nothing in the Federal Act which undertook to regulate the charges of warehousemen and hence we concluded that Congress had restricted its requirements and left the State free to deal with the matters not covered by the federal legislation and not inconsistent therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.919" offset="1551026">The authority of Congress to enact the Tobacco Inspection Act was not questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.020" offset="1571401">We do not question the authority here.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.703" offset="1614137">We submit that a reading of the cases shows that there was a limited purpose in the Congress enacting the Federal Tobacco Inspection Act, and that is that the Act was enacted so as to remove the contusion and the elimination of doubt and manipulation in the Tobacco Act throughout the use of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.526" offset="1745481">It is stated that is -- it is to provide a uniform method for determining for standards and for the classification of tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.199" offset="1796159">In this connection, the lower court cited Section 3 of the Federal Act in support of its opinion that there should be scheme of federal regulations so pervasive as to leave no room for state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.762" offset="1858435">This section authorizes the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to investigate the sorting, handling, condition, inspection and marketing of tobacco from time to time, and to establish standards for tobacco by which its type, grade, size, condition, or other characteristics may be determined which standards shall be the official standards of the United States, thereafter follow other provisions of this Section relative to the date that the standard shall become effective and authorizing amendments and modification thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.083" offset="2043695">Section 5 of the Federal Act provides a manner by which the Secretary is authorized to designate those option markets where tobacco is bought and sold at option.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.533" offset="2097507">It specifically requires than no such market may be designated and subsequent to a referendum where it is required that at least two thirds of the growers' voting favor the designation of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.054" offset="2171591">This section also authorizes the Secretary to temporarily suspend the inspection and certification requirements at any designated market for the named reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.606" offset="2221746">This same Section provides that nothing contained in the Act shall be construed to prevent transactions in tobacco -- at markets not designated by the Secretary or at designated markets where the inspection and certification requirements have been suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.768" offset="2318399">The declaration of purpose contained in the Federal Act, which is Section 2, states the purposes of the Act and includes a statement that without uniform standards of classification and inspection, evaluation is subject to price manipulation and other evils submit that the Federal Tobacco Inspection Act is by its terms an authorization to the Secretary to perform named acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.960" offset="2435218">The determination of tobacco by grade is strict.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.783" offset="2462490">Authorization is given to the Secretary in broad language.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.238" offset="2484328">It is submitted by the -- that the Act itself, the construction of the Act by this Court, show that the Act does not precludes state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.269" offset="2532498">Under the Federal Act, the Secretary had determined and defined four basic types of tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.875" offset="2574921">This is flue-cured tobacco, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.394" offset="2588923">Type 14 under the Federal Act is defined as follows: “That type of flue-cured tobacco, commonly known as Southern Flue-cure or New Belt of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama, produced principally in the southern section of Georgia and to some extent, in Florida and Alabama."</text>
            <text syncTime="645.730" offset="2686307">One of the stipulation that was entered into by the parties and as part of the record in this case is as follows, it is stipulation number 4 on page 27 of the record, “And an official standard of the United States the Federal Government has, under the Federal Tobacco Inspection Act, designated types 11, 12, 13 and 14, known as flue-cured tobacco, and has designated as Type 14 tobacco only flue-cured tobacco grown in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama”.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.016" offset="2843460">We respectfully submit to the Court that the type of the production of Type 14 tobacco is in and of itself relatively new when compared to the production of tobacco in other years.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.884" offset="2914931">Of the four types, three of these types, contain language that give leeway that the principal area of production is in designated areas in the States of the Carolina's and Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.223" offset="2988283">Now, the language employed in defining Type 14 goes to recognize that it is a relatively new area of production and we submit that under this definition, under the federal definition of Type 14, that it cannot be produced in any other area.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.224" offset="3084309">The record in this case, the testimony of the witnesses supports this statement.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="750.766" offset="3106461">Well, are there differences in characteristics depending on State where the Type 14 is grown?</text>

            <text syncTime="756.558" offset="3129553">Your Honor, we submit that the testimony in this record shows that you can take plants from one bed in Florida -- plant bed in Florida or South Georgia and plant it in the different production areas and that you will have a resulting product that has distinct characteristics, its nicotine content would vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.450" offset="3241148">The aroma, the burning qualities, physical properties and chemical content, and while we're there, Your Honor, the production of Type 14, the qualities of Type 14, as such that it is in demand not because of its superiority, not because any other grade is inferior, but because it has definite known characteristics that those in the marketplace in buying tobacco, desire to have that product when they can identify it as such.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.804" offset="3442604">We have -- a question of geography has been quite involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.682" offset="3466115">We submit here that geography standing alone is not a controlling issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="847.642" offset="3493909">But what I want -- what I -- I know absolutely nothing about it or from where it is, but I gather that when the Federal Government says that this is Type 14 and permits them all to be legal and sold together, that this is on some basis of common characteristics of the tobacco without regard to where it's grown, am I wrong about that?</text>

            <text syncTime="870.737" offset="3586278">There is an area of dispute there, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.311" offset="3596622">We take the position that the Federal Government under the Federal Tobacco Inspection Act has set up definite areas of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.704" offset="3642180">And the record in this case reveals that they will not recognize as true to type any tobacco produced outside the type -- producing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.831" offset="3690663">Now as to the individual state, the Type 14, as I mentioned here, is produced in the three state area of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama with the principal area of production be in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.184" offset="3764120">Now, Type 13 is defined as certain in areas of South Carolina, then we have Type 12 and 11 coming on up North into the Virginia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.827" offset="3818663">These areas are defined under the Federal Tobacco Inspection Act, and the testimony of Mr. Williams in this record shows that the Department will not recognize as true to type any tobacco produced outside of that area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1521.680" offset="6190059">Well, the difference, Your Honor, is that heretofore, but prior to the enactment of the 1960 Georgia statute that type was for all purposes -- all practical purposes determined by the place of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.487" offset="6257351">Now, there is a reason why the State of Georgia had to move in order to protect its product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.606" offset="6293817">Historically, Type 14 is the only tobacco that is sold in loose-leaf or tangle-leaf form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.595" offset="6325791">In other words, we can sell the tobacco in these three state areas, and north of the Savannah River, it must be tied in order to be sold, tied and hinged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.407" offset="6373021">Now, many factors are involved, but here are some of the important ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.705" offset="6394232">Our tobacco produced -- matures early.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.257" offset="6412413">We -- the marketing season opens along the latter part of July of each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.273" offset="6436446">There is not the times or sufficient time in order to enable the producer in Georgia to tie his tobacco and get it on the market at -- at this early marketing date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.032" offset="6499453">Now, this marketing date they open up begin when the new area started in the production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.445" offset="6533204">They move down in order to market it and permitted the marketing of this tobacco in this tangle-leaf form or loose-leaf form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.411" offset="6569044">And then, while they were selling them, they could utilize their personnel, the trained warehouseman and other personnel in there to market this product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.066" offset="6607600">This crop in Georgia, and then use the same personnel and move up the production area in an orderly manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.296" offset="6640515">Now, this -- the amount of loose-leaf tobacco, which is your Type 14, was relatively fixed, and then we have began -- they began the movement of other than type 14, the Carolina tobacco to be specific, which we say is -- under the Type 13 -- under the federal law is Type 13, 11, and 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.772" offset="6750438">They initially began to move the tobacco that could not be processed or tied to move this tobacco down into the State of Georgia and sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.271" offset="6800488">Now, this amount of tobacco that was brought into the State remained fairly stable until we started to getting more mobility and for other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.430" offset="6849076">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.367" offset="6852838">We had a steady step-up of the tobaccos that were brought over into the State of Georgia to the point that we reached about 22 million pounds in 1959.</text>

            <text syncTime="2604.627" offset="10521893">Mr. Chief Justice, I came up here to argue as a lawyer, but I think may we all argue as tobacco farmers, it just so happens that all the counsel by appellees are tobacco farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.977" offset="10571316">And the blue tags you have before you, were not sent up with the record although somewhere introduced in the trial of the case through an oversight, they were not made part of the record, and at the brief of counsel on both sides, we would use the blue tags and the white tags in the oral argument, and our aptitude maybe have the Court in seeing the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.707" offset="10718229">It takes in its call on a blue tag over onto your right hand side grade on the blank line there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.832" offset="10762742">Immediately before all tobacco is sold on the tobacco markets, official grader of United States Department of Agriculture grades this tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.152" offset="10807986">And he would write the grade to that particular pile of tobacco on that card, just for example, we might say that he puts down that B6F, which is one of the 168 grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.054" offset="10891577">This chart, the official schedule for loan by the -- the U.S. standard grade, fresh to the farmers by the warehousemen and all, you'll notice about halfway down, your left-hand column, B6F $46.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.114" offset="10975796">That is the loan value that the Government -- the stabilization program will make the farmer in the event that the tobacco buyers don't bid that much for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.444" offset="11025115">They will buy that tobacco on the government grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.978" offset="11043297">Of course, this stabilization program had to buy practically all the blue tag tobacco that was sold in Georgia for those two days operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.669" offset="11086033">If the Government agency is willing to take the tobacco under the loan value, based on the Government grade will cost the tobacco companies should be, because eventually, those companies turn around and buy that tobacco from the stabilization program and fill the demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.247" offset="11164400">As to the price deferential, I think that was one of the questions that was (Inaudible) some of these gentlemen for $18 per hundred pounds difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.465" offset="11225213">We don't know why it happened but it happened, maybe it raised it a lot to cover, but as it pointed out in the record on the Swainsboro market, the first day, the first 11 rows of tobacco that was sold were Georgia tobacco, white tag tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.500" offset="11313403">I have been following the market, selling tobacco from my father's farm since 1928, and several years of (Inaudible) Georgia, that particular market opened as good as any market I've ever been on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.987" offset="11383306">The first pile of blue tag tobacco that was sold in Swainsboro, Georgia that day was on the 11th row.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.784" offset="11418520">I stationed myself at that particular part of tobacco because we anticipated that there were going to be trouble, and my client had asked me to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.260" offset="11472436">When the tobacco auctioneers come along, you probably seen the commercial to how they conduct the sale, when the auctioneer chant in his unknown tongue, the warehousemen opens a bid, these are the first men who makes bid, then the auctioneer takes up his bid and he turns the tobacco from R.J. Reynolds to Liggett &amp; Myers American tobacco and trying to up that bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.105" offset="11567835">They spent about eight seconds on each pile of tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.507" offset="11581419">Each buyer has a little signal, stretch his ear, something like that that he and the auctioneer communicate with and a man walks along and write it on the ticket and he will write on the face of that ticket 44 cents per pound rattles, put it back on the pile of tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.104" offset="11651741">That first blue tag pile that was sold in Swainsboro that day was knocked off for $61 a pound, that's a $61 a hundred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.644" offset="11689984">That was then 4 or 5 cents of the highest price that was paid for -- in a tobacco on that market practically during the whole season.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.849" offset="11730735">65, 66 and 67 were the very best prices often.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.511" offset="11769396">They moved on to the second pile of tobacco before the tobacco buyer realized what had happened that he had bought a pile of blue tag tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.578" offset="11805654">He stopped the sale, turned to the warehouseman and says, “I can't buy it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.554" offset="11833553">Well, I was standing by the warehouseman and he asked why.</text>

            <text syncTime="2980.308" offset="12024560">Then, another buyer points to him and says, “No, it's in too high odor”, and that's when he says “Yes, it is in too high odor”, but he did make a statement first, “If blue tag, I can't buy it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.602" offset="12073775">The warehouseman turned to me and said, “What do I do?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.064" offset="12083597">And I said, “Stop the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.543" offset="12093524">Let's get the Government grade it back here and have it re-grade it and see if it isn't too high odor”.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.316" offset="12804681">We've arguing for our share of tobacco for my father many years of what it's worth as a form of agriculture here in Washington, and in-charge of the tobacco division and the marketing division.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.444" offset="12861106">And I remember sitting in as a little high school boy in campuses where he would be arguing with these other states about we weren't getting enough of our tobacco and they were arguing we were getting too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.157" offset="12899976">So this thing goes way back.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.577" offset="12989628">We don't have enough volume to survive in a competitive business like tobacco auction business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3240.971" offset="13067264">But the North Carolinian and South Carolinian warehousemen hated to this North Carolinian and South Carolinian tobacco going to Georgia to be sold, and they want it stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.827" offset="13118673">In turn, some of our South Georgia boys warehousemen didn't care too much about whether we continue to operate or not because if we could not operate this Carolina tobacco, then we'd have to do it as I have done many times leave our farm and go and spend two nights sleeping on a pile of tobacco truck waiting to get it sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.691" offset="13214177">Where today, I can take it in this morning and get it sold that afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.105" offset="13235806">As I say gentlemen, I went out of the record on that, and I'm sure that the counsel will -- take it -- accept this, to what I have said.</text>
