            <label>Mr. Donald A. Schmechel</label>
            <text syncTime="20.955" offset="187225">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.785" offset="206555">We are concerned here in these two cases which are consolidated in a single petition before the Court with two aspects of the bankruptcy law which relate also to the laws of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.269" offset="260472">In the two cases, both the Harris case which is a Chapter 10 pre-organization under the bankruptcy statute, and the Simonson case which is an ordinary bankruptcy proceeding, in both of these cases, there is presently issue as to whether or not a tax penalty which is a subject of a lien, whether the lien be recorded, whether the notice of lien be recorded prior to bankruptcy or not recorded, is a valid tax lien with respect to the penalty so that it can be recovered despite the language in 57j of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.669" offset="409997">This part -- this issue which involves and could determine both the Simonson and the Harris case, will be argued by me.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.469" offset="441240">There is a second issue which is present only in the Simonson case, an ordinary bankruptcy case, primarily arising under Section 70c of the Bankruptcy Act and Section 6323 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code and basically it is the question as to whether or not a trustee in bankruptcy is a judgment creditor or entitled to exercise some of the rights of a judgment creditor as against an unrecorded tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.891" offset="562970">In the Simonson case the notice of a tax lien had not been recorded prior to the inception of the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.921" offset="595048">This second issue which is present only in the Simonson case, would be argued by my colleague and who is the counsel in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.042" offset="631515">Now briefly the facts of these two cases should be observed because they do have some light upon both the general policy of the bankruptcy statute and the effect which should be given to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.631" offset="681880">The Simonson case as indicated is an ordinary bankruptcy wherein upon liquidation of the assets, the trustee realized some $8000 which was sufficient to pay all tax claims and expenses of the administration and prior to the filing of the bankruptcy proceeding as indicated, the Government had a tax lien represented by its assessment procedures but no notice of the tax lien was on file.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.893" offset="790967">The United States filed its claim in the Simonson case as a secured creditor, relying on the lien, both as to the principle, post petition interest and as to penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.768" offset="838405">The trustee paid both the entire principle of the taxes involved and all pre-petition interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.586" offset="865677">The trustee and the court below disallowed post petition interest and some $1442 in penalties and it is this amount which is involved in the Simonson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.515" offset="917400">The Harris case somewhat by contrast is a proceeding under Chapter 10 of the Bankruptcy Act, a corporate reorganization of a small operating telephone company.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.772" offset="958464">Prior to the filing of the -- initially a Chapter 11 proceeding which was soon converted into the Chapter 10 proceeding, various tax liens against the bankrupt -- or insolvent telephone company had been filed, notices of the tax lien were on file unlike in the Simonson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.447" offset="1033174">Also prior to the inception of the proceeding as appears in the record, the taxpayer had made an offer in compromise to the Government as against to all these taxes in the sum of some $57,000 of which $40,000 was actually being held pursuant to that offer in compromise at the time that the Chapter 10 proceeding was instituted.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.297" offset="1120528">Would you excuse me please, I did not understand -- did you say that the tax lien had been filed in the Harris case in advance of the bankruptcy?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald A. Schmechel</label>
            <text syncTime="266.239" offset="1168280">That is correct Your Honor in the Harris case some year or two before the inception of the reorganization, the notices of the tax lien were recorded and filed.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Donald A. Schmechel</label>
            <text syncTime="277.787" offset="1214568">Now in the Harris case, the Government came in, as shown in the record, and again filed a claim as the secured creditor, claiming not only the principle of their taxes slightly less than $57,000 but claiming also pre-petition interest, post petition interest, and penalties with no mention being made with the $40,000 then being held by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.584" offset="1313729">During the course of the proceedings as the record shows, the Court finally ordered the Government to return the $40,000 to the trustee, and subsequently in the course of the Chapter 10 proceedings a plan of reorganization was submitted in the manner contemplated by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.232" offset="1392306">The plan of reorganization provided as part of its very equitable and just provisions that a payment of $57,000 representing all of the principle of the taxes to United States should be paid in cash to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.627" offset="1453850">The United State acting to the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 199 of Chapter 10 declined that to acquiesce in the acceptance of that amount which would have been payment in full of the principle of the taxes, the Court then proceeded as permitted on Chapter 10 to confirm and approve the plan and make separate provision in effect with respect to any claims of about which there was a dispute including this particular one with reference to the penalties and post petition interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.706" offset="1574222">As a result of this, the trustee filed objections to the claim of the United States for penalties and to the claim of the Unites States for post petition interest and the referee in the District Court both granted the contention of the trustee, disallowing any penalties and disallowing any post petition interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.879" offset="1670875">The United States appealed to the Ninth Circuit only with respect to the issue of penalties, not seeking any review of the issue on post petition interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.764" offset="1714448">Now as a result of the action taken in the proceedings, of course and the order of the court below, the District Court directing payment of the full principle the taxes of $57,000, they have been paid so that in both the Simonson and then the Harris case, all principle of the taxes have been paid and any pre petition interest that was involved has been paid or would be paid as provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.430" offset="1809115">The only issue before the court is then with respect to the -- whether or not the penalties can be recovered in both of those instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.336" offset="1848717">Now as to both of these issues the issue on penalties present in both cases and the issue with respect to the status of the trustee as a judgment creditor, neither of these issues have been directly before this Court before as far as counsel can discover.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.806" offset="1914546">Now turning first to the argument on the question of penalties which applies as indicated to both cases, in our -- it is our contention that a straight, simple statutory interpretation of Section 57j and 67b of the Bankruptcy Act is possible, and that it gives a reasonable effect to both of those sections and prohibits the recovery of a tax penalty as part of a lien in both the Simonson case and in the Harris case.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.288" offset="2044531">57j is a fairly short provision and is set forth in petitioner's brief and in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.514" offset="2069400">It provides briefly as follows that debts owing to the United States or any state or any subdivision as a penalty or forfeiture shall not be allowed except for the amount of pecuniary loss sustained by the act, transaction or proceeding are to which the penalty or forfeiture arose with reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby and such interests may have accrued in the amount of such loss according to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.115" offset="2163858">There is nothing in the record and there has never been any contention in either of the Simonson case or the Harris case by the Government that any -- particular loss has been occasioned by reason of which latter part of this section would have any applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.224" offset="2224253">It is the contention in effect to the United States and once a tax lien arises, whether or not the notice of a tax lien is on file that the associated tax penalties merge with and in effect become a part of the tax, that consequently under Section 67b of the Bankruptcy Act, such a lien is preserved not only with respect to the principle of a tax but with respect to the penalties, and despite the express language which I have cited to the Court in Section 57j.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.274" offset="2348492">Now tax penalties of course do not compensate for a loss sustained by the United States and of course none is claimed here under this special provision of the statute as indicated and it is once apparent the penalties are not allowable of course in the case of ordinary tax claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.145" offset="2407946">It has long been decided since 1924 in New York versus Jersawit which is cited in our brief that where there is not a lien -- where there is not a lien supporting the tax that no penalty can be recovered in the face of Section 57j.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.626" offset="2465834">The Government harbor -- asserts that in the case of a lien tax where there is an adequate lien prior to bankruptcy, that Section 67b in effect bars the bankruptcy court from it -- from examining this otherwise invalid component of a tax claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.104" offset="2531767">Section 67b of the Bankruptcy Act is directed to the preservation of statutory liens including tax liens as against other provisions of the Bankruptcy Act applicable to other categories of liens and reads in part briefly as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.688" offset="2594147">The provisions of Section 60 of this Act to the contrary notwithstanding statutory liens or taxes and debts owing to the United States or to any state maybe valid against the trustee even though arising or perfected while debtor is insolvent and within four months prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.125" offset="2671888">Section 60 referred to as the court may recall, deals with preferences and also with various requirements as to recording in another that certain other types of liens may be perfected and preferences may not be recovered and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.908" offset="2726954">Now, since -- even though than a perfected lien may exist to support a penalty of the time of adjudication in bankruptcy, whether by virtue of Section 67b or otherwise, it is our contention that the bankruptcy court is not free to disregard the imperfect substance of the obligation upon which the lien claim is based.</text>

            <text syncTime="680.030" offset="2823502">We'll recess now. (Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_a_schmechel" startTime="688.223" stopTime="1722.888">
            <label>Mr. Donald A. Schmechel</label>
            <text syncTime="688.223" offset="2856312">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.841" offset="2866761">I was in the midst of my summary argument with respect to the penalty issue which is common to both the Harris and the Simonson cases and had cited to the Court portions of the two statutes involved 57j and 67b, both of which are cited to be full in the briefs of the Government and the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.935" offset="2947114">A comparison of these two Sections 67b and 57j, in our opinion, discloses no congressionally intention that the two should be construed in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.812" offset="2990582">The provisions of 67b as I previously indicated are framed primarily to accept certain otherwise belated liens including tax liens from the defeating operation of Section 60 and there's no apparent reason in the language of the statute itself why Section 67b need become disharmonious with the clear prohibition against the allowance of tax penalties which is contained in Section 57j.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.732" offset="3102281">Even if there were, it is still a principal statutory construction as we have argued in our brief that specific terms covering a given subject matter will prevail over general language of another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.319" offset="3160691">And as also been held that where a statute general in terms is a later enactment in a special statute, the special statute will control unless repealed by necessary implication, as indicated in the briefs both for the Government and petitioner, Section 57j the special statute which is here involved has existed substantially in its present form since the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 while 67b is a creation of the Chandler Act of 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.426" offset="3273122">In the absence of a clear indication to the contrary in the language of 67b there is no reason why this Court should find or hold that these two sections must be read in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.542" offset="3325576">In addition and for an equally important reason, the bankruptcy court of course sits as a court of equity, and it has an affirmative duty to permit and duty to avoid any inequitable distribution of the bankrupt estate which is conflict with the clearly defined policy of the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.454" offset="3397151">That policy under Section 57j and many other pertinent provisions of the Bankruptcy Act is aimed to preserve the bank of the state from the imposition of penalties which would tend to further away its assets and to bring about any equitable distribution of the bankrupt estate among creditors holding just demands based upon adequate consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.381" offset="3476877">As a court of equity, a bankruptcy court also has power and obligation to look behind the bare fact of a lien claim and determine the provability or invalidity in bankruptcy of the indebtedness or claim which is in subject of the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.336" offset="3536750">Thus in Pepper versus Litton which is cited in our brief, the -- this Court held that the -- that a bankruptcy court to which a claim based on a judgment lien of a state court is presented for allowance has full authority to determine the validity and priority of the claim underlying the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.419" offset="3613027">It would seem to us beyond argument that a court which is vested with jurisdiction to look behind a judgment of another court to question the probability or provability of an underlying claim is equally empowered to determine the provability of a debt secured as here by an ex parte statutory lien for taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.967" offset="3691290">Accordingly we think the claim for penalties in both the Simonson and the Harris case must file -- must fall with the underlying debt itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.798" offset="3722533">The lien cannot in our opinion directly lift into an area of provability and indebtedness by origin in nature which is unprovable directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.983" offset="3759313">A penalty no matter what it may be called by the Government in the various cases where this issue has come up still remains a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.675" offset="3790033">To hold otherwise would inequitably punish general creditors as well as creditors who were entitled to various priorities under Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, creditors who have contributed a consideration directly or indirectly to the bankrupt estate by enforcing a punitive provision directed at the bankrupt, namely the punitive provisions of the penalty and in effect levying them upon or collecting them from the creditors and others who in good faith have dealt with the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.661" offset="3906017">We think that the purpose and mandate of the Bankruptcy Act generally is and foremost to accomplish a fair and just apportionment of available assets among the victims of the bankrupt's insolvency.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.176" offset="3952097">The application of 60 -- of 57j under these circumstances is in aid of that purpose and ought not to be circumvented in the absence of a clear direction in the language of the statute itself to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.080" offset="4003715">Neither the Bankruptcy Act itself nor the Internal Revenue Laws, we suggest, are should be construed or can be construed to give any such direction or light as would require that the penalty provisions of 57j be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.024" offset="4067453">Now in essence this the argument of petitioner with respect to the penalty issue come to both cases and as the Court will note from my brief this is basically the position which the -- which was taken both by the Fourth and Fifth Circuits unanimously on this issue and was taken in a very searching dissent by Judge Simons in the Commonwealth of Kentucky case which is cited on page 11 of our brief and I would like to read just a portion of Judge Simons' descent in the Commonwealth Kentucky case which was cited with approval by the Fifth Circuit in the Philips case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.916" offset="4223039">Judge Simons said that, and incidentally the Commonwealth of Kentucky case involved a state penalty rather than a federal one, Judge Simons said a lien is a charge upon property for the payment or discharge of a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.371" offset="4276851">It is therefore dependent upon the existence, the amount of, and the provability of the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.151" offset="4295973">The debt has been paid or otherwise expunged as per fraud or by set off, the lien is extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.503" offset="4317393">An in court lien does not write into security until a debt comes into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.876" offset="4334843">In case of private liens it may be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.202" offset="4344142">It may be impermissible to prove a debt because of the statute of frauds or the running of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.066" offset="4371623">“I am unable” said Judge Simons to see how a lien however valid it may be under state law will breathe life into an unprovable debt in the face of Section 57j which deals expressly with debts owing to any state or subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.856" offset="4426794">The two provisions of the Bankruptcy Act are not irreconcilable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.572" offset="4441631">The tax lien is preserved to the extent that it does not include a penalty, and the tax debt other than the amount of a penalty is provable to the extent the debt is not provable in bankruptcy the lien sees these for all practical purposes to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.320" offset="4492622">Judge Simons then went on to point out the lack of uniformity which you would have in the -- applicability the Bankruptcy Act throughout the country as different states had varying provisions with respect to this and if the law or otherwise and as he argued it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.569" offset="4561690">Now that is the -- is basically the position with respect to the penalty issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.805" offset="4582588">We submit that the language of 57j and 67b can be read together and when so read together in a manner indicated, we suggest that it comes out with a result which is eminently equitable and fair to all of the parties in bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.536" offset="4645491">I think the Court might also take note of the fact that -- and that this is peculiarity of problem in all bankruptcies as indicated in our petition and brief in -- as the Government admitted in its answering memorandum, some $2.5 million approximately and some thousands of cases are currently pending alone involving this penalty issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.254" offset="4740368">And the suggested reading of the two Sections of the statute which we find harmonious would not really seriously affect the Government because it would leave them with respect to their lien for taxes as to entire principal of their taxes, it would leave undisturbed in a pre petition interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.597" offset="4813720">The question of post petition interest which the Government still contends for in many cases as they did in these cases below is not yet before this Court, but we suggest that the effect of the reading which we have urged upon the Court, 57j and 67 is not to completely do away with any distinction in the Bankruptcy Act between lien claims and non lien claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.760" offset="4898461">It leaves the lien claims, a valid and subsisting with respect to the principal of the taxes but it does give full effect as it should to the letter and spirit of 57j to look into that tax lien and to the extent the tax lien includes a penalty to knock out that penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.422" offset="4977037">Now I'd like to turn very briefly to part of the judicial history of this problem which I think has bearing and particularly upon the argument which the Government has made as to the probable intention of Congress and the amendments to the Chandler Act in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.549" offset="5045582">This issue first arose appropriately enough in the Ninth Circuit from which we come with these cases with the decision in Knox-Powell-Stockton in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.616" offset="5085811">That was the First Circuit Court decision with respect to this penalty issue and curiously enough and as a matter of history, in that case it was a California tax penalty which was involved and the United States Government at that time in that case was contending for the very position which petitioners here are contending for today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.322" offset="5160626">In that case it was of course to the advantage of the United States to try and upset the penalty which the State of California was trying to collect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.057" offset="5191555">They were unsuccessful in that decision in a fairly short decision insofar as it related to this penalty issue and the Knox-Powell-Stockton case in 1939 was the first case on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.914" offset="5238993">The issue next came up in the Commonwealth of Kentucky case in 1943 in the Sixth Circuit to which I've already referred and that case which is a very brief page and a half decision again involving a state tax penalty rather that a federal tax penalty both the Knox-Powell-Stockton and the Commonwealth of Kentucky cases were state tax penalties, in a very brief page and a half decision, the Commonwealth of Kentucky case the majority of the two in effect cited in Section 57, they quoted very briefly from Knox-Powell-Stockton and then in effect recited the usual matter that with respect to giving due deference to the opinion of other Circuits in trying to maintain uniformity particularly in tax matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.661" offset="5405968">The dissent by Justice Simons is much more in detail and as a much clearer in lengthier analysis of the problem actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.031" offset="5447450">The only other decision which occurred prior to 1952 and as the Government points out, Section 57 was amended with respect to some minor matters the only other decision was In re Burch which was a 1948 District Court case in Kansas, which went the -- went against the Government in favor of petitioners, noting among other things that since Knox-Powell-Stockton had been decided, that the Chandler Act had been amended and accordingly they didn't think that the Knox-Powell-Stockton decision was binding and of course it was in another Circuit as well and in addition they apparently were impressed by the dissenting opinion of Judge Simons, so as of 1952 when Congress was making its minor amendments to the statute contrary to the suggestion made by the Government and its brief, the law if anything was at perhaps unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.239" offset="5652355">Knox-Powell-Stockton and Commonwealth of Kentucky with a divided decision in that second case had indicated only with respect to state taxes that penalties were recoverable, but on the other hand of the -- at least this one District Court case said -- indicated to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.441" offset="5725184">Now after 1952 a series of decisions came, first of all in the Tenth Circuit, the Grimland case which is cited in all of the briefs and later in the same Circuit, the Mighell case, both of which first in 1953 and 1959 followed the lead of Knox-Powell-Stockton, but again without any very lengthy discussions both in the Grimland case and in the Mighell case, the Tenth Circuit in effect more or less relied upon the earlier lead of Knox-Powell-Stockton and Commonwealth of Kentucky with very little discussion of the impact of this penalty problem and no reference in the Grimland case for example to the Gardner case which I'll refer to shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.037" offset="5883486">When the matter came up in 1959 in the Tenth Circuit in the Mighell case, and by that time of course the -- at least either the Phillips or the Harrington case in the Fifth and Fourth Circuit had been decided and the Court failed -- said, “We will not reconsider this issue because now it is apparent there is split between the courts which can only be resolved by this -- by the Supreme Court”, so actually they didn't reexamine the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.876" offset="5974915">In the Harrington and the Philips case however, the Harrington case in the Fourth Circuit and the Philips in the Fifth as I previously indicated, they basically took exactly the position which petitioners are urging here today which allows for an interpretation of both 57 and -- 57 and the other Sections of the statute and reconciles them and throws out the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.621" offset="6057880">I think it might be of interest also to note that in connection with the Philips case and the Harrington case both of which were decided adversely to the Government, and no certiorari was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.777" offset="6098526">And in the Philips case for example the penalty which was involved in that case of some $2000 was even a penalty on a tax which had been paid by taxpayer some six months prior to the bankruptcy and the Government was in the position of coming in to assert and try to collect the penalty in the bankruptcy with respect to a tax which have been paid long before the bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.858" offset="6182849">Then in addition after these decisions of the Harrington and Philips case, a number of District Court cases followed and actually at the present time District Court cases in the Third, Second and Eighth Circuit as cited in our briefs have sustained the position taken by petitioner and only one in affect or two, but one of those is in a Circuit where it was already decided to followed the position of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.631" offset="6273860">Now I mention this only because I think it brings out two points. First of all that it is not at all clear as the Government has suggested that when Congress amended the Section 57j in 1952 that it somehow must have taken recognition of the fact that the law was in the state and was apparently happy to leave it in that state with penalties being recoverable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.264" offset="6368423">The decisions were by no means consistent and they could just as well have concluded that the law in this area of bankruptcy as in others was a little bit in doubt and there was certainly opportunity that a judicial decision would straighten this out without the necessity of actual change in the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.374" offset="6444910">Of course subsequently Congress did amend the statute with respect to making penalties non-recoverable very specifically but that as the reports indicate that was -- was vetoed and accordingly did not change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.137" offset="6503946">I would like to close then very briefly with only two comments with respect to the Gardner case and the Goggin case, both of which had been cited by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.779" offset="6542503">The Gardner case, we have cited in our brief as authority for the fact that was the unanimous decision with the Court speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas in 1946, in which the Court discussed in a railroad reorganization this whole issue as to whether or not penalties were recoverable and the -- and other issues and specifically the Court discusses and recognizes that the -- that the bankruptcy court in this case, a reorganization court can look into what -- what lies behind a tax lien, there was a tax lien of New Jersey, and among other things if they find it in includes penalties which are not permissible or not recoverable, to look into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.070" offset="6719613">Now we concede as we do in our brief that the Gardner case is dicta because of the procedural manner in which in came up but nevertheless we suggest that it is very persuasive dicta and it deals and discusses in considerable detail and with specific mention of tax penalties, this very question with which we are concerned here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.325" offset="6796622">Now the Government has made much in its brief, and in the other Courts of the Goggin case which followed some two years later by the very same court, and where the court speaking through Mr. Justice Burton has some general discussion about the status of lien claims with which we do not disagree, but I like to remind the Court only of this one additional point about the Goggin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.752" offset="6886379">If the Gardner case was dicta, certainly the Goggin case was equally so for what that is worth because in a footnote on page 3 of 100 page -- of footnote 3 on page 124 of the decision, we find the following language, there is no issue here as to the amount of penalties or interest included in the collector's claim for taxes or as to the data -- date to which interest on such claim should be computed, in fact the amount of money involved -- excuse me Your Honor --</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.537" offset="7029530">In fact in the Goggin Case the total amount of money which the bankruptcy court had was less than the principle amount of the taxes which the Government -- which were being claimed so it really never was an issue as to whether or not any penalties were to be included or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.687" offset="7090134">And the real issue of the Goggin case which is decided as they say by the same Court that decided the Gardner case, the real issue there was simply the one whether or not where the Government had taken possession as they have there a personal property prior to the bankruptcy proceeding being started whether or not under those circumstances with possession prior to bankruptcy whether the Government would prevail as against certain wage claimants under the priority Section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.559" offset="7201625">And the Court held we think quite properly on a very narrow issue that the rights were determined as of the time of the filing of bankruptcy and that as of that time the Government having possession of the personal property that notwithstanding the fact they later came in and allowed the trustee to sell it that they were not to be placed below the wage claimants under Section 64 of the Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred A. Granata</label>
            <text syncTime="1808.904" offset="7339029">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.303" offset="7352613">I am concerned here only with the one issue found in the Simonson case and that issue stated briefly is whether the language of Section 70c of the Bankruptcy Act gives the trustee in bankruptcy the status of a judgment creditor so that under Section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code, he prevails to invalidate an unrecorded tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.178" offset="7464103">I emphasize that although the tax lien arose prior to bankruptcy by virtue of a demand the notice of the lien was not recorded until subsequent to the bankrupt filing his involuntary petition or his voluntary petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.181" offset="7560129">The Government has contended that this lien is valid against the trustee in bankruptcy because he is not one of the classes of persons mentioned in Section 6323 which in part reads that the lien imposed by Section 6321 shall not be valid against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser or judgment creditor until notice thereof has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.328" offset="7668694">The trustee contends that Section 70c of the Bankruptcy Act in effect makes him a judgment creditor or gives him all the rights, remedies and powers of a judgment creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.478" offset="7729298">Section 70c reads in part that the trustee as to all property, whether or not coming into possession or control of the court upon which a creditor of the bankrupt could have obtained the lien by legal or equitable proceedings at the date of bankruptcy shall be deemed divested as of such date and with all the rights, remedies and powers of a creditor then holding a lien thereon by such proceedings, whether or not a creditor actually exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.447" offset="7865135">The plain meaning of this section is that the trustee has the rights, remedies and powers of a judgment creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.424" offset="7905050">It could not be any more definitive in its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.130" offset="7915917">The statute does not say that he is a judgment creditor, but it says that he has the rights, powers and remedies of a creditor holding a lien which is in the effect what a judgment creditor is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.754" offset="7970356">Logically then, the trustee should prevail over an unrecorded tax lien because he has such rights, in fact he has all the rights, remedies and powers of a judgment creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.865" offset="8022810">If he does not so prevail then we must conclude that he does not have all the rights, remedies and powers given to him by Section 70c.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.340" offset="8064711">Now this Court has never precisely ruled on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.233" offset="8084355">It did skirt it in United States versus Gilbert Associates in 345 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.831" offset="8114657">In that case this Court held that the language of the Internal Revenue Section 6323 meant judgment creditor only in the usual conventional sense of those terms, but we submit that this instant case is distinguishable from the Gilbert case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.782" offset="8186546">The Gilbert case was not deciding a bankruptcy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.954" offset="8203160">It was not concerned with whether the trustee was a judgment creditor within the purview of Section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.473" offset="8241298">It was deciding priorities between the lien of a city in New Hampshire whose tax was found by the state court in New Hampshire to be in the nature of a judgment and the Federal Government's unrecorded, but antecedent tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.661" offset="8321964">Further, the Gilbert decision was predicated by a desire to procure uniformity of tax law among the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.409" offset="8356968">At page 364 the Court said, the cardinal principle of Congress in its tax scheme is uniformity in as far as maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.456" offset="8401168">In this case, the Simonson case, there could be no danger of such non-uniformity because it involves the construction of federal law by federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.127" offset="8447875">In the Gilbert case, there could possibly be construction of law by state courts which would interfere with the federal tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.003" offset="8483401">Now all lower federal courts that have decided this precise question have ruled adversely to the trustee -- oh, there's one exception to that in I believe the Second Circuit but they later after the decision in the Gilbert case took a contrary position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.429" offset="8565112">However in the Simonson case Judge Hamley while concurring with the rest of the court expressed that he would have ruled otherwise had it been the case of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.687" offset="8622164">In the In re Fidelity Tube Corporation decided by the Third Circuit in 1960, Judge Kalodner joined by Judge Hastie wrote a very exhaustive dissenting opinion in which he cited various cases concerning the interpretation of 70c.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.458" offset="8717249">Now, when Congress passed Section 70c it made it abundantly clear what it intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.237" offset="8752358">The report of the Senate Judiciary Committee which considered and eventually -- which considered the amendment to Bankruptcy Act is quoted in our brief at page 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.150" offset="8807946">Briefly the intention was to protect general creditors of the bankrupt from secret liens, and to give all creditors rights they might have acquired under state law have there been no bankruptcy and rights from which they are debarred by bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.657" offset="8877955">Once a petition in bankruptcy is filed the creditors may not seek to become judgment creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.204" offset="8900211">They can only pursue their rights if the Bankruptcy Law gives them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.491" offset="8941380">To rule that the Government's lien is inferior to the rights of the trustee would in no way hurt the Government because if they wish to be secured, then you'd only file their lien duly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.110" offset="8999790">The revenue sources could be protected in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.099" offset="9019747">Now in its brief the Government has made reference to Section 67b of the Bankruptcy Act which in effect would allow perfection of a lien subsequent to bankruptcy where it arose prior to bankruptcy but was not perfected prior to bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.717" offset="9094248">Now this statue and I quote in part reads, “Whereby such laws, such liens are required to be perfected and arise but are not perfected before bankruptcy they may nevertheless be valid if perfected within the time permitted by and in accordance with the requirements of such laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.405" offset="9180975">Now, first it is to be noted that the language here is permissive not mandatory since they may be nevertheless valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.073" offset="9219636">Now this has been interpreted by authorities such as Collier on Bankruptcy to mean that where the applicable lien law would hold the statutory lien inferior to the rights of a creditor with a judicial lien which we contend are rights, powers, and remedies given to the trustee by 70c, then the judicial lien or the trustee shall prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.025" offset="9331440">In other words the trustee may invoke Section 70c to (Inaudible) a lien unperfected under the law if such lien is not valid against any other judgment creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.468" offset="9381282">Now the importance of the defeating of the lien is this that if there is no lien then Section 57j of the Bankruptcy Act which specifically prohibits payment of penalties to the United States comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.780" offset="9446484">The Government has not contented that if it has a non-lien tax claim that it is entitled to penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.015" offset="9479398">Their contention is only that if the claim is lien that they are entitled to collect penalty from the bankrupt estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2376.864" offset="9610846">Mr. Chief Justice, if it pleases the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.592" offset="9633729">The Government is in perfect agreement with the petitioners that Section 57j does operate to disallow unsecured claims of the United States or of any state for penalties. Wherein we disagree, of course, is in the petitioner's contention that 57j also operates to disallow secured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.998" offset="9735398">It is our contention that 57j has no such effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.972" offset="9759222">Now, before going into the detailed reasons for support of the judgments below, I should just like to make one point with respect to petitioner's argument on the equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.558" offset="9821602">We don't dispute petitioner's contention that a secured claim for tax penalties may create some harmful effect on unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.467" offset="9869249">Indeed Congress itself has indicated time and time again that it is concerned with the possible deleterious effect of allowing liens to come before unsecured creditors and therefore leaving the unsecured creditors without sufficient funds in the bankruptcy of estate to pay out their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.196" offset="9968201">But while it has recognized these injustices, it has made specific provision, and indeed it has amended the statute time and again, in order to deal with or in order to subordinate specific liens or invalidate specific liens, nullifying or void specific liens, but in none of these instances that has Congress seem fit to nullify or invalidate a federal or state tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.874" offset="10098918">In fact quite the contrary, Congress in 67b has stated that state and federal tax liens shall be or may be invalidated as against the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.503" offset="10153357">In the ‘may' is with respect to the particular laws which create these liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.189" offset="10184077">In other words, if these liens are not perfected in accordance with these laws then of course the trustee prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.332" offset="10212707">If they are, so says Congress or at least the way we interpret 67b then the lien shall prevail as against the trustee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.190" offset="11452165">That's precisely so and if you will allow me I shall try to explain why we come to this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.415" offset="11489050">Before doing so or as the preliminary in this argument, let me give you an example, an example that this Court itself said of and in fact decided in the case of Security Mortgage Company versus Powers which is at 278 U.S. and which we cite at footnote -- or in one of the footnotes in our brief at page 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.645" offset="11602004">The question there was dealt with a lien for a contingent claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.659" offset="11630007">Now there is no question that a contingent claim in bankruptcy is unprovable under Section 63d and because it is unprovable the Act states that under Section 57d, mind you another subsection of our General Section 57, under Section 57d, an unsecured claim for unsecured contingent claim shall not be allowed.N</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.312" offset="11756648">ow, the problem in this Security Mortgage Company case was that there was an un -- there was a claim, a contingent claim, but it was secured by a lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.917" offset="11811088">In this Court found no problem with the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.682" offset="11826134">They said, “There is such a distinction of status between secured and unsecured claims that while an unsecured contingent claim will be disallowable under Section 57d, a secured claim, a claim, a contingent claim secured by a lien is perfectly valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.172" offset="11900008">It is perfectly collectible in bankruptcy and we say that applying this analogy to 257j which is again within the same structure, while an unsecured claim for penalties is quite disallowable under bankruptcy, a lien for those secured penalties must be considered valid and must be considered therefore collectible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.733" offset="12018291">And to carry our argument one step further and I think that this will really highlight the -- what we really are talking about, when we're discussing disallowance of claims as opposed to invalidity of liens, we do not disagree with petitioner that this Court or I should say a bankruptcy court has complete powers as a court of equity to look behind the lien, to inquire into the validity of the lien itself as well as the validity of the debt underlying the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.518" offset="12165413">They have full powers to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.954" offset="12175235">The peculiarity of this case is that petitioners do not question the validity, the validity of our lien, nor do they question the validity of our debt nor can they, because after all the debt is validated by the statute which creates the tax lean statute which is referred into 67b, a debt for penalties specifically validated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.955" offset="12279202">What petitioners says is that a valid lien for a valid debt must be disallowed if the debt underlying debts -- underlying debt is for penalties, but we submit that Pepper v. Litton cannot be used as a basis for doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.343" offset="12380766">It doesn't stand for this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.417" offset="12392991">What in effect the petitioners want to do is strip away the lien itself and then disallow the un -- the claim underlying as an unsecured claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3678.338" offset="14816737">The reason why we have this distinction between disallowance of unsecured claims, its invalidation of liens is because a lien is a charge on the property which comes in to bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.106" offset="14875773">For example, if a valid and preexisting lien exists -- if property which has a valid and preexisting lien passes to the trustee its virtually black letter law that it passes as they say (Inaudible) passes subject to the lien and this is why Section 67b of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 which was incidentally the predecessor of 67b.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.825" offset="14982666">This is why 67b stated that a valid lien shall not be affected by bankruptcy and indeed this is why the Ninth Circuit in the Knox-Powell case specifically stated that since an adjudication in bankruptcy does not affect the valid lien Section 57j cannot be operative to disallow -- disallow a lien for penalties and indeed this Court Goggin and I might point out which we stated did involve a lien for penalties although that was not an issue, this Court in Goggin did cite the Knox-Powell case with authority and did say that the Chandler Act amendments did nothing to harm, destroy or changed the congressional purpose of maintaining the vitality of claims which are secured by liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.901" offset="15210977">Perhaps, I can highlight this in a slightly different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.832" offset="15230725">We have to approach it from different directions to try to perhaps overcome as I see it a very perfectly normal idea in your mind that when Congress does say liens are -- penalties are invalid, they're invalid, but let me highlight it from this point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.040" offset="15303555">Let us contrast the secured creditor on the one hand and the unsecured creditor on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.876" offset="15326856">The procedures to which they must go before they may realize on their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.370" offset="15352874">Now it's clear that if an unsecured creditor wishes to even get a pro rata share of his claim, he must come into bankruptcy and file and prove his claim under Section 57.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.530" offset="15417448">This is just a pro forma thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.406" offset="15424972">This is what he must do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.792" offset="15434585">On the other hand, a secured creditor has a variety of choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.262" offset="15460394">For example, if the secured creditor has the property, solely and properly in his possession, he can ignore the bankruptcy proceeding entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.857" offset="15498846">He can decline to file his claim and rely solely on his security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.709" offset="15518177">Thus for example, if the Government had possession of this property prior bankruptcy and indeed this was an example which this Court discussed in the Goggin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.543" offset="15557569">If it have possession, it could have refused to enter bankruptcy and realized on its claim and no Section of the Bankruptcy Act including Section 57j could have harmed, could have influ -- could have affected the Government's claim whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.102" offset="15639803">The Government may have -- could have sold the property and realized out of that -- the proceeds of that sale, its claim, and its secured claim for penalties as well as taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="5415.146" offset="21763950">Now, Collier in his analysis of this does discuss the Section and he says, “Well, it doesn't necessarily mean as against the trustee,” but then goes to say, “Well, grammatically speaking, it is elliptical and I suppose you could read it that way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.578" offset="21829674">The Government contends that this does mean as against the trustee.</text>

            <text syncTime="5440.663" offset="21866036">So, that the lien therefore arises at assessment and is perfected upon demand for payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5448.884" offset="21898951">Thereafter notice of the lien maybe filed and once perfected that lien relates back to the time of assessment.</text>

            <text syncTime="5464.410" offset="21961017">The lean arose at assessment about a full month a half before bankruptcy and the demand was made indeed 10 days thereafter, so the notice and demand were made prior to bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.896" offset="22026951">Then the notice, the filing of the notice of our lien was made after bankruptcy but this is entirely within the scope of the lien provision because then our argument goes -- the lien was perfected in accordance with the statute which created it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5504.983" offset="22123290">It related back as of the time of assessment which was a month and a half prior to bankruptcy and therefore it has to be considered as against the trustee whose rights only arise at the time the petition for bankruptcy is filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5574.128" offset="22399875">It's been held and you'll notice in our brief, we cite the (Inaudible) case and indeed in the In re Fidelity Tube case which was a Third Circuit case, there's a discussion of this and it again, virtually black letter law that when a lien is perfected it relates back as of the time of the assessment so that -- as against the rights of the trustee, we maintain that under 67b itself we should take precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.706" offset="22522232">Any other holding would create a very peculiar situation, because what it would do would be to grant a state tax lien which may in fact be junior to the Government's federal tax lien, but nevertheless give it priority over the Government, not only over the Government's lien, but knock out the Government's lien and allow all the state tax liens to be realized on first prior to the trustees' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.411" offset="22632991">If the statutes which create the state tax liens allow perfection prior -- subsequent to bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5640.741" offset="22666324">Clearly it would seem that Congress did not have this intention in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.519" offset="22681475">It didn't have the intention of allowing the state tax lien to come over the federal tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.249" offset="22704358">Now our second argument deals with the particular -- the contention of the petitioner that under Section 6 -- under Section 70c, the judgment creditor is given the rights of a -- the trustees are given the rights of a judgment creditor for purposes of the tax lien statute, and since notice is filed subsequent to bankruptcy, he should take priority because the tax lien statute says that, our tax lien is not valid as against a purchaser, mortgagee, pledgee or judgment creditor if notice has not been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.777" offset="22842493">We believe that this Court's opinion in Gilbert Associates really the complete answer to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5692.088" offset="22871751">In other words, there it said that a judgment creditor must be one in the usual conventional sense namely having a judgment of a Court of record before it may realize this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.378" offset="22912920">And every Court of Appeals which has followed Gilbert Associates -- which has considered Gilbert Associates in relationship to the bankruptcy have said that although Section 70c gives the judgment, gives the trustee the rights of hypothetical judicial lien creditor, he's not a judgment creditor for purposes of this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="5753.326" offset="23116675">And we also agree that when it comes to the concepts of uniformity between the Bankruptcy Act and the tax lien statute, there is no virtually no problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="6166.645" offset="24769912">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6170.461" offset="24785168">I'm not surprised if there is confusion in the bankruptcy laws and the law of no regulation apparently and there are many reasons for this and I -- in all the sincerity and the seriousness would say that there -- two of the reasons for these areas of doubt, not only referred to us of penalty but other areas the bankruptcy law as well relate to this fact that over a long period of years in the courts of this land including the Supreme Court, the position of the Government with respect to taxes insofar as they relate to bankruptcy has been generally within this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.762" offset="24922467">They started out basically in insisting that regardless of the absence of specific language in the Bankruptcy Act at some point or not that the general language of the Internal Revenue Codes superseded are superior to the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6220.428" offset="24985057">And secondly, throughout their efforts to collect is a practical matter in the Bankruptcy Actions over the years, the one thread that runs through there more than anything else is that the Government as in other tax cases has been very considerably influenced by which position will bring it most revenue and I fully recognize does this Court a necessity is the revenue necessities to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6243.753" offset="25078366">But this is the reason in part, one of the reasons why it has been difficult to resolve that in early stage, some of these problems of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6253.271" offset="25116505">And I again remind the Court that in 1939 on the Knox-Powell-Stockton case came before the Ninth Circuit, the First Circuit court opinion on this matter of penalty that although these provisions, 57J had been in the bankruptcy statute since 1898, some 41 years the initial position of the Government in that case was to say the State of California cannot recover a tax penalty because it's precluded from doing so under 57J.</text>
            <text syncTime="6276.947" offset="25211173">And the next two cases that came up as I indicated were actually state court cases where the Government admittedly did -- take the other position this Court's following Knox-Powell-Stockton.</text>
            <text syncTime="6287.113" offset="25251819">Now I cited to the Court the Gardner case, but I did not read the language from it and I want to come back to that because I think it may answer some of the questions that this Court has had.</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.282" offset="25296541">Reading and its cited in our brief on page 14, reading from page 580 of the Gardner case and the decision by Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.123" offset="25327888">This was a case incidentally where New Jersey was asserting under its statutes a generalized tax lien against all the properties of the bankrupt railroad including not only principle of taxes and interest, but penalties as well in very substantial amounts and granted it is dicta and nevertheless here's what the Court said and I am quoting, “The reorganization court may also adjudicate questions pertaining to the amount of a tax claim secured by a lien.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6332.776" offset="25434467">We're not crossing the forbidden line marked by Arkansas Corporation Commission versus Thompson, 313 US 132.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.980" offset="25463306">There is for example the question whether the amount of the claim is topping now by the security tax claim, whether the amount of the claim has been swollen by the inclusion of a forbidden penalty and thus to that extent does not meet the bankruptcy requirements for proof and allowance of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="6356.807" offset="25530598">Section 57J of the Bankruptcy Act provides that debts owing estate as a penalty or forfeiture shall not be allowed and then the Court in its footnote cites Section 57J of the Bankruptcy Act as is it today in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="6370.420" offset="25585037">Now granted that's dicta, nevertheless it comes precisely to the point that is before the Court here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="6377.245" offset="25612309">And it applies not only in the reorganization proceedings where if anything the powers of the Court are broader or in addition to what they are in the bankruptcy, but it comes right down to an ordinary bankruptcy proceedings as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="6389.369" offset="25660897">The machinery of the Bankruptcy Act and this was urged to the Court of the Gardner case is the machinery for the handling of secured as well as unsecured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="6397.093" offset="25691721">Despite the language that the Government has used in this argument, in a secured claim the Government does come in, it files the claim, it asks for an order which whether you use the word allowance or denying or granting it's claim in part, the Court goes behind that claim to determine whether the amount of the tax claim is correct with reference to its principal, with reference to its interest and we say under 57J and along with other things love to see whether any part of the lien, the tax lien is for penalties and if so, disregard that part of it, but give full respect and accord to the lien of the taxes for the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6431.985" offset="25831320">Now, I submit that the language in the Gardner case is directly in point with the problem that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6437.615" offset="25853785">That it applies not only in the reorganization, but it applies in the ordinary bankruptcy as well and if the Goggin case which followed it -- follows it, it seems to me is explainable as I indicated as on a very narrow point that there they were concerned with the priorities under Section 64 of the Act where expenses of administration and secondary wage claimants, Congress has given a priority even over tax lien to some extent, but said that with respect to tax liens on personal property that they shall not take precedence over labor of claims under 64, unless accompanied by possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="6471.218" offset="25988263">In the Goggin case, the Government had possessions of the personal property and under a valid tax lien prior to the bankruptcy, so really that decision does no more than to say yes under those circumstances, there rights must be treated as the date of bankruptcy, they had a possession, they had a lien on the personal property, therefore, they are not subordinated to the claims of labor under Section 64.</text>
            <text syncTime="6491.293" offset="26068511">The Goggin case in effect does in our opinion, no more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6495.450" offset="26085125">Now, the Government in its brief and its argument has made the fair amount out of this matter of reading of Section 57J in its context.</text>
            <text syncTime="6504.690" offset="26122115">The suggestion is because the general context of just that area of the Bankruptcy Act has to do with proof and allowability of claims and they argue, this means only unsecured claims that therefore it can have no effect in -- with reference to Section 67.</text>
            <text syncTime="6521.820" offset="26190660">Now that argument is good for the Government in that respect seems to me we are open to raise the same argument with respect to Section 67 as I tried to indicate before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6530.921" offset="26227022">When you get the 67b, the thing which the section starts out with that it is primary concerned with is, "The provisions of Section 60 of this Act to the contrary notwithstanding statutory liens" and it goes on in various ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.285" offset="26284492">This is the context of this provision of 67b, if the Court please, following the attack of the Government in analyzing 57J, it is to try and protect the tax, secured tax claimant and other lien claimants against certain hazards which it would be exposed to under Section 60 which deals -- Section 60 dealing with preferences and fraudulent transfers and various things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="6571.334" offset="26388668">Now, it seems to me that if that is to be the test of how you analyze these two sections of the statute, well then we're just as entitled as the Government if not more so to that benefit, but I would say that it is more important for this Court in analyzing both Section 67 and 57J to look to the general purpose and tenor of the Bankruptcy Act in what it's seeking to accomplish and certainly if you look to the purpose and tenor of the Bankruptcy Act and the decisions under it, then I suggest indeed that this Court in interpreting any one single section of a very complex related act to that kind should come out with the result which a result petitioners urge here which gives effect to both sections and is consistent with the general purposes of the Act and consistent with the thought that penalties are peculiarly something which should not be recovered in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6625.927" offset="26607052">Now, the Government has also made considerable contention about this matter of possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="6631.813" offset="26630666">Of course it's not an unusual thing in the law for the Courts to find that someone in possession property may find the rights are little greater or little easier to defend and when he doesn't have possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="6642.191" offset="26672149">I will say this that after all possession even as to non-secured creditor with the Bankruptcy Act is an important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6648.385" offset="26696913">An insolvent can pay even a general creditor and accept to the extent that it may be a preference within a four-month period under the statute or fraudulent transfer or something and he will be entitled to keep his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.070" offset="26739649">And in the same way a secured creditor whether it's a secured creditor with the lien for taxes or otherwise if he gets payment, whether it's by attaching and getting property, whether its money or whatever it is of course, the fact that possession has certain consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="6674.672" offset="26802030">And if the property in case for example is not worth any more than the principal of these taxes, you wouldn't even get to the issue of penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6681.591" offset="26829720">I'm not prepared to answer completely what the effect would be under all circumstances and the Court raised this question as to whether if a person had possession of property that this would preclude a reorganization trustee or an ordinary bankruptcy trustee from bringing the government or any other lien claimant into court to determine the extent or circumstances if any under which it might be necessary for -- to reclaim possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="6708.002" offset="26935359">Of course, in many cases the amount of the tax might be such that it exceeds the value of the property that the issue wouldn't be before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6714.659" offset="26962004">But in connection with reorganizations which are basically governed by the same law here as your ordinary bankruptcy and ours is a corporate reorganization of the utility, I want to remind the Court that if the various state and the local authorities, the taxing authorities pursuant to liens which might include penalties or the Federal Government itself proceed to take possession of property, in particular, if there's a real debate as to the value of their property being in access of the amount of the taxes, obviously, there could be a frustration of the purposes of the reorganization statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6748.932" offset="27099094">And I myself think that there may be a question as to whether or not a reorganization trustee, for example, or bankruptcy trustee might bring them before the Court and under certain circumstances, the property might be turned in.</text>
            <text syncTime="6760.783" offset="27146533">Of course, frequently the Government as they've indicated voluntarily to a property and other lien claimants too because there're advantages to them, they can -- it can be sold more readily in the machinery of the bankruptcy court taking clear of liens and they may realize more for their money.</text>
            <text syncTime="6773.188" offset="27196165">So frequently, the problem resolves itself at a practical level.</text>
            <text syncTime="6778.677" offset="27218108">Now, the Court asked a question with regard to the -- whether or not this taxes generally and the penalties are dischargeable in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6789.398" offset="27260949">Now we have raised this question in our brief, and I'd like to comment a little further on it also.</text>
            <text syncTime="6794.997" offset="27283310">Now, keep in mind that the penalty is the penalty against the taxpayer, because he doesn't filed his return on time or paid his tax on time or something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="6802.445" offset="27313194">The Government whether its state or federal has not lost anything in the normal sense if they get their tax plus interest to the date of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6810.370" offset="27344854">And the person who has defaulted is the taxpayer, but if you allow the penalty to be collected as part of a lien in bankruptcy, why then of course you're penalizing the labor claimants and the cost of administration under some circumstances and in most cases, the general creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6826.619" offset="27409847">Now, actually the Government does try to collect the penalty tax under Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6834.031" offset="27439522">The language just says that taxes are not dischargeable in bankruptcy without defining what is included in taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6840.844" offset="27466794">So there's no question for that as to the principal of taxes that the Government can and does try to collect from the bankrupt even after his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6848.426" offset="27497096">Now in the U.S. versus Michelle, a Tenth -- the Tenth Circuit case, 273 F.2d 682 which is cited in our brief and which is the second decision of the Tenth Circuit in which they decided on this penalty issue, this was actually an effort on the part of the Government to collect that tax penalty after bankruptcy, after discharge from the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.175" offset="27580061">Now this is the only case of that kind, but I suggest we can well assume that the Government will in other Circuits as far as possible, or at least until there's a decision by this Court will attempt to collect tax penalties from the bankrupt after a discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6887.028" offset="27651532">And we have no objection to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6889.434" offset="27661145">We say that that's where they should try to collect it rather than seeking to collect it in the bankruptcy proceeding where it necessarily penalizes the other creditors and corrupts in many ways the administration of the Bankruptcy Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6902.941" offset="27715166">Take for example in the reorganization such as the reorganization in the Harris case of a small telephone company and keep in mind as the record shows that before bankruptcy, the Government had an offer and compromise and was apparently giving consideration to accepting 57,000 of principle of the taxes and (Inaudible) end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6919.518" offset="27781413">What happens in the reorganization is exactly this?</text>
            <text syncTime="6922.609" offset="27793847">If the reorganization is successful to the extent it's successful and the Government begins to see that the chances are so good and after all they should ride along, and they should collect not only the principal of their taxes, but the interest to the date of bankruptcy and the penalties that they're supported by a lien and they're also as they did in this case, seeking to recover post petition interest as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="6943.603" offset="27877752">This was denied under a recent Ninth Circuit decision and the Harrington case also denied it to them in another Circuit so there are now two Circuit Court decisions saying they can't get post petition interest in a reorganization or bankruptcy even though its supported by a lien, but that issue has not been before this Court for settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="6959.825" offset="27942640">And this is merely illustration again of my point that the one consistent thread through all this is that indeed bankruptcy cases at the practical level, in the District Court and Circuit Court, the government's basic position; first with reference to the interest on non lien tax claims which they finally lost in the Safer case, then with respect to penalties, next with respect to post petition interest on lien claims and so it go, the one thread running through all of it is that the Government consistently tries to take the position which will net it the most revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6991.730" offset="28070327">And this unfortunately has not easy before the trustees or the bankruptcy courts to resolve these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6999.229" offset="28100315">Now, let me close by only one other comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7004.918" offset="28123094">I think that in addition as I mentioned to the fact that the language of the statute we think can be read to disallow these penalties or deny them, whatever phrase you want to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="7016.893" offset="28170951">It doesn't make much difference and that this is the real -- the only really sensible construction in our opinion of these sections of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="7025.446" offset="28205119">In addition to that, if the Court feels that the languages 57J is -- leaves something to be desired and I don't pretend that it's as clear as it might be, I think the Court still can rely upon the general purpose of the bankruptcy and the fact that where there is a conflict between it and a revenue act that it ought to prevail and take cognizance of this matter and the equity power of the court with respect to penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="7048.595" offset="28297801">And this for example is cited by Professor Moore in his bankruptcy treaties and which he says in effect that disallowance theory needs talking about the disallowance of penalties can also be supported without resort to either section of the Act exclusively but rather upon established equitable principles applicable to individual's rights which prohibit enforcement of penalty or forfeiture clauses in context, (Inaudible) 6307.</text>
            <text syncTime="7078.329" offset="28416711">In other words, if there is in the court's mind any thought that the language of 57J is perhaps a little inept, nevertheless, the court use that as an additional reason to sustain our contention that the penalty should not be recovered or payable in the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7094.053" offset="28479613">Thank you.</text>
