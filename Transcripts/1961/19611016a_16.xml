            <text syncTime="32.875" offset="234872">The question involved here is whether or not the warranty of seaworthiness is owed by a vessel which has been put into navigation for a commercial purpose, and well the warranty extends to gear an equipment which is attached to the dock on one end but is laying in the hole and is performing maritime services in the service to the vessel during the unloading operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.585" offset="369664">I stated the piece of equipment involved in this case is a grain shovels on a marine leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.126" offset="399862">It leans over from the dock into the hole of the vessel and is the only method in which this vessel can be unloaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.320" offset="440613">This Court said recently in 1959, West versus the United States, that the emphasis now, the focus should be upon the status of the vessel in order to determine the -- whether or not it was in navigation and the warranty was old.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.981" offset="515323">We believe that the decision also imply that the warranty extends also to gear and equipment which is used in the maritime service of the vessel which I say practical and reasonable relation to the maritime service.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.903" offset="1283009">Now, if we will have no job analysis to determine whether the maritime worker is entitled to the warranty of seaworthiness, why should we have in a gear or equipment analysis?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leavenworth Colby</label>
            <text syncTime="364.124" offset="1559907">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.509" offset="1577357">It seems to me my brother and his distinguished argument has pointed out precisely what the difficulty is and how this case came to be decided and how it's here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.766" offset="1650395">He has said that the Court in West said that no job analysis would serve to determine the scope of the warranty of seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.142" offset="1715911">Now, that we think means in effect that the scope of the warranty of seaworthiness must be determined upon the particular facts and circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.937" offset="1791143">And in this case, two courts below have held that in the special facts in the circumstances of the case, the man here did not suffer damage as a result of the reasonable reliance upon a warranty or representation by the shipowner that the equipment which injured him was safe or seaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.075" offset="1935653">One judge in the Court of Appeals below dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.099" offset="1959790">He appeared to be of the view that my learned brother has so skillfully advocated here, that whenever any kind of a device is used to assist in the maritime operation, whatever the maritime operation, that device should be deemed to be warranted, to be seaworthy for a voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.539" offset="2089566">Now of course, there are certain semantically difficulties about using words in this way, but I pass those.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.782" offset="2130526">I should like to remind the Court of the origin and development and analysis of what it is, a breach of warranty of seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.703" offset="2194160">As Mr. Justice Stewart so skillfully set forth and Mr. Justice Frankfurter also in his dissent in the Mitchell case, the concept to the warranty of seaworthiness was originally developed in respect of the shipowner's warranty to the underwriter and the shipowner's warranty to the shipper and the shipowner's warranty the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.093" offset="2307741">All of whom were people who knew nothing about what was going on aboard with the exception of the passenger they weren't even there.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.680" offset="2346088">Now, beginning with the case of (Inaudible) the famous coal oil can case where they had gasoline in the coal oil can.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.023" offset="2387466">This conception was extended to cover a situation where without fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.150" offset="2431979">The shipowner had misled the seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.510" offset="2453400">So now, we find that this conception of recovery for the breach of warranty of seaworthiness is precisely the same sort of thing as the courts were confronted with in connection with the warranty of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.880" offset="2518915">And accordingly, we found that when we got to sea rocky, the Court very properly extended the rule as the courts had ruled with respect to the sale of shore side property in MacPherson against Buick to everyone who was within the reach of the representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.665" offset="2610030">And the Court most properly said, “We will not draw the line as to whether the man is a seaman in the strict sense, but we will extend it wherever the man is aboard the ship doing maritime work or as they keep saying work of the same nature as the seaman.”</text>
            <text syncTime="648.210" offset="2696234">Now, that of course as this Court has developed through the years, then requires the same factors that it does in a breach of warranty of sale onshore.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.337" offset="2768750">There must be a representation that something is fit for a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.617" offset="2797798">There must be a reasonable reliance upon that representation and there must be an injury causally resulting from the reasonable reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.726" offset="2862268">And this Court through a series of decisions has developed and expanded this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.754" offset="2898422">Most significant it seems to me in the context we have today, is as both courts below thought, this Court's decision in the West case where the court held that if the shipowner did not represent that the vessel was seaworthy but on the contrary represented that it was unseaworthy, the man could not rely upon any inconsistent implication of a warranty of seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.479" offset="3049305">Now, two courts below appreciating the facts have come to the conclusion that this is the same sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.487" offset="3097370">Now, my brother's argument it seems to me, pre-supposes a representation that the courts below decided against his client solely because they thought this vessel was not in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.737" offset="3182320">And secondarily, that this matter was one resulting from a part of the real estate onshore which extended over into the hole when it's sucked up the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.898" offset="3242924">Now, I don't think that that isn't anyways consistent with what the court below actually said, because if Your Honors will examine pages 102, 103 and so forth of the record, you will see that that is not at all what the Court of Appeals thought about the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.011" offset="3327457">The Court of Appeals said that with respect to a special factual situation like this, there was no representation by the shipowner that the unloading equipment of the vessel was seaworthy and properly maintained because it all has been taken off.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.172" offset="3420035">It says that, at the bottom of page 102, “No such limited use could give rise to a warranty of seaworthiness of unloading equipment, all of which was still in mothballs” and that refers to the fact that the blooms were still aboard but they were lashed down or completely removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.230" offset="3496312">Now, my brother very properly says that here, he wouldn't have unloaded it with the ship's equipment in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.286" offset="3528495">Now, it seems to me that far from giving rise to an implication in the circumstances, that the shipowner warranted the seaworthiness for a voyage of the equipment which was passed to the dock, which could not go on a voyage and which could not for all practical purposes ever be inspected, controlled, examined, repaired, or what have you by the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.520" offset="3661406">This is not within the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.205" offset="3672168">Now, I would like to direct the Court's attention to this picture that you'll have of the marine leg and see where it is up there before its -- when it's retracted before it's introduced into the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.068" offset="3727653">And you will see that so far as the ship's people are concerned, all it can do is look up and see it as a part of the real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.629" offset="3765896">It's attached to this tower which is attached to the grain elevator and it swings out and comes down.</text>

            <text syncTime="2369.539" offset="9581484">I think what they decided was, that in this circumstances, the shipowner had not made any representation upon which the plaintiff relied and which the shipowner had breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.558" offset="9661628">Now, I think that's the essential holding of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.862" offset="9674794">Now, the opinion keeps discussing this in terms that there was no warranty of unloading equipment because of the special circumstances of the case that the unloading equipment had been taken out and off of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.253" offset="9748355">And you and Chief Justice very properly called attention to the fact that actually in the circumstances of this case, i.e. the removal of grain out of the railroad car, out of the barge, out of a vessel, out of anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.163" offset="11296057">However, much it may represent a chance to throw away an opportunity to instruct the District Courts in the bar as to what the applicable law would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.397" offset="11344959">I have no occasion to teach that with your experience in the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.705" offset="11370141">I have no occasion to teach that much trouble would be avoided if judges in Courts of Appeal would recognize that in addition to deciding the particular case, they are also engaged in providing guidance to District Courts and lawyers who have other cases coming along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.779" offset="11462510">Now, I must agree with you that the court below didn't take the opportunity to recognize that this problem is presented in this case on a ship where there was no loading equipment of board but could have been presented equally on a case where there was loading equipment of board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.346" offset="11548714">But I remind you again Mr. Justice, that there is an old judicial concept and approach that you always decide everything on the narrowest possible grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.441" offset="11597093">Now again and again and again, this has been proven to be an awkward way of deciding cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.671" offset="11626036">I'm sure that Mr. Justice Frankfurter can provide some delightful examples because as I recall when I went to school to him nearly 30 year ago, he then had something of the sort which he tried it out as examples of how judges by trying to be too narrow had not done themselves to the bar any good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.325" offset="11724675">So it seems to me what we have is the case where this Court may very well want to deal with the other aspect, but that doesn't mean that there's any necessity just because the Court of Appeals may have do it in felicitously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.758" offset="11782353">The Court of Appeals should be reversed, because I think quite to contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.317" offset="11796668">There's everything in the record and in the Court of Appeals' opinion, there is implicit what Your Honor has raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.988" offset="12275336">Now, the other question involved regarding the equipment, we don't believe as we stated before that it makes any particle of difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.269" offset="12336462">Well, it would go to see.For instance, no one ever supposed that the -- an atomic reactor would go to sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.338" offset="12376691">But in the Savannah today, a merchant vessel who has been at sea over a year, wholly and totally powered by atomic power, whoever supposed that that would go to sea.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="3082.671" offset="12434056">Do you consider there any -- under the disputed issues of fact shown by this record?</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney H. Kelsey</label>
            <text syncTime="3088.854" offset="12458820">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.447" offset="12461119">I do not sir because the facts are clearly with a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.668" offset="12486092">The vessel was in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.536" offset="12493511">She made aboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.936" offset="12499153">She was unloading her cargo and the only way it could be unloaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.204" offset="12520155">Now, if you're going to strip this longshoreman of his benefit of the warranty when he's using equipment, the only equipment that the shipowner has, however, provided him well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.943" offset="12579192">The only equipment to do his job, if you're going to strip him of a warranty on the basis, on the analysis, that one end of the equipment is on the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.537" offset="12633527">We think it's not in accordance with the prior decisions of this Court that the equipment covered is given equipment which I think practical and reasonable relationship to the maritime service of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.414" offset="12704998">Everything were arises out of a maritime service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.361" offset="12720776">All around that vessel and floating in water, well its type to the dock (Inaudible) is the maritime protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.083" offset="12759751">And Congress as I mentioned earlier, extended it to the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.658" offset="12778036">Now, as to the other part of the case which my friend allude to that we could have sued someone else, we -- we didn't sue anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.674" offset="12858075">In fact, we couldn't because equipment actually was not owned by Continental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.206" offset="12876152">It was owned by Northwest Railroad, which was an independent contractor and it leased equipment to Continental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.306" offset="12904573">But the point in case is that the United States, the largest shipowner in the world, provided this defective equipment for this longshoreman to you, and it was docked at the face and the whole of the ship using in it, as Chief Judge Sobeloff have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.634" offset="12993912">We believe the Supreme Court under these facts would grant a recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.503" offset="13013347">Thank you sir.</text>
