            <text syncTime="196.384" offset="890922">When the Court adjourned yesterday, I was reviewing the record in Number 26, the Garner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.273" offset="938465">And we had just reviewed the testimony of the store manager which amounted to the fact that the students had appeared at the store, had asked for coffee and that the police arrived, the manager hadn't call them, the police had not consulted with the manager, and the police arrested the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.208" offset="1010249">Captain Wiener, the police officer, who -- the police captain who made the arrests in each of these three cases, testified in this case as he did in the others, that he received a call at the police headquarters from the officer on the beat and I'm referring to page 34 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.503" offset="1075451">He told me that there were two Negroes sitting at the lunch counter at Sitman's Drugstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.260" offset="1094468">I told them to just standby until he arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.909" offset="1105021">They immediately went to the store within less than 10 minutes, spoke to the students, Major Bauer approached them and told them that they were violating the law by sitting there and asked them to leave and when they refused to leave, Major Bauer arrested them.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.393" offset="1170954">The police captain was asked why he arrested them, what law were they violating, and he said, “By the fact that they were sitting at a counter that was reserved for white people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="279.435" offset="1223199">And he was pressed on this point saying now, “Just what law was that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="282.851" offset="1236783">And he said, “The law said that this place was reserved for white people and only white people can sit there,” and that was the reason they were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.959" offset="1269279">Further pressed on the point, he said, “They have a law here.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.109" offset="1281818">I believe that covered such a situation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="296.431" offset="1291118">And then he was driven back to saying, that law at the bottom of page 35 of the record, “Is the “disturbing the peace” law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="303.025" offset="1317554">And when asked how were they disturbing the peace on page 36 of the record, he answered affirmatively to a question which was, “The mere presence of these Negro defendants sitting at this café counter seat reserved for white folks was violating the law, is that what you are saying?”</text>
            <text syncTime="320.650" offset="1387980">And so that is what constituted the violation of the law in Number 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.585" offset="1415774">On the basis of this record and this is the entire transcript of testimony that I've summarized and I believe accurately, the trial court made a finding of guilt and that was, it appears on page 37 of the record, it occupies about of half a page, these two accused who are in this place of business on the date alleged, they were seated at the counter, they were not served, the officers were called, they arrived, they informed the accused they would have to leave, and they refused to leave, whereupon the officers placed them under arrest under Section 103 (7).</text>
            <text syncTime="365.851" offset="1568852">And the court was convinced by this beyond a reasonable doubt that these two defendants on this occasion at that time and place performed an act done in a manner calculated to and actually did unreasonably disturbed and alarmed the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.085" offset="1645756">The basis on of this finding of guilt, the court sentenced the petitioners to 30 days imprisonment, a $100 fine, and upon default of the payment of $100, they would have to serve 90 days in jail which would run consecutively with the 30.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.116" offset="6029834">Number 28 is the “sit-in” case involving Kress' Dime Store in Baton Rouge, and in this case, the testimony is similar and as Mr. Justice Whittaker indicated, when the manager testified, “Were they requested to move over to the counter reserved for colored people?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.330" offset="6098693">He said, “No sir, they were advised that we would serve them over there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.060" offset="6117710">The manager in this case was so little disturbed by what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.761" offset="6132443">He was eating his meal at the counter when the students arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.534" offset="6147594">He finished his meal first, then he went to the telephone and he called the police, but he did not call the police to arrest them and he did not call the police because there was any disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.973" offset="6193361">He said he called them merely as a cautionary measure because, “I feared some disturbance might occur because it isn't customary for the two races to sit together and eat together.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.135" offset="6237978">However, there was no testimony that any disturbance did occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.295" offset="6254592">In fact as in the other cases, they were arrested as Captain Wiener testified again that -- here's the question, “Did these” -- on 37, “Did these defendants do anything other than sit at these particular Café counter seats that you would consider disturbing the peace who are in violation of any law?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.408" offset="6343095">Answer, “Well, other than the fact that one of them mentioned something about the iced water, nothing else was said” and then another question, “How are they disturbing the peace” and as in the other records, “By sitting there” “and that is because they were members of the Negro race?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.756" offset="6408401">Answer, “That was because that place was reserved for white people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.055" offset="6429612">And on 38 and 39, the Court makes a finding similar to the finding of the other cases, though the findings in each case are in slightly different language and careful reading indicates that different facts were found in each such as -- in Garner, it was found that they actually did disturbed the peace and no such thing occurred in -- Briscoe was found, they actually would alarm the public and in this one, it was found they foreseeably could alarm the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.145" offset="6558030">So there's some slight difference in language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2452.476" offset="9915288">Our first legal argument as I hope I brought out in response to questions was that it ought to be cleared that where the police officer acts initially because he observes the Negroes sitting at the counter reserved for white persons, but this arrest and conviction violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.490" offset="9987385">In the -- any number of cases, I think this Court has made clear the principles, the state may not enforce racial discrimination and certainly there can be no more effective state officer than the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.847" offset="10056767">And I think all of these records ought to be read and must be read as the police officer Captain Wiener coming to the lunch counter upon receiving calls from a variety of people saying these Negro students sitting at the lunch counter and arresting them for the mere presence of their being there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.295" offset="10138582">Number 27 Briscoe, there has been a suggestion, the Government's brief discusses it at some length, that perhaps, there might have been an initial request by somebody in the establishment that these petitioners leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.055" offset="10197619">We don't read the record that way and I read the record as Mr. Justice Whittaker indicated that they at best told that they could be served over at the other side if they wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.285" offset="10238579">Moreover in Briscoe, the finding of the Court rests on one independent ground that the police officer told them to leave and they did not and we submit that under decisions of this Court in Stromberg against California, the Williams case, and Terminiello that if one of the two grounds of a conviction is unconstitutional, then as part of a generalized finding, then the conviction must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.672" offset="10328127">So all three cases fall under the first argument that we have made, that where the police officer acts initially because he sees the Negroes sitting at the counter reserved for white persons, such a arrest and conviction violates the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.859" offset="10384865">If however, this Court were to read the record in the Briscoe case as indicating some demand to leave and we don't think it should, we submit that it should not make any difference constitutionally that the police officer's action was motivated by the fact that the manager at the lunch counter refused to serve and thereafter requested the police officer to make the arrest which after indictment is followed by conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.737" offset="10492385">In this situation, you have state action in the arrest of the defendant, trial of the defendant, the conviction, the sentencing of the defendant, all taken solely to enforce the private racial prejudice of a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.746" offset="10552362">This Court previously has held that such state action violates the Fourteenth Amendment as in the Girard College case where Stephen Girard set up a will and to enforce his private prejudice, got state officials, city officials of the City of Philadelphia to implement this prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.271" offset="10614533">This Court struck that down in a brief opinion and we feel that in the Shelley and the Barrows case, Barrows against Jackson and other cases, this Court has clearly indicated that if state action is enforcing private prejudice, that is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2695.698" offset="10888192">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors; the defendants here have attempted to color these cases entirely in terms of Negro versus white people, and to raise in that very limited context, the question of whether or not the police power of the City of Baton Rouge maybe invoked to enforce a private property owner's right to be secured in his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.858" offset="11000832">Therefore the issue actually before the Court is much broader as stated by the defendant and involves the basic fundamental issue of whether or not in our country, a private property owner still has the right to admit or deny access to his property or to restrict in some fashion the use of that property for any reason that he may choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.460" offset="11115248">Or does a man, by entering into a private business which may ultimately result in a gain to him or which may ultimately result in a total loss which he alone must bear become a public trust open to anyone whether objectionable to him or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.598" offset="11195810">We submit that he still possesses the right to chose who he would admit to his place of business and whom he will serve and as just as other citizens he has the right to call upon law enforcement officials to protect his rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="5914.134" offset="23761962">The next argument that is advanced and it is advanced primarily by the Government, at least it appeared to be, is that because Louisiana has adopted segregation laws in other fields or other areas in the past, and because the people of Louisiana had a custom of segregation, that this is state encouragement in the inception of this segregation and that the adoption of the segregation laws in other fields puts the State into the -- the discrimination to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.753" offset="23896440">In other words, they make the argument you go beyond the question of state enforcement of private discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.847" offset="23916816">They now say that because we have had segregation laws in other fields that makes us a part of the original discrimination which is therefore prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.803" offset="23960597">Of course as we noted in our brief, if you boil our argument down, it simply means that in a state which has segregation laws, the private businessmen can no longer refuse to admit whomever he might choose to his business or refuse to service to whomever, so he -- whomsoever he might chose while in a state, perhaps Montana or Nebraska or Colorado where -- which has had no segregation laws, the private businessmen in that State still has the right to choose whom he shall render his services to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5992.034" offset="24073550">We submit that -- that the argument on its face must be invalid on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.744" offset="24100404">The Government then raises the question of the Briscoe case, the Interstate Commerce Act relying on Boynton versus Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="6008.055" offset="24137603">With respect to that case, we would submit first that you have the same situation here that you had in Boynton versus Virginia to the extent that the restaurant is not owned by the interstate commerce carrier, it is owned by a separate corporation not under the control, and therefore, fits into the dissent by Justice Stewart, joined by Justice Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="6030.060" offset="24225688">In addition in the Boynton case, you had a passenger in Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6035.777" offset="24248571">Here, you do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6037.404" offset="24255049">Now, the Government argues that the Interstate Commerce Act by the use of the term any particular person includes people even who are not in Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.848" offset="24304786">We submit respectfully, Your Honors, that when you read the language of the statute in which all of the -- when which the discrimination is prohibited, where they say to subject any particular person, port, gateway, locality, region, district, territory or description of traffic that you must relate all of those first words to the term or description of traffic, because that is only the separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.293" offset="24414605">All of the other words are lumped together and only disjunctively separated by the term description of traffic which implies by description of traffic, they mean traffic in interstate commerce, and that the act was not intended to apply to persons or goods, not in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6094.258" offset="24482419">In fact, I think Congress intended that in the language that they chose from the fact that, of course, Congress gets its power to regulate interstate commerce through the Interstate Commerce Clause, that is to regulate commerce between and among the states and that would necessarily apply to the carrier in the interstate commerce and it would necessarily apply to the goods that he carries in interstate commerce, and of course, this Court has held and it also applies in areas where interstate commerce would be affected or it would be a burden upon interstate commerce which you do not have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6126.323" offset="24610732">In addition to that, we would also submit that nowhere in the Interstate Commerce Act or the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution that you find any authority for a person to go on to private property of anyone even in interstate commerce carrier and engage in a demonstration which that commerce carrier doesn't want him to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="6193.612" offset="24879898">We submit that in this particular statute, we have set down some specifics and then an additional clause to cover any other act committed in such a manner as would foreseeably disturb and alarm the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="6718.573" offset="26979725">May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that I can conclude my argument in a very a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6724.649" offset="27003967">I would like to attempt to clear up one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.645" offset="27019954">We have advanced the argument that a private property owner has the right to refuse admission to all of his property or a portion of his premises or to refuse service to anyone that he wishes and that this Court has never denied that he has that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6747.655" offset="27096022">And as a corollary that if he does have that right, he has the right to remove the person by his own physical force or in lieu thereof, to call upon law enforcement officials to act for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6759.736" offset="27144401">You have indicated in your questions that that is possibly acceptable as a legal proposition but that in the record you do not find facts which justify that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6773.261" offset="27198422">With respect to the Hoston case which is Kress' Department Store and Briscoe case which is the Post House Restaurants, in both records, you will find testimony in the case of Hoston, the Kress' store by the manager that he asked them to leave, that he told them they would not be served at one counter, but would be served at another counter that he feared a disturbance and that he himself called the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="6802.339" offset="27314824">In the Briscoe case, you find the testimony of the waitress that she told them they would not be served at one counter, but would be served at the other counter and that “we” as she put it, called the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="6815.568" offset="27367696">In both of those records, you find the man indicating the owner of the business or his agents, indicating that he did not wished to serve these people at that particular portion of his premises, and that he would prefer for them to go to another portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6831.119" offset="27429867">Then, in the furtherance of that request, you find that he called the police to carry out -- carry it out for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6840.433" offset="27467170">The police came at his request.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.456" offset="27479291">They asked these persons to leave the lunch counter where the manager, the owner had already indicated he did not want them to be and it was only after they refused again to leave, the lawful direction of the police officer made at the request of the property owner that they would finally arrested and charged with disturbing the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="6863.489" offset="27559330">We submit that at the very least in the Hoston record and in the Briscoe record, you have evidence to justify the conclusion that the manager or the owner of the property requested them to leave that particular area of his store and that in order to accomplish that request, he called the police department and asked them to carry it out for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6883.884" offset="27640936">Now, in the Garner case, as Mr. Chief Justice pointed out, you do not have the call from the manager or owner of the store to the police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="6893.915" offset="27681061">You have the statement by the owner that he has never had facilities in his restaurant for the colored race.</text>
            <text syncTime="6901.624" offset="27711885">He had only facilities for the one and that he asked these -- told all these people that they would not be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="6907.093" offset="27733828">We submit that in the Garner case, the worst that could be said of it is perhaps that the police officer acted somewhat precipitously in trying to carry out his responsibility to prevent violence and disordering his community, but in the Hoston and the Briscoe cases, we submit that in the record itself, you have ample evidence of the request by the owner to leave this particular area of his store and to move to another area and when they refused to do so, a request by the owner of the lawful -- law enforcement authorities to carry out, to come assist him in carrying out his request.</text>
            <text syncTime="6943.113" offset="27877919">They then requested that these people leave and only after they were refused were the arrest then made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6950.399" offset="27906968">We think those two cases clearly come within the statute and that the convictions should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6957.197" offset="27934239">We submit that in the Garner case, even without that facet of it, that the police officer and in line with the cases we cited, People versus Arko and People versus Nixon and the others that the police officer had the authority to act to prevent violence, that he had a right to foresee the possible violence it could result and that his request that they leave under these circumstances was not unreasonable and should have been obeyed and that their failure to obey the order amounted to a disturbance of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="6990.055" offset="28065688">In conclusion, I would say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6999.927" offset="28105080">If I could, I would pull briefly from the editorial in the Morning Advocate at the time that these sit-in demonstrations occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="7010.640" offset="28148025">These are times that require understanding goodwill and patience regardless of how hard these things may sometimes come to some among us, the recognition and acceptance that really count cannot be hastened or (Inaudible) by any action that creates alarm, destroys goodwill or alienates the different groups in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="7031.776" offset="28232558">Our society may have its imperfections as do all things of human desire, but this is not the way improvements will be brought about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7042.086" offset="28273727">Time and orderly evolution can bring progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7045.678" offset="28288146">Force can bring none.</text>
            <text syncTime="7047.949" offset="28297237">We respectfully submit that in the interest of better relation between the races and the interest of reasonableness of peace and order, in the interest of all of the parties concerned, the shop owners, the demonstrators, the general public, these convictions should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7066.480" offset="28371320">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="7092.036" offset="28473616">Alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="7093.017" offset="28477482">Secondly, so far the reviewability by the State Supreme Court in this case, I think the state and the petitioners are now on agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="7103.759" offset="28520427">These cases came up to the State Supreme Court on writs of certiorari and the State Supreme Court held in these cases that the rulings of the District Judge on matters of law are not erroneous and so substantively passed upon the questions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7119.358" offset="28582808">The questions of fact in the case which they said they could not pass upon are so far as these cases are presented here, questions of law, indeed questions of constitutional law because as in the Thompson case, it indicates a complete lack of facts in the record -- indicates a denial of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7140.345" offset="28666817">And so, the cases are here on matters of law which the State Supreme Court has ruled upon and has said that it can rule upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="7149.547" offset="28703598">I'd like briefly to refer to the Hoston record about which the state has made some reference and the testimony of the owner appears on page 30 of the record and makes quite clear just what he said, what he did and why he called the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="7167.528" offset="28775487">“After I finished my meal, I went to the telephone and called the police department.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7171.337" offset="28790742">“Why did you call the police department?”</text>
            <text syncTime="7173.489" offset="28799415">“Because I fear that some disturbance might occur.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7176.360" offset="28810909">“Why did you fear that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="7177.454" offset="28815193">“Because it isn't customary for the two races to sit together and eat together.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7181.676" offset="28832120">So he didn't call the police to arrest anybody and he didn't call the police because there was an actual disturbance or any appearance of any disturbance that was beginning to brew up.</text>
            <text syncTime="7191.929" offset="28873185">He just called the police as a cautionary measure and certainly not to eject these people from the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="7200.199" offset="28906203">In fact, he didn't even -- this is in record in which he did not even asked them to go to the counter on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="7205.688" offset="28928146">He was content to permit them to sit where they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="7209.963" offset="28945283">I think the state's argument in this case now has been made entirely clear in that the state agrees with the police officer as they testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="7221.067" offset="28989691">The court -- the trial court as expressed in its findings and implicitly the State's Supreme Court as it affirmed the trial court because the argument of the respondent here has been that the petitioners had no right to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="7236.352" offset="29050817">That was repeated over and over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="7238.956" offset="29061266">The petitioners had no right to be there and we submit that that is what this case presents to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7246.113" offset="29089896">The State of Louisiana was faced with a situation which involved the sit-in demonstrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7251.811" offset="29112675">The state as a matter of state policy expressed in a resolution as recently as 1960, the policy of the State is segregation, statement of its Governors as recently as 1960, that he will preserve segregation in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="7265.603" offset="29167846">General terms, looked around to see what it could find to apply to stop this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7273.329" offset="29198775">It didn't have a trespass statute even if a trespass statute would not be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7278.362" offset="29218837">Mr. Ward admits that the tres -- trespass statute would not apply to the situation, had nothing else reached around and got this very general disturbing the peace statute, invented around to try to fit this situation in an effort to perpetuate the public policy of the State of Louisiana as expressed by its legislature at its most recent session.</text>
            <text syncTime="7301.026" offset="29309534">And we respectfully submit that this is something which the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not permit to be done.</text>
