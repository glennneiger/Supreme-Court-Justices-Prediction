            <text syncTime="21.158" offset="190004">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="27.263" offset="214455">This is another expatriation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.145" offset="225949">Appellee Joseph H. Cort was denied a passport by the Secretary of State on the ground that he had expatriated himself under Section 349(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 by remaining outside of the jurisdiction of the United States in time of national emergency for the purpose of evading military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.769" offset="328453">When the case was here last Spring, this Court decided that the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain appellee’s suit for a judgment declaring that he is a citizen and enjoining the Secretary from denying him a passport on the ground that he is not and the Court held that Section 360 (b) and (c) of the Act did not provide the exclusive procedure by which he could attack an administrative determination that he was not a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.771" offset="448512">The Court ordered the merits of the case reargued and so today there is squarely presented for decision the constitutionality of Section 349 (a)(10), which is the statutory successor to Section 401(j) of the Nationality Act of 1940, whose constitutionality is at issue in the Mendoza-Martinez case just argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.636" offset="547986">The facts are essentially undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.005" offset="565436">Cort was born in Boston in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.239" offset="578393">On turning 18 in 1945 he registered under the regular Selective Service Act and shortly thereafter was classified 4(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="127.171" offset="614128">He later registered under the Universal Training and Service Act of 1948 and under that Act was classified 3(a) and subsequently 2(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="136.871" offset="652894">Then he attended the Yale Medical School from, which he received the MD degree in 1951, June 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.447" offset="687167">Shortly prior to graduation in May 1951, he registered under the Doctors Draft Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.281" offset="718514">In that same month, May 1951, he departed for England to accept a research fellowship at the University of Cambridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.770" offset="760519">In September 1952, while he was still in England on that fellowship --</text>

            <text syncTime="177.247" offset="814435">It appears that there was a little bit of confusion in his mind at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.460" offset="839304">The time for him to register had not yet arrived when he registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.357" offset="854873">You see he left actually before graduation, before he was an MD.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.068" offset="881727">He got the -- he discussed the matter with the local draft board, also discussed it with the draft advisor at Yale.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.924" offset="965110">Now there is a bit of a problem in that he -- his registration was actually with -- his registration, his regular registration under the regular draft was with a Board in Brookline, Massachusetts, which was not informed of this, but we do not regard that as bearing on his intention in leaving.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.601" offset="1091856">That's right Your Honor, we don't contend otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.254" offset="1118396">As I say in 1952 September, while he was still in England, he was classified by his local board in Massachusetts as 1 A medical.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.045" offset="1161550">Later in that same year he received an offer of a position as an instructor in physiology at Harvard Medical School.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.756" offset="1200421">In December of 1952, he wrote a letter to the authorities at Harvard accepting the position and indicating that he had obtained transportation to return to Massachusetts, to the United States in June 1951, excuse me, in June 1953 and that he would be prepared to start work in July or August at the medical school.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.946" offset="1305224">On the same day, he wrote to the Massachusetts Medical Advisory Committee, which was an organ that was assisting the draft boards in their operations under the Doctors' Draft Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.228" offset="1354334">He wrote back to the committee, requesting a deferment from military service on the ground that his teaching position at Harvard would be essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.957" offset="1401250">However, the authorities at Harvard, after considering the question, decided that the teaching position could not be justified as essential and they notified the Massachusetts Advisory Committee of that fact and they also notified Mr. Cort.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.146" offset="1478050">Thereupon the advisory committee recommended to the Selective Service Authorities, that Cort be considered available for active military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.677" offset="1516084">And in February 1953, Cort was sent a notification by his home draft board that his request for deferment had been rejected and ordering him to report for a physical examination either at home or at an examining facility at Frankfurt Am Main in Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.036" offset="1601557">Cort received this order, but he failed to obey it.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.380" offset="1618902">During the Spring of 1953, Cort exchanged several letters with the authorities at Harvard who --</text>

            <label>Mr. J. William Doolittle</label>
            <text syncTime="389.336" offset="1662788">He was told to report either at home or in Germany for a physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.126" offset="1685880">In the Spring of 1953 Cort and the authorities at Harvard exchanged several letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.115" offset="1705838">The authorities at Harvard noted the desperate need of the military services for physicians and explaining why they couldn't hold his position to be essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.313" offset="1750664">They suggested perhaps he might wish to seek a military commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.671" offset="1768114">Cort ended the correspondence with Harvard in 1953 with the statement that his application for a position would have to remain on file.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.377" offset="1810954">In June 1953, the local draft board again ordered Cort to report for a physical, this time at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.894" offset="1841048">Then in July it ordered him to report for a physical in Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.637" offset="1855990">Then in August 1953 it ordered him to report for induction at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.700" offset="1880231">Cort received each of these orders and failed to obey each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.710" offset="1900293">Approximately one year later, in August 1954, upon the failure of the British Government to renew his residence permit, Cort traveled to Czechoslovakia where, in his words, he took political asylum.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.945" offset="1965181">He did not travel on a valid American passport because his passport expired in 1952 and he did not get it extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.996" offset="2001439">He was admitted to Czechoslovakia as a stateless person, presumably on his own representation to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.856" offset="2040832">Now later this same year, 1954, he was indicted in the District of Massachusetts for failing to report for induction into the armed forces as ordered and that indictment is still pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.786" offset="2092554">On taking up his residence in Czechoslovakia, Cort was employed by the Institute for Cardiovascular Research, which is an organ of the Ministry of Health of the Czechoslovak Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.086" offset="2149815">He lived in Prague with his wife and his two children were born in Czechoslovakia during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.003" offset="2185446">I might note at this point that his two children are American citizens and as far as I can determine not Czechoslovak citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.056" offset="2221599">Almost five years later, in April 1959, Cort applied for an American passport at Prague.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.494" offset="2263395">Six months later this application was denied by the State Department on the ground that Cort had expatriated himself under Section 349(a)(10) of the 1952 Act, and this finding was affirmed by the department's Passport Board of Review after a hearing in December 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.749" offset="2340404">Thereupon Cort instituted this suite against the Secretary of State for declaratory judgment and an injunction in March 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.889" offset="2373005">A three-judge court was convened to hear his constitutional arguments and in October 1960 the court issued its decision, in which it held first, that the government was required to prove that Cort had committed an expatriating act by clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.846" offset="2444790">That the government had met that burden in demonstrating that Cort's purpose in remaining outside of the United States had been for the purpose of evading military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.176" offset="2482092">However, the court held that Section 349(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 is unconstitutional, feeling compelled so to hold as a result of this Court's opinions in Trop against Dulles.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.953" offset="2537263">This case is here on direct appeal by the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.340" offset="2554817">I might add just as a footnote before I proceed to my argument that in fact a passport was issued to Mr. Cort by the State Department, in January 1961, but he has not yet returned to United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.049" offset="2613645">Now we submit first that there is no question, but that Cort committed the act, that Section 349(a)(10) makes an expatriating act and the only factual issue as to which there was any disputes, the three-judge District Court unanimously found and I quote, “We are convinced that his purpose was to avoid service in the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.205" offset="2710194">The appellee does not in his brief at least seem seriously to challenge this finding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="658.687" offset="2740182">We don't believe that there is any basis for challenging and as I said in December 1952, Cort conveyed to the authorities at Harvard his plans to return including the fact that he had obtained transportation to return.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.153" offset="3214043">Yes sir, but her citizenship alone is sufficient to acquire for them American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.800" offset="3256571">There are certain requirements, which I assume have been fulfilled in order for this to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.407" offset="3279036">I might say she has to have lived ten years in the United States of which five were after the age of 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.246" offset="3306412">Now from the fact of the record that we can tell about her, I'm quite sure that, that was the case with Mr. Cort.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.072" offset="3353746">I was covering the -- in very summary form the basis for the government's contention that there is no question, but that Mr. Cort did commit the expatriating act.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.159" offset="3406096">As I say, in December 1952 he indicated that he had already made plans and arrangements for transportation to return in June 1953 and on the same day, this is the 29th of December in 1952, knowing his service obligation, having been informed that he was classified 1 A medical he sought a deferment.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.876" offset="3496897">Now in February 1953 when that deferment was denied and he was ordered to report when he saw that he in fact was going to be called upon to fulfill his obligations, then suddenly everything changed and from then on he made it quite clear that he had no intention whatever of coming back and we submit that this series of circumstances could not be more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.265" offset="3594491">Now he has suggested a number of reasons why he allegedly remained in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.563" offset="3623643">For one thing he suggests that he believes the -- he believed at that time that the induction order was not issued in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.896" offset="3653005">Now we submit that the circumstances under which, as he well knew the induction order, or I should say originally the order to report for a physical was issued, there could be no question of its good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.815" offset="3704728">He had applied for a deferment on the ground of the essentiality of his perspective employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.884" offset="3728969">He knew that the Harvard authorities in good faith denied the essentiality of the position and we submit the procedure from there on was so clearly regular that he was then -- his deferment was denied, he was ordered to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.444" offset="3803157">There could be no question, no serious questions as to the good faith with which the orders were issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.802" offset="3828652">He also contended that he didn't want to go back because he was afraid he would persecuted for his political associations, but up until the time he received the notice to report for a physical examination, he intended to go back whatever the consequences might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.421" offset="3895108">He also said that he thought that his physical disabilities under which he had originally been classified 4F back in 1945, would be such as to render him ineligible for military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.439" offset="3951219">However, he must have known the doctors were not being held to as high standards as others and in any event the best way to find out would have been to report to the physical and get that determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.762" offset="4000434">Appellee rests primarily on the challenge to the constitutionality of the statute which of course is the ground on which the government brought the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.846" offset="4044842">Now this challenge presents substantially the same questions as those involved in the Mendoza-Martinez case because Section 349(a)(10) is virtually identical to Section to 401(j) of the 1940 Act, slightly updated by the adding of the Air Forces to the Land and Naval Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.722" offset="4120283">The only notable difference is the addition in 1952 of the provision that if a person failed to comply with the compulsory service laws his absence from the United States is presumed to be for the purpose of evading military service. However, that presumption is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.334" offset="4190710">The District Court's decision was reached solely on the basis of the evidence actually in the case and the government does not rely on the presumption at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.440" offset="4231147">I would like to address myself to one way in which this case does differ from the Mendoza-Martinez case, and that is the fact that Cort lacks alternative citizenship, that is that if he is expatriated under Section 349(a)(10), he will be without citizenship in any country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.574" offset="4347758">I might note at the outset that in the government's view this fact has no bearing on applicability of the statute, the underlying problem with which the statute sought to deal is present whether the invader has alternative citizenship or not, and Congress evidenced no intention whatever in its own deliberations that the statute should be limited to one classification of citizens or another, the benefit shall be of course to citizens who are subject to the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.021" offset="4465518">We do submit that whatever difference it may make that Cort does not have an alternative citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.885" offset="4492999">The difference is more theoretical than real and it certainly is not a difference of constitutional proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.396" offset="4522987">Whatever banishment may have involved in Roman times, whatever outlawry may have involved in the middle ages, we submit that there is not the remotest basis for comparing those conditions with statelessness in the civilized world of today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.183" offset="4586203">Many studies, as both sides have pointed out, have been made in recent years on the problem statelessness, stemming largely from the problems of mass denationalizations in Europe, the problems of refugees and what not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.712" offset="4640225">But there is nothing in any of these studies to indicate any probability whatsoever that persons who lose their statelessness -- lose their American citizenship could become stateless persons, will in fact suffer serious hardship as a results of that stateless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.069" offset="4701665">Quite the contrary as a result of this increased interest in the problem of statelessness brought about not because of individuals like Mr. Cort, but by the problems of mass refugee migrations, significant efforts have been made by both national governments and international organizations to alleviate such problems as do remain in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.309" offset="4806677">We submit that this is where the problem belongs in the political organs of government and not in courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.121" offset="8449923">Well, that is certainly part of the foreign affairs power Your Honor, but the general foreign affairs power, for example the power to make executive agreements and generally to conduct negotiations with foreign states, that had to be considered as an inherent power of any sovereign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.431" offset="8531111">We submit that the alternatives available to a Congress wishing to deal with the serious problem created by the gross inequality of treatment that I refer to, forced Congress, the exercise of the foreign affairs powers of the government to adopt the alternative of expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.169" offset="8626092">The other alternatives as Mr. Terris has pointed out were simply not acceptable, would involve the government in embroilments with other states and that it could not afford particularly in wartime and therefore that it was reasonable for Congress to adopt the procedure of expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.995" offset="8701430">As in Perez the termination of the fugitive's citizenship terminates the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.700" offset="8724208">No more could gross inequality of service as between citizens of the United States sap the morale and effectiveness of the nation's fighting force, because those who would abandon their country no longer had citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.721" offset="8784290">Also as in Perez, there are elements of a transfer of allegiance in this act of expatriation; that Congress might quite reasonably regulate under its inherent power over citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.962" offset="8833296">Here we have a citizen abandoning his country, relinquishing his allegiance to this country in the time of its greatest need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.194" offset="8866210">We have that act and then in addition we have the act of his interposing between himself and his own country, the sovereignty and protection of another country and we suggest that this is a genuine transfer of allegiance such that Congress clearly has the inherent power to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.649" offset="8948025">We submit that there is no due process infirmity in Dr. Cort's expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.460" offset="8987209">Dr. Cort's citizenship was tried out in a full de novo judicial trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.400" offset="9011033">The government had the burden of proof, the burden of proving that he had committed an expatriating act, and a high burden it is; clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence that does not leave the issue in doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.043" offset="9069547">This is a standard that is closely akin to the criminal standard and we submit that it fully satisfies all requirements of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.911" offset="9109044">We submit too that this act of expatriation, this provision making departure from the country to evade military service is not a punitive act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.832" offset="9160767">We believe that its independent derivation to meet a specific wartime problem bespeaks its independent basis and its independent regulatory purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2370.768" offset="9588443">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.114" offset="9609864">There are as we see it four issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.356" offset="9630866">First is the fundamental constitutional issue, that is whether or not Congress can take away citizenship by reason of a person remaining abroad for purposes of avoiding the draft particularly, although not necessarily limited to the factual situation here, where he is an American citizen by birth and where the result would be to leave him stateless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.181" offset="9762105">This would be, if the Court were to reverse the Court below on the basic constitutional issue, the first case in the history of this country where an American citizen by birth was deprived of his citizenship through an act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.242" offset="9838383">The second issue still before the Court despite the absence of comment by the District Court, is whether or not the presumption is a valid one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.049" offset="9885612">Since I think we shall be able to show the Court that the presumption here was the basis of the decision which expatriated Dr. Cort, namely the decision of the Nationality Board and the Department of State, and since absent the presumption, we think there is an absence of clear and convincing evidence under the Mishawaka doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.727" offset="10000342">Our third point is of course that there is no clear and convincing evidence and the fourth is reliance upon the Huber and the Kurtz case, because in those cases, in one directly and in the other by adoption, the principle was laid down that constitutionally one could not be given a punishment such as the loss of citizenship under the 1865 Statute in that case, without a trial, whether it was a trial by a civil court or a military court, but a trial and not by a government administrative agency, an ad hoc group appointed in the Department of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.777" offset="10184558">While I have the highest regard for the individual members of that board, before which I appeared, they still do not represent a Court under our judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.704" offset="10224264">And now I want to briefly turn to the facts, because although I had intended to rest principally on the constitutional arguments and to show what has not yet been shown today, although it was so ably shown earlier by Mr. Davis in his first argument, that the 1865 Statute dealt with two problems; desertion and draft evasion and that the disposition of this Court in Trop necessarily required the same decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.413" offset="10371072">But on a rereading of the record and a recognition of the fact that not only this case, but it is conceivable that the preceding case maybe decided on facts or could be decided on facts less than the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.476" offset="10447350">I think I must address myself to the facts insofar as they have not yet been brought out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2604.401" offset="10523000">Dr. Cort, as the record shows and this is hardly a defense, is and was from a very early age an eminent physiologist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.588" offset="10559781">He went to England not for the purpose of avoiding the draft, but for purposes of research work in the field in which he is extraordinarily competent and internationally known in the field of kidneys and physiology.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.497" offset="10623415">While he was there, he did have correspondence with Harvard Medical School and here the government is slightly in error as to the dates, because it was before he received his draft or notice, that Harvard suggested to him and Your Honors will read the record here, that there was not much point said Harvard in his coming there since although his department head thought he was necessarily and should be free from the draft, other people, the acting being different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.164" offset="10766043">And so before he received the notice of February 9, 1953; the notice sent on that day and the Court will take judicial notice, it takes several days to get to England.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.949" offset="10825185">On January 31 the future head of Dr. Cort's department, this appears at 138 of the record, wrote him and said he thought it inadvisable for Dr. Cort to take the job and Dr. Cort concurred by letter dated February 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.544" offset="10911598">Then came the various notices and we have said we received those notices, although we have not stipulated as to when they were received, the notice is to report for examination and then finally came the last notice, the significant one upon which the indictment is based, that of August 13, 1953 directing Dr. Cort to report of induction on September 14, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.366" offset="11010863">Now faced with this, what did the Board of Nationality Review do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.658" offset="11048061">It said that on December 29, 1952 Dr. Cort intended to teach at Harvard, and that there was no evidence that he had changed his mind between December 29, 1952 and February 9, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.125" offset="11121936">And therefore said the Board of Nationality Review, we rely upon the presumption that in remaining away in disregard of draft board notices, Dr. Cort remained away for the purpose of avoiding the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.518" offset="11195496">The Board apparently as I have just looked at the original record, and I will confirm it tomorrow, did not have before it, the correspondence with Harvard, which would have explained that Dr. Cort did not on when he first received the draft board notice intend to go to Harvard because about ten days before that Dr. Cort had been told by Harvard that it didn't want him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.581" offset="11299777">This was an administrative board hearing, it moved principally with oral argument from me and a few exhibits, and it is quite understandable, quite aside from the constitutional problems involved, that the Board was a little, shall we say sloppy at it's handling the problem and didn't have all the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.398" offset="11362994">It was later on when the matter came to the District Court that the government came out with the few more exhibits, the correspondence with Harvard, which clarified the Harvard picture, but hardly showed that Dr. Cort was remaining abroad for the purposes of avoiding the draft and so when the Court of Appeals and the District Court.</text>
