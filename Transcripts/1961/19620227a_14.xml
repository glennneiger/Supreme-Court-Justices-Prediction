            <label>Mr. Hubert D. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="24.677" offset="202062">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.493" offset="225364">The two cases appeals by the two banks have been consolidated same issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.736" offset="262353">I will, as the attorney for appellant in number 90, held the opening -- opening fully rebuttal period used by Mr. Leachman representing the appellants in Number 91.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.425" offset="337063">This case -- or these cases present an issue that does not seem to have been before the Supreme Court of United States in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.515" offset="405400">A suit was brought in a state court in Travis County, Texas by the receiver of ICT Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.043" offset="451584">Many defendants of 144 the pleading indicates, two of them or two national banks with offices established in Dallas, Texas, Dallas County, Texas approximately 200 miles away from Travis County, which Travis County is a state capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.832" offset="538728">The two banks thought that they had a right to have venue of actions against them in the state court in their home county where they were established.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.588" offset="593690">They each filed the type of pleading that the state practice calls for setting up this claim of right of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.386" offset="632874">In Texas, we call it a plea of privilege so designated.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.311" offset="648652">It's been called a privilege by -- towards allover the country and other town.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.185" offset="672162">We actually have a name for it that we call it a plea of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.357" offset="684805">It asserts a right of venues.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.188" offset="696090">The receiver of the insurance company controverted said “No, we have a right to maintain venue in the court here in Austin, in the state court here in Austin because there is a state statute that gives venue of actions by or against a receiver of an insolvent insurance company in the state court in Austin, in the state court”.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.648" offset="801938">There's no question of jurisdiction of a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.683" offset="826075">There's no argument in this case that it ought to be in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.887" offset="846869">The argument pertains to where the venue should be and whether or not the venue right that was contained in the original National Bank Act of 1864 and was apparently inadvertently omitted in 1873 revised statute and then reinstated in the 1875 Act to correct errors and omissions confers that right on these two national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.388" offset="968913">And on the opposite side of that, the receiver Mr. Langdeau says that this state statute is controlling overrides, takes away the right or that the right doesn't exist which is another way of saying the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.599" offset="1041742">Now, the Court's notation in this case, noted it was postponing jurisdiction to consideration for the day along with the merits and that outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.341" offset="1088763">I would like to talk a little bit about the jury -- about the jurisdiction phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.312" offset="1112586">The venue hearings under our state practice, and I don't think its uncommon practice, or the issue as to ju -- venue here are joined by the filing of a plea of privilege and by the filing of a controverting affidavit and then an issue is drawn and the court hears that and here its first.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.374" offset="1204851">It's a separate venue trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.774" offset="1218435">There were two.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.116" offset="1223868">In this instance, they were heard consolidately because they were the same basic issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.830" offset="1254693">Both banks, admittedly national banks, both banks owned the offices in Dallas direct clash between the state statute and the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.986" offset="1303280">That was the issue that was before the Travis County District Court when it was appealed from that court to the Austin Court of Civil Appeals, the intermediate Court of Civil Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.833" offset="1354689">There was a stipulation filed in the record showing that that had been the only issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.213" offset="1380185">There was no dispute as to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.010" offset="1391365">It was a dispute as to the clash between the two laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.587" offset="1413726">The Austin Court of Civil Appeals said that they thought that the federal statute was clear and controlling and said that the venue should be transferred to District Courts in Dallas County Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.890" offset="1474957">State District Courts in Texas, by the way by Texas constitution have jurisdiction of all damage suits seeking damages in excess of $ 1000.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.810" offset="1514663">So this was a $15,000,000 tort damage suit as the very lengthy pleading shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.500" offset="1545383">And so that was the order judgment, judgments entered by the Austin Court of Civil Appeals, a single opinion written in the two cases because they presented the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.250" offset="1592404">In the Supreme Court of Texas, took the case, the cases is up, heard them again consolidatedly handed down judgments said that the state statute was controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.969" offset="1647261">We say that it leaves the federal statute as meaningless and having no meaning with reference to any proceeding of the state court and that was all court they were then passing on although it has two pieces, both relating to venue one and venue or proceedings in federal courts, one venue in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.844" offset="1734719">Now, the only jurisdictional objection or issue that's been drawn in issue is this to whether or not the judgments are final within the framework of the introductory phrases to Section 1257 dealing with appeals from final judgments of the state court of last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.360" offset="1832835">And we've called the state court of last resort, I think, the record clearly shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.426" offset="1853106">We've had our motion of rehearing overruled withdraw in the state court on this venue issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.920" offset="1887065">We -- in our brief looked at this, we feel act carefully and they looked clear all due regard to the decisions of this Court on the interpretation of final, both in Section 1257 and in Section 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.718" offset="1970239">And we've gone back and check as best we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.032" offset="1983509">And they seem to mean the same thing and the same policy standards of their print.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.452" offset="2005138">The case, it seems to us to be most clearly in point was the case of -- in the Cohen versus Mutual Benefit that came up under Section 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.802" offset="2070549">It was subsequently followed in Swift and Company versus Compania Columbiana whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.654" offset="2093955">I can't pronounce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.363" offset="2096776">I'm not very good in Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.458" offset="2105240">But it was followed in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.341" offset="2120704">It's a rather narrow -- narrow aperture.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.872" offset="2138885">It's not open just every time you have a temporary provisional tentative phase of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.139" offset="2175979">But there's nothing temporary or provisional about this under the state court practice, which is where we were in the commissions that we have to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.698" offset="2222164">The venue trial was a separate trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.664" offset="2238046">There had to be an appeal from it within 20 days from the order or else it was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.737" offset="2262288">The Supreme Court of Texas holds that it is not appeal from, it's waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.804" offset="2298546">The determination is res judicata as to venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.939" offset="2319130">It's no longer within the control of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.332" offset="2340655">They have even po -- held that at the end of the term and we just have two-month terms to this courts that the court can't even on its own motion make the change.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="569.747" offset="2382346">Let me see if I understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.782" offset="2390497">After a challenge of the venue has been overruled, there is no way under your law to preserve the point, were you -- did you come in, except by appeal, if you come in and defend even though over protest you still have waived venue?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hubert_d_johnson" startTime="594.161" stopTime="657.381">
            <label>Mr. Hubert D. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="594.161" offset="2480044">That's the thrust of these holdings of the Supreme Court of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.879" offset="2498853">It was an exception in the early days that it commented on.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.224" offset="2512227">And I would not be -- I'd be less than frank but it mentioned it where you had a case that proceed immediately to trial on the merits disposed them for the same term, you can bring them up together but that was a situation in which you could perfect your appeal from the total within the 20 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.385" offset="2596864">It's a very narrow, not available in 144 defendant case, not available in hardly any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.013" offset="2631450">But conceivably, during might be convene to pass on the venue issue, the court might overruled it, go right ahead to try two or three-daytime could be brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.724" offset="2670320">That's the only condition under which you would be safe in bringing the whole case up together in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.155" offset="2703966">Otherwise, the courts hold that you have a right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.921" offset="2719013">You must appeal if you want to continue to complain.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="657.381" stopTime="664.097">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="657.381" offset="2732910">In the case you mention, that would be a sort of a dual appeal and both are within the prescribed time.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hubert_d_johnson" startTime="664.097" stopTime="680.651">
            <label>Mr. Hubert D. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="664.097" offset="2759764">Both within the prescribed time.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.026" offset="2767496">You would have to beat it to the gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.737" offset="2774288">You'd have -- you'd have to stay within the time limits because it's sort of -- of an exception to the statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.952" offset="2807202">It was now expressed in court rules but it -- it was one time expressed in statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="680.651" stopTime="684.479">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="680.651" offset="2826010">Of course, the fact that this is final under the Texas law, it doesn't mean that it's final.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hubert_d_johnson" startTime="684.479" stopTime="1342.246">
            <label>Mr. Hubert D. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="685.173" offset="2844087">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.970" offset="2847222">That is absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.707" offset="2854222">And that's the reason that we have gone to careful consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.176" offset="2876061">We think careful consideration of the Radio Station WOW versus Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.438" offset="2905109">The cases that get into this area of certain segregated or partial issues unrelated to other issues such as the Cohen case and the Swift and Company case, cases that went the other ways such as Republic Natural Gas Company versus Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.655" offset="2989955">But it seems to me in fairness to say that -- that court recog -- the court recognized that this was not some sort of an arbitrary of technical matter and that you did have to make a choice between certain realities.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.516" offset="3065396">The cases that I find it -- have emphasized the fact that it's a federal court application intended to be cases that where the state court was trying to claim some degree of lack of finality in the appellate process such as the Richfield Oil Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.211" offset="3144182">And I believe one of the others Arnold -- no, not Arnold case the Marquestry Railroad case where there was a power of review to me that came up in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.351" offset="3188799">And there was a continued power of review and the question was “Is this really final now or do we have to wait until that last power of review is -- is exhausted?”</text>
            <text syncTime="781.184" offset="3228087">But I -- I think that we -- we realize and we say in our brief and we recognized that all this Texas practice is not controlling on its court but it goes to consideration of the finality in fact and the fact that you have complete finality as a completely practical matter and that there is no other way to find out if you can be tried in Dallas County under -- under Texas practice except just to go head on in -- in Travis County.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.475" offset="3393285">And you probably would not have any right of complaint at all in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.730" offset="3406242">I know you would, whether you adhere confront the argument that where you had a final judgment and you didn't appeal timely that worried in some, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.992" offset="3443336">And you -- you have to be right on -- on the timely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.701" offset="3466219">The -- we made a -- a very lengthy and critical comparison of it with the standards that were describe in the Cohen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.874" offset="3502895">The formality, the being a formal judgment, being conclusive of the issue, the being separable from and collateral to and we're not merged into the judgment distinguishing from the Montgomery Trades Council case involving a temporary injunction where the issue is still before the Court on final injunction hearing as the same set of facts still subject to the provisional review and control of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.998" offset="3635388">And frankly, on the basis of what we consider a fairly careful analysis of this matter, we believe this Court that this is -- these are final judgments that the necessary element of finality is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.414" offset="3709053">And this Court does have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.577" offset="3721697">Now, we approach the question discussing many of these landmark cases with some fair accreditation because they're the court's own cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.556" offset="3765582">And they interpret them in a way but we tried to put things out and put together we think the cases in our brief that are pertinent to the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.720" offset="3810304">We believe that they established the finality that's required.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.300" offset="3856593">Turning briefly to the interpretation of a statute, the question of whether we have the right, the statute which we quote in our brief was Section 57 of the National Bank Act 1864.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.342" offset="3928691">And it deals with actions and proceedings against national banks in specified federal courts and in specified state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.316" offset="3988668">The 1863 Act, which just had a tenure of a little bit more than a year which authorized the formation of national banking associations took a completely different approach to it and referred to a proceedings by or against national banking associations in specified federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.888" offset="4082918">You'll find a complete divergence of change in approach in the 1864 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.399" offset="4108936">The 1873 revision, for some reasons that is not apparent, did not include this particular Section 57 of the National Bank or anything -- Bank Act or anything like it but there were a number things that were left out in the 1873 revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.721" offset="4198275">And couple years later, in 1875, they were -- an act was passed to correct errors and omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.511" offset="4225442">And this was put back some potentially the same language that it had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.184" offset="4248116">It's probably not necessary to say whether or not it was ever dropped out the law or not, it's been referred to frankly as having been a part of the law since 1864 without -- without interruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.884" offset="4294928">The first case that came along to construe this was a state court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.188" offset="4332126">A case up in New York Court, Cook case which is cited in our brief about 1867 and it said, well this is just permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.919" offset="4367026">You can sue anywhere in the state notwithstanding what it said on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.779" offset="4390536">Couple of years later, the Massachusetts Court, they wrote a case called Crocker versus Marine National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.662" offset="4418017">In the Crocker case, arrived to just the exact opposite result of the New York Court said that this had to mean must under this context and otherwise it did not mean anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.734" offset="4474337">So, purpose meaningless if you put in the period of permissive form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.002" offset="4495339">And about 1871, there was a case that called Bank of Bethel versus Pahquioque Bank which was a suit in a state court in Connecticut that went on up and came to this United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.597" offset="4565765">And in that case, the court adverted to the statute said that the suit had been brought in a proper state court, state court had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.051" offset="4607561">It would mention that is was a court that was a court of competent jurisdiction simply apply the statute verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.501" offset="4637341">In 1880, this came before this Court again in Casey versus Adams, which was a case that came up to the state courts in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.032" offset="4683525">It came and arose under the Louisiana form of statute that dealt with determining priorities or classifying rates -- ranks of privileges the way they use it in the civil code statute where a mortgage foreclosure had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.868" offset="4762833">The money was in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.868" offset="4770879">Who was to get the money?</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.544" offset="4777566">The state statute there said that it -- this court was the only one that had the power or jursisdiction to make this determination and only on this national bank said that the New Orleans Court was the only one with jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.507" offset="4845380">It came to the United States Supreme Court and United States Supreme Court in Casey versus Adams apparently look at the statute, gave it a construction said that this was a typical interim proceeding, an action which was classified as a local action which was old as action themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.992" offset="4935346">And that, it was their opinion that this statute was not designed to apply to such typically local actions as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.408" offset="4981008">In the next case that came before this Court and the key case as we see it is First National Bank of Charlotte, North Carolina versus Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.067" offset="5019669">Opinion was written in 1889 by Mr. Justice Harlan, the first Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.871" offset="5046836">It's a very interesting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.477" offset="5061256">The -- a bank, national bank in North Carolina was sued in a state court in North Carolina which was not in the county in which the court maintains this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.538" offset="5117576">They were sued and for them to recover this double penalty for exacting your jury's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.171" offset="5140041">The bank defendant lost his lawsuit on -- in the -- on the appeal in the Supreme Court of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.767" offset="5178389">For the first time, it said wait.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.472" offset="5189256">They couldn't say it sue us there anyway jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.906" offset="5203048">The court had no jurisdiction void judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.067" offset="5215692">The -- or one of their contentions they are making was that only a federal court would have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.519" offset="5241396">They were basing it on exclusive jurisdiction section of the Judiciary Act of 1789 dealing with suits to recover penalties under federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.398" offset="5280998">First they said that's wrong because the subsequent statute dealing with national banks was a later statute and modified that feature of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.728" offset="5322271">Then they said this state court was not the right state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.653" offset="5342020">The Supreme Court of United States had to decide what was the nature of this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.263" offset="5360410">They cited the Crocker case, the early Massachusetts case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.242" offset="5372322">They cited the Bethel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.543" offset="5381517">They said that it was a personal privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.226" offset="5392280">It was written years before the (Inaudible) case, but it sounded a great deal of lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.867" offset="5414849">They say it was a waivable personal privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.073" offset="5427702">If it had been claimed it must have been granted by the court -- the state court in which it had been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.610" offset="5453824">Now, that case continues to be and is the key case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1349.573" offset="5501680">They used afraid that if there was an exception that statute was an exception that it was an immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.303" offset="5536580">Pretty strong language has said no use speculating as to why Congress granted it so far as that it did grant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.718" offset="5570226">The Austin Court of Civil Appeals felt that that case was fully controlling on this federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.040" offset="5611499">The Supreme Court of Texas said we are not going to follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.968" offset="5635218">We consider that dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.820" offset="5650683">We don't think it was dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.757" offset="5658415">We think that it was right straight to answering the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.074" offset="5671685">The issue was what sort of a right does this statute grant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.769" offset="5686418">And the answer would agree, not jurisdiction, venue, a waivable right but if asserted it must be granted, must be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.645" offset="5729991">And thus, the (Inaudible) case, the key case that we feel has been disregarded by the Texas Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.424" offset="5797073">It's been disregarded in a number of other states, a lot of collection of state court cases in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.496" offset="5833331">We didn't do anything set put and in the appendix because we felt that only served to illustrate was the confusion among the various states and the almost extremes to which they have gone to try to make a clear statute into something that they could not apply and that's about all that they -- they seem to me to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.709" offset="5926222">There's a California case, the Monarch Wine Company case that we make particular reference to because it has such a thorough review of both state and federal court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.584" offset="5973661">The cases that have construed and applied this statute as to venue in the federal courts, which as I say is the first part of it have without exemptions said that it's -- unless there's a waiver or consent to be sued elsewhere the venue right in the federal court says is provided for since against the national banks has provided for right here in this Section and those cases come right on down to very recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.737" offset="6094346">The argument is -- has been made just briefly the subsequent after 1889.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.882" offset="6154951">There was a case in 1917 it -- before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.448" offset="6177207">First National Bank versus Fellows ex rel. Union Trust Company, a quo warranto proceeding brought on relation in the state capital in Michigan against the Bank -- National Bank having trust powers under Section 11 (k) of the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.971" offset="6259231">And that -- in that case the banks actual office, the place of business was not in the state capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.234" offset="6292355">In the state courts, there were no argument, no -- no point made of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.952" offset="6311163">It was not urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.482" offset="6317328">It was not even urged in the United States Supreme Court although a dissenting opinion went back and say we can consider a jurisdiction when it could -- should have been in -- in this particular situation would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.572" offset="6361631">Most the argument there was about whether not a Colorado type of proceeding -- was a type of proceeding that ought to be brought in the state court and whether it ought to be brought against the national bank or whether it ought to be brought exclusively in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.304" offset="6432580">In 1923 in Bank of Whitney versus Bank in America case, a national bank with offices in New Orleans was sued in a federal court in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.644" offset="6497991">They attacked jurisdiction that they weren't there and weren't doing business there and couldn't be sued there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.329" offset="6524740">It did not raise this venue right provide for under R.S. 5198 or Section 57 or is codified as 12 U.S.C. 94.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.176" offset="6584090">It didn't raise that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.862" offset="6590777">And so, in the United States Supreme Court, I think its Mr. Justice Brandeis wrote the opinion as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.895" offset="6630902">Are those -- excuse me, he concluded saying that we do not have to reach this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.963" offset="6655248">It's not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.234" offset="6660263">The jurisdiction point was there from the beginning was raised there such the absence of it's being present in the Federal District Court in New York, footnote to the opinion sites the statute R.S. 5198 cites First National Bank v. Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.587" offset="6741765">But it seems to me rather than declining to discuss it, he simply says there's another ground here that we do not have to go into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.807" offset="6770604">That's the only -- that's the only thing as so I read the case to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.666" offset="6786069">As far as I can tell and I think we made a careful search other than one or two cases where there's been advertence to the section in federal court cases Cope versus Anderson as I recall made advertence to the 12 U.S.C. 94.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.315" offset="6856600">But that's the -- that's the case law on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.179" offset="6872064">The -- in 1875, the United States -- the Congress made a very material amendment to the Judiciary Act conferring jurisdiction on federal courts in the area of so-called federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.550" offset="6965582">Apparently, prior to them and I was not aware that until I begin studying this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.296" offset="6980524">Diversity had been the basis of it and sole basis of it except where there had been special statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.490" offset="7013334">That also put provision and therefore removal on federal question -- basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.399" offset="7040920">And of course, in the light of some cases as had drawn the great deal of support from Osborn versus Second Bank of United States, you run in the situations where by virtue of federal origin, there was a basis for saying that any case involving brought by or against the National Bank was one that the bank could bring in the federal court if it wanted to and if it was sued as a defendant, it could be remove the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.649" offset="7157948">Well, that lead to some mandatory legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.364" offset="7168815">In 1882 Act first which was a kind of garble and then in 1887 and 1888 Act to clarify what they meant as four or five cases and if going down the line on that and made very clear and that, that was all addressed to the matter of jurisdiction not venue all addressed to the manner of clarifying the lack of availability of jurisdiction in the federal courts because of federal origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.371" offset="7292844">The cases discussed the famous Pacific Railroad removal cases which seem to point up the Pandora's box which had been opened by the 1875 Act at least sets away the -- you got a situation in which yes, you have state court jurisdiction but it could be ousted by removal by many of these railroad companies and all of the national banks and that have to be clarified in Petri versus Continental Bank and the Whitmore versus Amoskeag Bank and the Con -- Commercial National Bank versus -- Continental National Bank versus Buford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.752" offset="7446340">We cite a couple of those cases and they're all cited in the Petri case and in the Buford case, too, as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.029" offset="7475493">Make it put it clear as to what that amendatory legislation was driving at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.663" offset="7502033">It has never been construed to have any other effect in the 1948 rewriting of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.295" offset="7540590">The statute contained a lot of -- of things that were expressly repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.002" offset="7559398">And it stated among those expressly reapeal was this 1882, 1887, 1888 legislation that dealt with the same subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.464" offset="7593253">It's now in 28 U.S.C. 1348 as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.912" offset="7614986">And that is not to me indicative of any change in the clearer meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.185" offset="7664097">The local action thing, I'll revert to that a little bit more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.248" offset="7692413">This action here then exert contain in the pleading that takes up the first 321 pages of this record for which I would like to apologize in making the record so lengthy but I couldn't figure out how to present a case without pleading and I couldn't also figure out how to condense it because it was so difficult to -- to do that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.009" offset="7783424">But if you turn to the prayer portion of it, you'll see that it is a tort action based on a claim grand conspiracy, fraudulent conspiracy extending over from 1950 to 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.858" offset="7850820">144 parties and some of them apparently coming in and off the scene at one time and another seeking joint and several liability a claim for some $15 million, some special claims on special acts against the different defendants which are covered in the part b of the prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.813" offset="7930650">There's certainly nothing about it that suggests that it's anything other than the normal tort action, transitory in nature, be brought wherever you -- wherever you want to, nothing local in that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.943" offset="7991150">The statute that they refer to here that the State Supreme Court of Texas seem to rely so heavily on was this 1955 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.991" offset="8043290">There's nothing but a venue statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.204" offset="8052172">It refers to courts of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.137" offset="8063875">It was not planned to give any new jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.859" offset="8074846">Our jurisdiction is given by constitutional provision in Texas, District Courts, all land suits, all damage suits over a thousand dollars, the courts under $500, between $200 and $500 they had to be our county court wasn't changing any of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.045" offset="8143600">There's been a state court case in Texas holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.579" offset="8153736">And it was purely a venue statute that it even applied to existing facts and that it did not violate the provisional ex post facto theory because it was a procedural venue statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.655" offset="8221968">And it just took right over and applied a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.614" offset="8233880">It was brought after even those based on facts that are ruled before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.192" offset="8252165">The -- there's nothing that I can't see in the statute that purports to create any kind of an action or to make it local.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.746" offset="8298350">If you have an action against the receiver on a rejected claim, there is a section of the statute, Section 3 (h) of Article 21.28 that like so many instances and receivership statute says that you present your claim, one is denied then you sue in the receivership court but this is not that kind of an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.154" offset="8388002">It is just exactly the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.489" offset="8397302">The receiver who is suing the banks and many others for things that happened to the insurance company from 1950 to 1957 long prior to the receivership suing 28 or 30 parties that by the pleadings, allegations live outside the State are foreign corporations has not doing business in the State to get in personam jurisdiction is not going to be impossible in all probability to do it in the state district court there in Austin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.841" offset="8538781">I don't think that the local action claim stands on the basis of any common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.789" offset="8570546">The definition of local is transitory by its very nature by the definitions of this Court in some cases that we've cited by the definitions of the Texas Courts in cases that we've cited there and by all the literature that you could see on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.153" offset="8651943">The statute, this Insurance Code does not purport to create any locality of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.614" offset="8681827">And the Supreme Court of Texas say we don't pass on whether this is a local or transitory action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.096" offset="8707741">No indication that they were much impressed with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.750" offset="8726340">If I could just use a minute or two to summarize the opening, it is the position of the appellants in these cases which are here consolidated that the right given to them by the federal statute has been finally determined against them that the validity of the state statute is contracting with the applicability of the federal statute has been appealed, that it comes clearly within Section 1257 if it's final then it's final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.208" offset="8876178">It's final under all practical tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.479" offset="8889240">It's comes clearly within the test outlined in the Cohen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.251" offset="8908361">And it's, therefore, we feel that this is a case where jurisdiction of this Court can attach, should attach the -- there's no other place, no other way that this determination whether this right exist can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.336" offset="8988714">It's been -- we've gone the gamut in Texas and we've haven't been able to make it get into recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.010" offset="9035421">As to the merits phrase of it, we have a very clear statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.330" offset="9052662">It's a venue statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.868" offset="9062797">It's a valuable venue right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2477.772" offset="10014490">We have been through all of the Courts of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.591" offset="10021700">And there, there hasn't a court union yet the trying to file in we're going to try this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.396" offset="10045001">The two banks here are on the two defendants that were involved in a -- in a large case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.085" offset="10063705">There was a man by the name of Ben Jack Cage, a certainly co-conspirator whom we allege conceive the idea of forming a labor union, by forming an insurance company to be owned by labor unions which was an excellent idea except that Ben Jack Cage apparently had large in his heart rather than a public spirited undertaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.085" offset="10143744">Mr. Cage had occasion to appear before the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas and unsuccessfully appealing his 10-year conviction and is now taking sanctuary in Brazil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.012" offset="10195466">The banks being sued as co-conspirators and being in -- we allege that there are stopped to deny that they have not waived their right to the federal venue statute and then let me say at the very outset of this, if I may, sir, that we make no contention here and I've never made any contention that this Court cannot review state court action relating to federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.935" offset="10295150">We make no contention or did the State made any contention that the -- the national banks here are to be deprived of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.059" offset="10335587">I may say I make a further concession here, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.064" offset="10347604">I do not say that this -- that we can confer jurisdiction on a court by agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.787" offset="10366516">But I do agree with counsel that under Texas practice, for all purposes and I emphasize the word all, for all purposes, the determination of a venue issue is now final in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.389" offset="10412910">It is not final should this Court determine it does not have jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.728" offset="10430255">I think that that case can be brought along and eventually reach this Court at the conclusion of a hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.960" offset="10459199">But I say to Your Honors that insofar as Texas Courts are concerned, the venue question will never be litigated regardless of whether this Court takes the jurisdiction assuming it denied the jurisdictional question that they did not take jurisdiction.</text>
