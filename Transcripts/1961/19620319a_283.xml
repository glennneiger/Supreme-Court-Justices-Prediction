            <text syncTime="17.131" offset="171865">Your Honors, we are here concerned with the reversal by the Court of Appeals of the Jones Act seaman's verdict related to James Victor Salem who was a lookout able-bodied seaman aboard respondents S. S. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.923" offset="231111">We are also here concerned with a reversal of an award for future maintenance given by the trial judge on consent of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.909" offset="271026">The major issue involved here relates itself to whether the initial verdict on negligence and unseaworthiness was infirmed because of the failure of the plaintiff to present an expert on maritime architecture with respect to a simple issue of obvious danger and perhaps it would be best for us to formulate the issue in light of some of the facts involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.104" offset="375829">It seems that this S. S. United States at its record speed, coursing at a winter sea on February 16, 1958 was two days from the port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.628" offset="421909">They had in the fore part of the vessel a 65-foot hollow aluminum tower, known as a radar tower, consisting of several platforms.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.462" offset="461197">And the platform that was 31 feet above the deck would be the platform onto which the crow's-nest personnel would step while coming off an up and down ladder and then go into a bubble in the forward part of its radar tower to perform their function as lookout seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.158" offset="536012">Now, this tower was completely closed at the top and the only illumination provided were by five serially placed lights, one above the other, two of them above the crow's-nest, two below the crow's-nest level of 31 feet above and one at its parallel distance.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.868" offset="746872">And the manner in which they would get to this particular platform level would be to find an up and down ladder which is 15 inches wide or foot apart the rungs, and then they have to breach the open space, this manhole, by putting one foot behind them hoping to grab holes of a radar enclosure which is a rather bulky piece of a pertinence and then swing the other leg around and then walk towards the door which would lead into the bubble which was the radar -- which was the crow's-nest area in which also incidentally there was a telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.954" offset="887202">Well, as I say, they had these five lights and the two lights above the crow's-nest platform had been out for months prior to the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.418" offset="941014">The two lights below this crow's-nest platform were out when Mr. Salem came to work at 12 midnight on this day and it had been the subject of unsuccessful repair six days before without any follow check up by the electrician.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.080" offset="999737">So we are now faced with this vessel, seven degrees to port, six degrees stop and rolling in a rather rough sea with basic -- with passing the rain squalls, the vibration transposed to this particular radar tower using ordinary household bulbs instead of any vibration bulbs with the platform itself without any skid proof paint for friction for the seaman who will have to take this awkward and dangerous procedure of coming over, we see that at the time of the accident which was at 2:30 a.m., that last light went out.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.270" offset="1180400">Thousands of thousands of them, yes Your Honor, but this was done according to the chief porter master, by reason of the excessive vibration caused by the record speed of this vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.868" offset="1218853">And they use, as he said, ordinary household bulbs, 500 to 600.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.919" offset="1239019">We know that they -- for months, the upper two bulbs that would have cast illumination in a crow's-nest platform were out.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.216" offset="1264201">We know that the two bulbs below were out at least since 12 o'clock midnight when he came on duty and then our concern with something that happened at 2:30, when he came back from a coffee break and there was a relief lookout man by the name of Richards inside this crow's-nest.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.933" offset="1323133">As he came over unto this platform and before he could do anything further in walking towards the door, he slipped backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.328" offset="1360645">And remember, this platform itself was worn, no skid proof paint though falsely in answer to interrogatories the defendant said they had that and he struck the back of his head on the rungs of a ladder behind him.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.173" offset="1412054">He struck his lumbar area on the edge of the platform and he yelled for help and Richards came out groping for him and that was relief man f and asked him if he could sit there for a while, while he went into the crow's-nest to telephone the bridge and we show too that he could have reached him while holding the man and not had left him abandoned there.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.940" offset="1487182">And he left the man sit on a narrow ledge with his feet dangling over to this open space while he went inside the telephone and Salem passed out again and fell another distance into this hole and finally, he was rescued by the use of flashlights and testimonies to clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.394" offset="1556982">Well, while he was in the ship's hospital for two days, extensive medical notations were made by a doctor Fainger as to this man screaming with pain, immobilized in traction, given glucose, heartbeat irregular, pulse skipping beats, the man seemed to be paralyzed in one leg, dark circles around his eyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.963" offset="1643186">The reason I say this is because this particular hospital record, on the ship, was never furnished to the marine hospital when he got off the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.408" offset="1677040">Nor was it even shown to respondent's doctors when they -- until the day they testified in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.425" offset="1701073">All these then comes to as picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.731" offset="1714343">The trial judge charged that the jury may on negligence as well as on the warranty of seaworthiness find for the plaintiff if they found there was a failure to provide railings or other safety devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.515" offset="1781426">The Court of Appeals reversed the because in the majority opinion written by Judge Watkins concurring by Judge Friendly, Judge Smith dissenting, the plaintiff had the burden to show by a marine expert whether it was feasible to construct a railing or other safety device.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.178" offset="1860106">And further, they said there was no evidence to show that a railing or other safety device was necessary under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.416" offset="1889050">Well, clearly, with respect to the second part of this disjunctive reasoning of reversal, the testimony by Terry and Trible who were the other lookout seamen was that there was nothing to grab of hold of, nothing to bridge with over that space that the bulky radar enclosure was too big and that it wasn't safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.027" offset="1967522">The testimony of witnesses clearly showed that there was a need for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.966" offset="1983195">So the basic issue as I see it here is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.612" offset="1997824">In all future trials in maritime cases, is it required that a seaman produce an expert to prove to a jury that something he claims was unseaworthy or unsafe could have feasibly been safe or made safe by construction or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.221" offset="2072221">In other words, if there was a defective piece of rope, a simple thing like that and the plaintiff says, “That rope parted”, can he succeed now unless he shows by an expert that feasibly they could have made a good piece of rope.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.970" offset="2123212">I say the issue was that simple because we are here concerned with an open hole in complete darkness in a vibrating tower and to say that a lifeline or a platform with skid proof paint or bulbs that should have not blown out the anti-vibration bulbs are subjects of expert testimony is the equivalent of saying that a jury is not fit to pass on a simple factual issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.873" offset="2230836">And now, I turn to the test as I see it, as annunciated by this Court in the Winans case and in the Kellogg case and also set down by leading text on the subject of expert testimony what are the tests to determine that should go to a jury without expert testimony and that which a jury composed of a lay and uneducated mind can properly determine in the absence of an expert?</text>
            <text syncTime="558.008" offset="2335431">Well, you don't produce experts when you have ordinary standards of conduct of safety or danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.050" offset="2363538">You don't need an expert when there's an operation of well-known natural laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.066" offset="2379630">You don't need an expert when there's an existence of a custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.337" offset="2392691">You don't need an expert even though the expert may know more of the subject than the juror himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.516" offset="2421426">And this Court stated in the Milwaukee against Kellogg case of 94 Supreme Court, it is a matter of observation on which the lay mind is capable of forming a judgment that determines whether or not you need an expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.887" offset="2486941">I respectfully submit that when you are dealing with a ladder, with an open hole, the lay juror has had enough experience with ladders and with openings that will drop 31 feet to be capable of forming its own judgment on whether that condition was safe or unsafe and whether there should have been a railing or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.962" offset="2571264">And it was not a subject that would require the tampering and the invasion of a juror's function by pitting experts against experts to delay the judicial process and confuse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.305" offset="2628629">The issue now turns to the second point on certiorari and that is future maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.142" offset="2663946">The trial judge by consent of the parties gave Salem three additional years --</text>

            <text syncTime="695.006" offset="2883375">It was contended that these lights which were going out all the time should have been anti vibration and different in the household bulb that they used.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.922" offset="2919111">And these are all items of safety devices which were not provided and were subjects of argument and presentation of proof in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.125" offset="2955891">Now throughout its brief, the respondent asks us, what other safety devices you are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.861" offset="2982849">And in our answering briefs, we keep telling them, a guideline or a lifeline, even a simple flashlight to see your way when you know foreseeably the lights inside this tower are no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.300" offset="3028616">Now, you would need this anti-skid paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.839" offset="3042722">We tell them that.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.810" offset="3046588">We argue that and I might say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.454" offset="3057142">The briefs of respondent, as I see them, represent re-arguments that -- of issues they presented to the jury in the same fashion which was rejected by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.876" offset="3102908">This is a Jones Act jury we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.344" offset="3112730">It has a function that this Court has held to be in violet for many, many, many decades of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.764" offset="3138435">Now to come here and say that because the man could have stretched his arms out and clothe these thin stiffeners and thereby held on an absolute darkness or that he gave a different version while under gross sedation on the ship as to what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.636" offset="3201964">These were all told to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.865" offset="3210846">They resolved the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.660" offset="3218056">They resolved the facts in favor of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.471" offset="3229236">I might also say that contentions of other errors were also considered by the majority and found in favor of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.411" offset="3257031">They found a contention of error with respect to negligent rescue, they found to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.437" offset="3273122">The obligation of the seaman to report and knowing dangerous condition, they filed for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.654" offset="3294020">So what remains is that the majority said here is a general verdict there was substantial evidence in favor of the plaintiff if the judge had posed special interrogatories because then, if the special interrogatory would have been answered by the jury, to state yes, there was negligence on the part of Richards, who left him there dangling in open space while confused and injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.983" offset="3383254">Oh, yes, if they found there was negligence occurred to provide adequate lights which kept going off, while then the verdict would have been sustained, I respectfully submit, neither party asked the special interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.750" offset="3430379">The judge, in his discretion, did not think special interrogatory should have been propounded, just as that his discretion he did nothing, an expert was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.715" offset="3462248">In light of this, if there's substantial evidence on some of the issues presented, then why suddenly out of the void, not even made part of the oral argument before the Court of Appeals, should this question of an expert be the basis of a reversal on a remand after seven days of trial and this is a second trial incidentally because the first one ended in mistrial.</text>

            <text syncTime="877.592" offset="3613759">We also moved for petition for rehearing en banc and the Court of Appeals then constituted of six judges were split three to three on whether there was need for an expert on such issues of obvious danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.720" offset="3666213">Accordingly, we have to come here because if we went back to the Court of Appeals and decided to proceed without an expert as we had before while maybe the majority would consist of the three who said we should have had one or vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.287" offset="3724518">So there is a need, of course, in the resolution of this issue not only for this case as I just indicated, but for all maritime cases to ascertain whether from now on, on all issues of maritime architecture, any simple issue of obvious danger that can be a trial with or without an expert and this Court in its past decisions on experts have shown how they can delay trial, how they're unnecessary on simple issues, how the lay mind can determine things of this nature and even where experts know more as long as the issue wasn't so complex and technical, it is still preferred not to have experts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1377.294" offset="5612544">I think we're all familiar with the type of crow's-nest which is exposed to the elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.314" offset="5632606">It's on the forward part of the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.746" offset="5642324">It's attached to the fore mast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.970" offset="5651205">There's a straight up and down ladder that leads to it and there's usually a basket light that lies at the top of it which is entered through a trap door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.966" offset="5691225">Now contrary to that on the United States, the lookouts could go to their lookout station without having to face the elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.178" offset="5740126">Now bear in mind that in the first type of ladder that I described, a seaman had to climb that in the dark because there's no lights allowed on forward (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.021" offset="5779414">There is a simple iron ladder with no platforms, no rest -- resting places where the seaman of the – of the – if there's a snow on the ladder or if rain is falling, your ship is rolling, he still must ascend that ladder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.922" offset="5855065">Now on the United States, all that danger was removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.087" offset="5875754">There was a ladder enclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.234" offset="5888293">The seaman was not affected by the weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.803" offset="5902608">If climbing up to three flights if you want to call it that or the separations, the first platform was about 11 feet off the deck and then the rest of them a little better than 5 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.470" offset="5957256">If he chose, he could step off there and rest instead of climbing the 30 somewhat feet which would bring him to his station.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.231" offset="6084315">Now I have to say however that I'm not very happy with the pictures because this is a very tight space.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.614" offset="6113782">It's only 46 inches at its widest part and its only 36 inches at its narrowest part and it's just about seven feet, fore and aft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.021" offset="6163414">So it was very difficult to take photographs but I have them and while I am on that subject I might mention that I had built an exact size mock up of this particular area of the crow's-nest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.425" offset="6237080">In other words, it's exactly the size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.091" offset="6243767">I have photographs of it here but they didn't get any evidence though nor did the mock up get into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.414" offset="6273024">In other words, what I wanted to show to the jury and I was forbidden from doing so by the court's ruling out this evidence, although on the prior trial, the judge had allowed it in, the jurors could have looked at this mock up tower and seen what the space was and seen what there was in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.885" offset="6370931">Now the contention is made here that in this vacuum in which the jury was acting, it could make a determination of whether or not there should have been some handrails and that's the only contention the plaintiff made, was handrails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.525" offset="6437491">The safety devices got into the case on the charge and that's one of the things to which I took objection because the very expression safety devices implies that there was something there – that there was something missing that would have made this man's journey safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.048" offset="6507604">Now let's talk about the lights and bulbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.706" offset="6522232">It's not part of this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.657" offset="6529964">We're not dealing with it here, but I have to refer to it only to point out that it's quite true that the light at this particular platform went out just prior to the accident but it had nothing whatever to do with this – with the plaintiff's fault and I'll explain that in a minute, but something was said here for example about heavy duty bulbs as compared to ordinary household bulbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.047" offset="6627558">Well, there was no evidence in the case whatsoever that any other type of bulbs would have been better than the bulbs which were being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.405" offset="6657024">This is a vessel that goes to sea, it's not a home and a bulb burn out as the testimony showed, but in any event, I suspect that the problem arises here because of a misconception by the Court of Appeals as to how it is that the plaintiff had his accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.956" offset="6739153">Now I think you might justify and may be infer from what the plaintiff's counsel said to you this morning that the plaintiff fell while he was stepping from this ladder in the dark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.341" offset="6784711">Well, that's not so at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.395" offset="6792965">Now the record on page -- in my brief rather, on pages 4 and 5 quote the testimony of exactly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.752" offset="6830373">The plaintiff testified that he had ascended this ladder and incidentally he had done it hundreds of times, he'd been doing his lookout work for over a year and he said he got up to the rung of the ladder from which he normally stepped off and his practice was to back off, take hold of a radar casing which was right at hand and then swing around and walk the necessary three steps to the crow's-nest, that's all it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.010" offset="6939460">It was no more than about three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.517" offset="6953462">So he – as he was taking his second foot off the ladder, this light went out and he then turned around and was facing towards the crow's-nest where he had to go and had taken one step forward away from the hole and he was about to take the second step when for reasons which do not appear in the record, he fell and he was found later on in this access hole to the ladder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.447" offset="7069132">Now I think that in the dissent by Judge Smith, he conceived that the accident happened as the plaintiff was stepping from the ladder onto the platform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.615" offset="7121795">Now, in that crow's-nest, at shoulder length, at shoulder height of the plaintiff anyway, there was a steel ledge that went around the inside and all that Mr. Salem had to do if he want to maintain his balance and he doesn't say he lost it, indeed, he said he never had any trouble with this area before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.849" offset="7210820">The other seaman who testified before him said that they never had any trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.029" offset="7227538">All he had to do was to extend his arms and he could have maintained himself and walk right to the crow's-nest where there was another man in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.442" offset="7265155">Now it's true it was dark but he should have known the area and the reason it was dark was because he, among other things, had failed to perform his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.290" offset="7304547">Now you were told here that they were -- an attempt was made to repair the electric wires, well that was not so at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.023" offset="7331506">There was a – there was a repair and it was effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.842" offset="7342791">What happened here were these lights burned out as bulbs do and the testimony is clear enough, but I should say that's not part of the case and I only mention it to indicate that -- or to reply to some of the things that was said to you this morning and I certainly don't like to trespass on my time to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.105" offset="7419800">But in any event, it was the plaintiff's duty as a lookout to report the absence of any lights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.700" offset="7450206">Now he says that when he started to work at midnight, two lights were out, the light was burning up at the level of the crow's-nest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.886" offset="7490957">He served two hours at lookout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.436" offset="7501093">He went down the ladder and the two lights were still out and no report from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.828" offset="7518647">He has a telephone right there in the crow's-nest, all he had to do was to telephone the bridge and the bridge would telephone the engine room, the engine room keeps on hand, an electrician whose job it is to replace lights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.221" offset="7592208">That's his – that's his function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.901" offset="7599000">So the plaintiff merely had to pick up his telephone and notify the bridge, there are some lights out and lights would have been furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.799" offset="7626585">But he didn't do it and then he violated his duty and I – we are charged that he was guilty of negligence because it maybe brought about his own accident, but now we get back to what's really an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.682" offset="7674128">Is it enough for the plaintiff to have some witness say in a particular area and that's unique, there was no handrail?</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.771" offset="7710490">Is it proper in the circumstances for the trial judge to add that and say safety devices?</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.963" offset="7739225">Now you've been told on -- by plaintiff's argument that we did not mentioned the matter of experts on the argument below and say we made some mention of it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.181" offset="7796067">Well that was really the important things of the brief and I don't think I did get to argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.638" offset="7813935">I was allowed 20 minutes to argue this case in the Court of Appeals and I just didn't get around to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.851" offset="7838804">I was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.212" offset="7844237">After I had only begun my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.891" offset="7854895">I think that in this case there were some 80 prejudicial ruling as against the defendant on the admission or rejection of evidence or remarks by the Court which were highly prejudicial to the defendant, those are some of the areas that we complained about and I only gotten through talking about them when the presiding judge said your time's up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.106" offset="7947786">Now it's also said by the plaintiff in this brief, in this court on page 25 --</text>

            <text syncTime="1992.952" offset="8075160">Now on page 111 of the record, as I was discussing before the charge was actually given, so many aspects of what the Court said he was to say, I said that I would take exemption to any issue of being submitted to the jury in respect of handrails or hand grips or lifelines in that radar tower because there has been no evidence or whatever that such handrails or lifelines are proper for such an area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.747" offset="8214340">It is a small enclosure where the widest part is four feet, the narrowest is three feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.722" offset="8234297">There was no expert that has been called here to testify that under such circumstances, in such a ship as this, there should be any such thing as handrails and lifelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.058" offset="8279646">So there isn't any question about the fact of the matter of the lack of expert evidence was right there in the trial all the time and I don't understand the statement made that we did -- it wasn't done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.431" offset="8329070">Now the Court of Appeals determined in accordance with two previous decisions of it that with respect to matters dealing with naval architecture, if a plan was made that the architecture of the vessel was wrong and defective, there had to be some proof of it and that the jury could not decide that matter for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.723" offset="8426245">There was some disparagement of experts here by plaintiff's counsel but he himself used experts and I don't think he may use the disparaged experts in general because they disagree with one another because that's what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.569" offset="8477654">He introduced two expert doctors, (Inaudible), both of them disagreed as to whether the plaintiff was injured or not, seriously and permanently injured I mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="2388.187" offset="9656090">It seems to me it's a matter of -- it's not a matter of architecture which is all we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.196" offset="9680123">Have in mind, if Your Honor please, that this case was set back for a new trial that the judges below in the Court of Appeals said there were numerous other areas which were charged by the defendant which they did not think necessary to notice because they were setting the case back for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.101" offset="9747728">And Judge Waterman, in his en banc decision said that after reviewing the record, he's ordered it to go back for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.944" offset="9779179">I'm not going to discuss those areas here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.979" offset="9787329">I don't have the time in the first place and the second place as I conceive it and the only – the only charge of error that's made in this Court and I think that we have a right to rely on that because I haven't done anything with these – these other charges, is that there should have been handrails in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.670" offset="9866010">Yes all there is in this case and this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.258" offset="9876355">Now it could very well be that a jury could say you ought to have some kind of a particular substance on a metal deck, lots of decks of ships have metals, and there is this access all you speak off, but the ship is full of such access holes, not only in the quarters where the seamen are and where they have to do their work but in the passengers accommodations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.250" offset="9976351">There are hundreds of such places.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.875" offset="9982830">You come up a stairway and there's no -- a door doesn't suddenly shut behind you so if you happen to lose your balance, you fall back in the stairway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.127" offset="10019924">There's any number of such stairways throughout the ship and it's not sought to be negligent because if you don't have the – the opening suddenly shut up so that if you lose your balance, you won't fall back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.607" offset="10065795">Now I think that -- of course I have to deal with this maintenance now and I'm not satisfied and I've completed my argument on this but as I say, I've got my time problems and I'm going to go over now to the maintenance aspect of this case and rely upon the matter stated as my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.980" offset="10167254">Now with respect to maintenance, as I said before, I don't think it's necessary to repeat the details, there was a very substantial disagreement among the plaintiff's doctors and the defendant's doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.311" offset="10224619">My doctor said that the plaintiff was able to go back to work and I have moving picture showing him doing all kinds of things which he said he couldn't do in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.846" offset="10254712">He crawled around in the courtroom and I have to walk him down the street like he was trying to do a mile, I had him jacking up an automobile and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.649" offset="10289925">So we had that dispute but that's one of the things that the trial judge should have determined which doctor am I going to believe, the plaintiff during the time between his actions and the trial had certified to the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Bureau that he was well and strong and not suffering from any condition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2582.225" offset="10432240">The only stipulation we made with respect to maintenance if it please the Court, is that the trial judge could determine the maintenance count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.648" offset="10469961">And we did agree that when the Court said I'm going to allow this maintenance to date, we figured out what that was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.853" offset="10498800">We have paid them a lot of money in maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.062" offset="10519594">Now if you make -- no, as a matter fact, I can test it that very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.422" offset="10537044">He gave him three years without any finding that he was entitled to three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.716" offset="10558255">Now we have to bear in mind that when we're talking about maintenance, when a seaman is disabled and unable to work or under treatment, it doesn't mean he gets maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.191" offset="10596185">First of, if he's in a hospital, he gets his maintenance there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.092" offset="10611754">So there would – should have a determination here by the trial judge if he was going to allow three years maintenance and there was no evidence to support it incidentally that he would have to take his treatment outside of the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.544" offset="10665566">If he took any of it inside of the hospital then he wasn't entitled to any maintenance with for the period of time which he was in the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.963" offset="10699212">Now under the rules of -- under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, when a trial judge determines an issue before him, he must make findings of facts and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.498" offset="10765354">The trial judge did not do that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.179" offset="10780087">He merely made a short statement that I think the poor man needs more treatment and I'm going to give it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.669" offset="10806000">There were some things said about him in getting rehabilitation treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.559" offset="10821569">Well the only evidence of that is that the one time he was to go to the hospital for rehabilitation treatment, he didn't show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.548" offset="10853543">Now, this Court has very wisely said in the Taylor-Calmar case and reiterated in the Farrell case and it doesn't -- it isn't a smart thing to give a seaman a lot of money in advance for their future medical treatment because they are said to be spend trips and you'd give him a huge sum of money like here $10,000 or so it is, he go out and spend it and when he needed a treatment, it wouldn't be there for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.241" offset="10988335">So the -- this Court had decided and I think in a well reasoned statement that what should be done is to give the man enough for the immediate future providing of course as evidence of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.294" offset="11032534">And then at the end of that period of time, if he needs more, he can come back and get more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.648" offset="11057925">And in this instance to say three years in advance and he's going to need treatment without any evidence to support it, the plaintiff had to qualify doctors neither of whom said he needed treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.615" offset="11117798">If Your Honors will notice the opinion, the Court of Appeals have pointed out what the evidence was with respect to this, that there was plenty of a doubt as to whether or not he needed the treatment on the plaintiff's own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.870" offset="11206823">One of the plaintiff's doctors indicated that perhaps he would become permanently disabled where no cure could be of any help to him if he ever gets to that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.926" offset="11259068">That's another time when maintenance ceases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.669" offset="11270040">Actually, I don't think this Court has ever made a determination as how far in the future, maintenance should go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.452" offset="11309223">Back in the -- in the early case, the first case where there was a determination of it, in the Calmar-Taylor case, it was then – it had to be decided whether or not maintenance right – the seaman's right to maintenance extended beyond the end of the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.783" offset="11390516">That's what the state of the law was then and the Second Circuit made a decision not at all to go beyond that in connection with harbor worker and when the case came down here, this Court made an examination of what the law was after that time and determined that seamen should get maintenance beyond the end of the voyage and that it should extend through reasonable time but not beyond that time and further more that no large amounts like seven years which was allowed in that case should be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.519" offset="11529488">Now that's the only case I know of which has ever come to this Court where anytime has ever been fixed for the length of maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.222" offset="11564283">And it's a burden which is imposed upon the shipowner along with all the other burdens that has to face now and I don't think it ought to be likely treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.878" offset="11598869">Today, a seaman has a right to indemnity even though he doesn't prove any negligence under the unseaworthiness theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.867" offset="11630843">The doctrine of negligence is to the point now where there is some negligence then he's entitled to recover damages even though it's not the specific cause of its injury as long as somebody could say it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.830" offset="11694686">So I say we're at the point now where I think maintenance ought to be very carefully considered and that these outright grants of three years of maintenance ought not to be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.752" offset="11734392">I wanted to say one other thing and I'm going to suspend. Something was said here about the court that are being other evidence of negligence which a jury could have attached its finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.060" offset="11787577">Well that's very true, but their law is true that where there are a number of charges of negligence, one of two of which may not support a verdict and the whole thing has to go back and be tried again and that's what happened here and there's adequate law to sustain that feature of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.648" offset="11861974">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.164" offset="11868035">To respond directly, Your Honors, to the last point, of course if there's anything seriously erroneous about an instruction although there was other evidence to support the verdict, it should go back, but the error contended here is one related to railing or other safety devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.344" offset="11944730">This was clear from the record and the testimony of defendant's own witnesses as well as ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.174" offset="11964061">If it was wrong to pose this even, I would say that's on the Harmless Error of Rule 61, it could not be considered germane or be pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.979" offset="12003244">The major issue as I see it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.208" offset="12016201">Does the requirement of a rope, the requirement of a rail, around an open hole of such a complex and technical nature that only an expert could testify on it that is the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.812" offset="12066670">And if a jury is told that they must have an expert to dilute their Jones Act function in such a simple issue, it will be on every other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.790" offset="12098539">You will have protracted trials, you will have your delays, you'll have your experts pitted against experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.351" offset="12116825">There's a very real danger in this particular determination by the Court of Appeals downstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.717" offset="12142216">And as I told the Court at the beginning, there is a disjunctive reasoning here as to why the reversal was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.608" offset="12173772">The first thing, the feasibility of construction, of course, there is no question of a line being part of a construction item, but the feasibility of construction and the need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.454" offset="12217240">Well, we had the testimony by long experience seamen, Trible and Terry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.047" offset="12239600">Trible himself had a second mate's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.413" offset="12249004">They are part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.117" offset="12255796">For example, this is what was stated by the first witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.987" offset="12283277">I think his name was Trible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.056" offset="12287561">He says, no, this rectangular pipe that we spoke about where the radar cable ran through and which is marked in plaintiff Exhibit 2 for identification, did you ever use that as a hand hold, that being the only one available?</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.778" offset="12670516">Answer, No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.188" offset="12332074">Did you ever grab it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.037" offset="12335522">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.799" offset="12338552">Why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.661" offset="12342000">Well, because I don't ever grab hold of anything that has electrical current going through plus the fact that it was too big to grab hold of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.334" offset="12368750">And then the other witness, Terry, who had 88 times for each voyage going up and down this ladder who have been on a 160 or 188 voyages on the vessel who knew this particular vessel better than any one else who could possibly be called from the outside and he said, “Question, the crow's-nest platform, was there a railing to grab a hold of?</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.183" offset="12444087">Answer, The platform level when you go in the crow's-nest question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.977" offset="12455267">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.613" offset="12457775">Answer, There is no special railing there, regular construction of the crow's-nest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.717" offset="12474284">Question, What is a lifeline?</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.814" offset="12482644">Answer, Safety measure, to grab hold on to protect yourself until you are safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.703" offset="12502183">Question, were there any lifelines at this platform level when you left the crow's-nest on February 15, 1958?</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.571" offset="12529664">And with respect to the chief judge's request about the platform itself on page 159, Richards, he being the relief man who left the plaintiff fit on this ledge to fall again, Question, The platform itself on which the accident happened, what was its condition on a daily accident?</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.242" offset="12604374">Answer, What are you – what are you referring to by condition?</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.053" offset="12615555">Question, Were there any rising, any preparations, any diamonds to catch or put to protect it from slipping?</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.267" offset="12640423">Answer, It is a steel plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.900" offset="12647006">There are no preparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.367" offset="12652857">It is smooth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.718" offset="12658291">Question, Was there any skid proof paint or anything like that on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.200" offset="12676159">And Mr. Connor wants you to say that because for eight years there was no accident on this particular platform, therefore, you should deem it safe but for eight years, the light didn't go out simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.379" offset="12712939">I believe this man in complete pitched darkness and he says he should have raised his arms so he could have held onto the sides, but the testimony is clear that he didn't have time yet to raise his hands and besides he was scared, he was scared right there and he slipped on this one smooth platform and fell backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.499" offset="12785351">He had nothing to guide him in pitch-darkness from this ladder to the point where he fell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.595" offset="12805726">True, he didn't fall until he got both feet on the platform, but he started from that ladder when the lights all went out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.877" offset="12834879">And when Mr. Connor talks of one light, I wish Your Honors to remember, there were five lights in that tower, five lights were out at the time.</text>
