            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">I find on a review of yesterday's proceedings that the points that I had intended to return to this morning have been enlarged part -- anticipated by corrections from the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.126" offset="163924">And I shall -- consequently this morning simply identify for you the places in our reply brief where the material is found which I referred yesterday, invite your attention to it and reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal unless there are questions this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.746" offset="254307">The reply brief was follow -- was filed October 2, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.943" offset="287117">The limitation issue is found beginning at Page 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.873" offset="330898">It is captioned, “The legislative history of the Project Act does not support severance of the Colorado River Compact from the California Limitation Agreement”.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.351" offset="364753">The priority issue is covered beginning at Page 34 and it is captioned, “The priorities of California's established projects up to 4,400,000 acre-feet annually should be protected from impairment by new projects in Arizona and Nevada”.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.667" offset="434030">The water supply or justiciability issue is covered beginning at Page 98.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.894" offset="462973">And if this caption -- if the conclusion is reached by the Special Master as urged by the other parties are correct, this controversy is not justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.315" offset="500590">It goes on to say, however, that upon our premises, this controversy is justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.941" offset="523160">And may I invite your attention also to the preliminary material which begins at Page 1 which is captioned, “The basic controversy”.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.246" offset="568404">And here, we attempt to sum up the impact of these three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.095" offset="587734">The limitation or severance issue, as we sometimes call it, the priority issue and the jurisdictional water supply issue as compared with California's claims and the impact, the effect of the Colorado River Compact.</text>

          <turn speaker="mark_wilmer" startTime="173.201" stopTime="878.097">
            <label>Mr. Mark Wilmer</label>
            <text syncTime="173.201" offset="796191">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.473" offset="809253">Arizona's case brief itself naturally into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.224" offset="828270">The first being the controversy between the states over the Colorado River, the interstate controversy mainly Arizona versus California in that we are supported largely in the Master's -- in upholding the Master's Report by United States and by Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.773" offset="906428">The second portion of the controversy which is really almost a separate controversy involves the dispute between Arizona mainly and the United States with respect to the claims of the United States for federal establishments mainly the reservations on the Colorado River, the Indian Reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.436" offset="989080">Because of that of the fact that in one sense we are appellee here insofar as California is concerned and that we mainly support the Master's Report, we have yielded to California our plaintiff's position to open.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.876" offset="1046862">However, with respect to the United States in effect, we are the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.908" offset="1067029">And therefore, with the Court's permission, we propose to divide our argument as I've indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.916" offset="1095032">I will discuss the Arizona position and the reasons why we believe the Master's Report fundamentally is sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.724" offset="1130245">And Mr. Reed, in turn, will discuss with you Arizona's views with respect to the apportionment made to the federal establishments and particularly, the Indian Reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.743" offset="1178311">I expect to use approximately four hours of our allotted time and Mr. Reed approximately an hour and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.554" offset="1217599">Please the Court, some 36 years ago, Justice Holmes in an opinion written for this Court in Sanitary District of Chicago versus the United States could very well have been using language which we think appropriate to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.700" offset="1294190">He first discussed the great issues involved, the claims of the Sanitary District of Chicago as to the vast amounts of money which had been expended.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.155" offset="1339956">He then turned to their claims of the great importance for many billions of people residing in the Chicago area.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.633" offset="1373915">He then said after having summarized the issues as presented by the pleadings, this brief summary of the pleadings shows the importance and gravity of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.388" offset="1428877">But importance and gravity alone do not tend to impede the ability to decide the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.113" offset="1475793">The exact language were, do not stand in the way of a quick decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.943" offset="1503169">He then said the mere fact that great sums were involved and that the millions -- the welfare of millions of people is involved does not do more than ten to cause disputes which would less mighty interests involved, no one would venture to question.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.926" offset="1595120">He round up with this significant phrase dealing there with navigable water as we are dealing with navigable water here, “The law is clear and when it is known, the material facts are few”.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.053" offset="1659591">And we say here dealing again with a navigable stream that the law is clear and when it is known, the material facts are indeed few.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.117" offset="1703790">This great record undoubtedly will serve as a repository of many interesting studies, of many interesting excursions into the field of hydrology, into the field of many things but from the stand point of relevancy to this case, it is our belief that ninety percent of the record is in the same category as was characterized by Justice Holmes in the Sanitary District in Chicago case.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.585" offset="1821759">Either this case is one -- if it please the Court, in which to take it by a mighty phrase which Senator King used in the project debates, the United States has put its mighty hands down upon the river and has you surfed its flow has laid aside all other lesser interests except in supplier as to that they indicated a contrary purpose, either that or else despite the fact that under the navigations of under the par which the Congress has under the Commerce Clause when they can call of a navigable river.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.157" offset="1975986">It has expended these great sums to store the entire flow of the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.586" offset="2001690">It has expended these great sums in building that works that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.500" offset="2021334">And this Court has said it has done so constitutionally under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.263" offset="2048397">Either that, as we have said or else as California would request this Court that river still flows as it was want to flow, the river is still a course as its old course down the Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.844" offset="2114748">We say, if it please the Court that the law is clear and that the material facts are few.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.694" offset="2146200">Significantly, if it please the Court, despite the fact that the Special Master relied strongly upon the Chandler Dunbar case decided in 1913, upon the appellates in Electric case decided later, upon the Twin City Power case but despite those cases which the Master relied upon and which Arizona and the United States relied upon as ruling this case, California has not even cited those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.795" offset="2278588">We suspect that perhaps the reason is that it's impossible to cite them, to read them and not to find the answer to this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.548" offset="2337520">I do not need -- if it please the Court to -- I might add to that the early case of United States versus Rio Grande Irrigation and Dam Company in 174 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.352" offset="2384750">The Court will recall that that was a case in which this Court examined the power of Congress unto the navigation of the Commerce Clause and in the light of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1890 and 1899, in that case, 1890 because the 1999 Act had not been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.934" offset="2471058">And in that case, this Court held that with respect to a navigable river, anything which impaired its navigable capacity violated the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1890 and in that case, sent it back to the District Court in New Mexico, the Federal District Court, to ascertain if in fact the proposed construction of this dam would impair the navigable capacity of the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.470" offset="2601253">The Court in that case said that Congress under the Commerce Clause had the right not only to demand no obstructions to the flow of a navigable stream itself but had the right to reach up into a tributaries if interference on the tributaries impair the navigable capacity of the stream below.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.771" offset="2690487">I make that point because I think it will become quite important later in our discussion with respect to the so-called truncation of the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.223" offset="2740224">It is our position briefly, if it please the Court that the position of the Upper Basin in this case is of no more consequence than the rights of Massachusetts or New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.566" offset="2789648">This case is solely a case of statutory construction of the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.023" offset="2815457">This case no more involves the rights of the Upper Basin than it involves the rights of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.731" offset="2846281">Congress in enacting the Project Act, in our review, if it may please the Court, spoke under its dominant servitude which this Court has called “a power over navigable water”, a dominant power not in terms of property but in terms of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.122" offset="2915871">In the Project Act, the Congress of the United States, exercising the power which resides in it by a virtue of the Constitution has put the river water in its pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.610" offset="2977834">It has bonded up in Lake Mead and it is then said how this water is to be distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.894" offset="3010957">I don't care, if it please the Court whether Congress talked about 3 (a) or 3 (b) or 3 (c), the decisive question before this Court is, ”What water did Congress have in mind?”</text>
            <text syncTime="741.542" offset="3069576">Whatever terms it may have employed become wholly immaterial if it is clear what water it was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.554" offset="3105625">I say again, if it please the Court that if it is clear from the legislative history, from the surroundings which existed at that time that Congress was talking about mainstream water which it was going to store at Lake Mead and which it was going to direct the apportionment of then the terminology used to tell us what it intended becomes relatively important.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.230" offset="3200293">The Master has said that the Congressional reference to 3 (a) of the Project Act related to a fourth hand method of describing the first 7,500,000 acres available for consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.533" offset="3261524">Arizona has disagreed to one extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.784" offset="3278555">We fully agree with the Master that what the Congress was talking about was at first 7,500,000 available for consumptive use in the Lower Basin each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.664" offset="3330069">The Master has said that 3 (a) constitutes an appropriative ceiling against the Upper Basin and necessarily if it's a appropriative ceiling against the Upper Basin, it has to be with respect to the mainstream because you don't get an appropriative right against the source of water that you don't have access to.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.428" offset="3413034">So our tributaries have no access to the Upper Basin, therefore, it's a short junk in the Master's position to our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.344" offset="3444799">But I do not propose, if it please the Court, to pursue at length any attempt of interpretation of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.963" offset="3479176">The Master, at the outset turned to the Delphic instrument and he said, “Each time you shake the kaleidoscope, you get a different picture”.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.355" offset="3508746">I think that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.304" offset="3516583">But because it is irrelevant, because the Master has held it irrelevant and because we agree, we do not propose to pursue an interpretation of it because it would serve no purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.990" offset="3563290">It's nice to debate how many angels can dance in a point of a pin but unless it becomes of some consequence in the lawsuit, best be laid aside at least in the Court of this dignity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark Wilmer</label>
            <text syncTime="1159.928" offset="4743084">That it means the first 7,500,000 acre-feet of water released or available rather in the Lower Basin, the rest is academic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.594" offset="4777775">If the Upper Basin were here, perhaps we might debate the matter but they're not here and they're not necessarily here because in the Hinderlider Case, this Court construed the Compact which involved four states with only two present because only two states' rights were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.915" offset="4843081">And here, the impact of this decision cannot reach to the Upper Basin because we're not construing the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.423" offset="4873070">We're construing a statute passed in 1929 which has reference only to a supply coming down from the Upper Basin in which does not pretend to reach into the Upper Basin and ask or demand any water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.554" offset="4937540">In fact, if it please the Court, counsel yesterday talked of Section 18 of the Project Act which you will recall, in substance provides that, ”No local waters, no local rights shall be invaded, shall be impaired or otherwise affected by the Project Act”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.783" offset="5042552">The exact language, “Nothing herein shall be construed as interfering with such rights the states now have either their water within their borders or to adopt such policies in the next such laws that they may deem necessary with respect to the appropriation control and use of waters within their borders except -- except as modified by the Colorado River Compact or other Interstate Agreement”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.324" offset="5152684">The contention which California makes is perhaps plausible but when this Project Act is read in the light of its legislative history and of the conditions then persisting -- then existing, when we read in this Project Act the great care, the actual overemphasis upon protection that the Upper Basin demand, we understand what this means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.758" offset="5262399">The Court will recall the Master said that the peers of the Upper Basin were against the quick development of the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.390" offset="5304926">Wyoming versus Colorado had been decided in 1922 and from that point forward, the peers of the Upper Basin increased because of the recognition of the doctrine of prior appropriation in an equitable -- equitable apportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.744" offset="5358320">This language in substance says what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.843" offset="5370755">It says that the rights of the Upper Basin are preserved and are not affected by this Act with one exception as modified by Colorado River Compact -- as modified by the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.137" offset="5423940">We say, if it please the Court, that Section 18 is a barrier which the Upper State erected as between the Upper and the Lower Basin States to be sure nothing pass through that barrier by virtue of the Project Act except the burden they assume under the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.617" offset="5509831">So I say again, if it please the Court, that the rights of the Upper Basin are not involved and cannot be involved because they're not affected by the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.744" offset="5546297">And the Project Act stands, if it please the Court, as the sole instrument before this Court for interpretation as the rights of the states because Congress did bottle up on that water, Congress did put the hand -- mighty hands of the United States down upon that stream and it did take it into its custody and did apportion it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.429" offset="5637099">If I might, digressing for a moment, please the Court, I think it might be helpful because we have not have the advantage of it at this point to just briefly review the geography of the area and some of the background which existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.561" offset="5705644">Again, if I might use the words of a great jurist Learned Hand, he said that where'd you like chameleons which take their color from their environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.144" offset="5751933">And I think we need to know the environment that existed when the Project Act was passed to understand the full impact of the words which are contained in the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.451" offset="5809194">Briefly and I'm sure the Court has perhaps read this many times, the Colorado River is -- as the Master said the stream of continental proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.004" offset="5851408">It is the third largest in the United States surpassed only by the Rio Grande and the Mississippi that extends approximately 1300 miles generally as you saw in the map yesterday in the northerly and the southerly direction rising in the high peaks of Colorado some 14,000 feet high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.950" offset="5931133">It extends to Colorado 245 miles, to Utah 285 miles to Arizona alone 295 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.903" offset="5975019">It is the common border of Arizona and Nevada 445 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.746" offset="5994350">It is a common border of Arizona and California for 235 miles and it is a common border of Arizona and the Republic of Mexico from 16 to 20 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.210" offset="6048162">So immediately, it becomes apparent the great State of Arizona has in this river because as far as access, as far as it being a part of Arizona, Arizona's contact with it outweighs down of all other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.880" offset="6126843">Master further found in the tables are in the report and I will briefly cover them to the save taking it up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.925" offset="6203120">And Arizona's total of 113,900 miles, 107,242 fly within the drainage basin of the Colorado River System.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.974" offset="6255261">California has 3,599 miles within the drainage basin of the Colorado River System.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.058" offset="6291623">The percentage of the total state in the drainage basin, Arizona is 94 and one tenths percent, California 2 and three tenths percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.106" offset="6391829">The square miles of the State in the Lower Basin of Arizona 100,306 California, 3599.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.669" offset="6438013">The percent of the State in the Lower Basin that is of the entire State is 88 and five tenths percent against California, two and three and tenths percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.566" offset="6473644">Now, it is true, if it please the Court, that in the past, Arizona has been charged with being rather unreasonable with respect to this river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.787" offset="6510529">And yet I think this figure should bring home to its very quick to the fact that Arizona has to be a little unreasonable because this is a sole treasure Arizona has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.369" offset="6560893">This is the sole practically access Arizona has to life getting water because if you can see, practically the entire State, future is wrapped up in the Colorado River and therefore, when your very life perhaps as a State, we just be justified perhaps being just a little unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.198" offset="6660159">If I might pursue that matter just a little further, the Upper Basin is noted for the fact that it is at very high altitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.261" offset="6692446">It has a short growing season of three to four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.862" offset="6706866">Most of its irrigable areas are narrow valleys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.588" offset="6729749">The access to irrigation water is difficult, costly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.085" offset="6755662">On the contrary in the Lower Basin, it has a growing season almost the year around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.502" offset="6777396">It has broad large expanses of level land rather usually available for irrigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.716" offset="6810206">So far as community of interest is concerned, the two Basins are separated by a thousand mile canyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.714" offset="6850226">Actually, the picture which shown -- the map which you show on the easel yesterday correctly depicts the square miles of the two Basins but actually they should be viewed in a shape of a -- of an hourglass, perhaps, not in the exact -- it's a little bit of a crooked hourglass but you have in the Upper Basin a basin which is in itself a (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.962" offset="6983241">You have a thousand miles of arid, canyon, difficult country where the river flows in the canyons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.300" offset="7020544">You have the Lower Basin or you have the level land and the long growing seasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.099" offset="7047816">I say this -- I bring this to your attention for mainly this reason, there is absolutely no community of interest between the two basins other than their common interest in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.414" offset="7097031">And I might say perhaps the fact that there was a religious interest in the Mormon Church, the good people of Utah and the good Mormons of our State of course had a strong religious community of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.861" offset="7162859">But communication is practically non-existent in the century nor today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.848" offset="7178742">New York and Chicago was more accessible to Arizona than Denver at those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.289" offset="7200580">So that these things are important when we come to consider what Congress was talking about when it enacted the Project Act because actually, the low Upper Basin had no more interest in the Lower Basin than it had in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.469" offset="7277275">There was simply nothing there other than the one common treasure that they both sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.235" offset="7296293">They both desired access to and wanted to get as much of as they could and that was the Colorado River as it extended from the Upper Basin and to Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.843" offset="7338715">When further fact, may I brought your attention of the Lower Basin tributaries, the only one of consequence, of real consequence is the Gila, which empties into the Colorado River above the City of Yuma and some 20 miles or so above the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.394" offset="7416978">In the early days, the Mexican, the imperial liberation was to (Inaudible) which came out of Arizona about four miles above Mexico when down into Mexico followed a course to Mexico to above Calexico is now and there reentered California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.422" offset="7497017">So that from the standpoint of the Upper Basin, it had no interest whatever in the Lower Basin tributaries, it couldn't get to them, they weren't accessible to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.524" offset="7537455">They simply used a hydrological fact that water doesn't run uphill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.576" offset="7553651">So that the only fund of water which was available for consideration and division among both basins was the mainstream as it flowed down from the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.503" offset="7613419">It would be assuming that the Upper Basin desired to impose upon the Lower Basin an economic ceiling to say it was concerned with how much water was used in the Lower Basin for consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.459" offset="7661171">The Upper Basin was concerned with one thing, that thing was how much water have we got to give them down below under threat of court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.124" offset="7699832">The Lower Basin was concerned with just one thing, how much can we shake out of it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.676" offset="8362088">The same consideration, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, withheld Arizona's ratification of the Compact has caused the Upper Basin to refuse to pass the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.335" offset="8400750">I think that's a fair statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.452" offset="8413184">Now, as I've indicated, it is Arizona's position and it is Master's position in which we will highly concur that this is the statutory construction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.639" offset="8465951">This is a case which involves the construction of the project -- Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.244" offset="8492387">It is true, after the Master found the Compact had no relevance, after he had said that it is to be laid aside and has no consequence in this case because it is what Congress meant when it passed the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.487" offset="8549334">He then said however, in view of the fact that the Court may not agree with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.085" offset="8579741">On the chance that the Court might decide to construe the Compact, I will express my views as to what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.774" offset="8610461">And he then went on to several pages using language which is in effect as California has told you except that he did limit his holding as to 3 (a) that it was an inappropriative ceiling as against the Upper Basin which is a far cry from –- an appropriative ceiling in the entire basins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.308" offset="8700635">The Court will look in his -- the Master's Report in page 114, I believe it is , you'll see that he twice holds that it is a ceiling in the Lower Basin only as against the appropriators in the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.911" offset="8763016">In other words, he construed the Compact fairly and squarely as an interbasin instrument and he said this 3 (a) is a ceiling against rights in the Lower Basin against the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.490" offset="8813380">And since the only water in the Lower Basin in which rights could be obtained against the Upper Basin would be mainstream water necessarily we have reference from mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.345" offset="8864789">Now I take it there's no point in going into a discussion of appropriative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.894" offset="8886941">We all know that to get an appropriative right, you must get it again to someone else, an appropriative in the vacuum does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.851" offset="8922781">It is of importance only because it gives you precedence over someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.450" offset="8941171">And that precedence of necessity must be against someone else who has access to that water, otherwise, it would have no meaning it'd be a little medal you pin on your chest and say I've got an appropriative right but so what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.377" offset="8988923">So that as I said earlier, it's a short junk from Arizona's contention actually in practical effect to the Master's conclusion because he did say that the 3 (a) is a limitation as against the Upper Basin only in gaining appropriative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.979" offset="9063320">He then went on and discussed it at some length and used general language but he's holding is as I have told the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.520" offset="9101458">This Court -- if it please the Court in the Chandler-Dunbar case if you recall was considering the question of excess capacity over navigation in the Saint Mary's River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.935" offset="9147120">The Chandler-Dunbar Company there was seeking compensation for loss of power rights on the basis that there was excess capacity in the river above the requirements of navigation and therefore, they should have compensation that having been taken by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.585" offset="9221726">This Court said in that case, in substance, there is no room for judicial review of the determination of Congress as to whether this water should be taken, there is no room for review as to whether or not the excess water, there is excess water and if so, should there be compensation?</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.501" offset="9317334">It's squarely held that it was a legislative determination by the Congress and that it was not the function of this Court to review the discretion of Congress in the exercise of its powers under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.840" offset="9394761">Now, that holding has been cited many, many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.834" offset="9414719">This Court in the appellates in case used the language, “In truth, the authority of the United States and the regulation of Commerce on its waters' navigability in a sense just stated, is but a part of the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.044" offset="9491519">Flood protection, watershed development, recovery of the cost of improvements to utilization of power are likewise parts of Commerce control”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.766" offset="9538435">I would like if I might, to repeat again that last statement, recovery of the cost of improvements to utilization of power are likewise parts of Commerce control because I think that will bear quite heavily upon our friends in California's criticism of the Master's truncation of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.035" offset="9627564">It will bear quite heavily upon the notion of whether or not Arizona or California for that matter, could go above the river and stick a pipe down in its supply in the mainstream which has been dedicated by Congress to the provision of water pump in the Project Act and thereby take out a substantial flow of water from that river because -- I would come to this in a moment, the Project Act requires the Secretary before entering into the project, before beginning construction, that he shall make a determination if the revenues from the project shall be sufficient to repay its cost of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.752" offset="9802376">So that anyone who for and moment would stand here and tell this Court that despite the fact that the Congress plainly in the debates looked to the supply at Lee Ferry as a supply of water plainly told the Secretary, "Before you construct this project, you shall see you have revenues sufficient to repay it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.519" offset="9877400">But nonetheless and despite that, Arizona, California or anyone else could interfere with the water supply of that project as it comes in Lee Ferry and dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.988" offset="9919300">Despite or in addition of course, you have Rivers and Harbors Act, you have the requirements that you obtain a permit from Congress and of course, you have to have the Congressional approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.724" offset="9962245">I merely say that the language of the case I just cited, the Appelachian Electric case plainly indicates, plainly indicates that as a part of the Commerce Clause Power, that the powers of Congress go far beyond just the matter of regulating the flow of the river but extends through all these peripheral -- peripheral things which go to aid the exercise of this power by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2575.986" offset="10407267">That clause speaks in terms of power, not of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.283" offset="10424508">But the power is a dominant one which can be asserted to the exclusion of any competing or conflicting one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.249" offset="10448332">The power is a privilege which we have called a dominant servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.538" offset="10465573">The legislative history in the construction of particular enactments may lead to the conclusion that Congress exercise less than its Constitutional power, fell short of appropriating the flow of the river to the public domain and provided that private rights existing under state law should be compensable or otherwise, recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.800" offset="10546552">Such with United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Company, Federal Power Commission v. Niagara Power Company suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.976" offset="10579257">I might say in passing, California did cite the Gerlach case only to misconstrue it and to state that held something which it goes -- it does come -- have no place for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.272" offset="10628472">They said it recognized and established appropriative rights, it did no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.164" offset="10644041">It recognized that Congress could, in enacting a statute, provide for compensation that it could exercise less than the whole of its power if it desire.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.399" offset="13148975">Section 1, the first portion of it, after the enacting clause, provides that for the purpose of controlling floods and this is found in either in the Master's Report Appendix 2, I believe Your Honors or the Arizona's opening brief, Appendix B page 9A, “That for the purpose of controlling floods, improving navigation and regulating the flow of the Colorado River, providing for storage and for the delivery of the stored water thereof for reclamation of public lands and other beneficial uses exclusively within the United States, for the generation of electrical energy as means of making the project herein authorize a self-supporting and financially solvent undertaking, the Secretary of the Interior, subject to the terms of the Colorado River Compact hereafter mentioned is hereby authorized to construct, operate and maintain a dam and related works in the mainstream of the Colorado River at Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon, adequate to create a storage reservoir of the capacity of not less than 20,000,000 acre-feet of water”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.131" offset="13443845">Now may I say this at this point (Inaudible), the United -- the California has severely criticized the Master for saying that the Secretary of the Interior had no power beyond the reservoir and the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.279" offset="13512495">That's all the Congress gave him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.238" offset="13524302">They said the Secretary might construct a dam and create a reservoir above it but capacity of not less than 20,000,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.966" offset="13563277">So that's where the Project Act ends so far as the Secretary is concerned as of the top end of that reservoir because there is where Congress ended his authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="4217.585" offset="16973720">Well, I -- I said that isn't the right thing Senator Johnson said there, the likelihood of wherever being any question shortage is remote, it really isn't something that we need to get too excited about, although I would have at this point in passing correct Mr. Ely when he said that the Master's shortage apportionment cut across established rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.162" offset="17072044">The report expressly provides that in the event of shortages, present perfected rights are fully paid, are fully taken care of and then the shortage is apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.665" offset="17114049">I'm sure Mr. Ely spoke as it at least as we read the Master's report his holding squarely was an untimely shortage present perfected rights take precedence and thereafter the -- the water -- (Inaudible) water is shared (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.177" offset="17192103">Now I want to just -- again refrain to Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.167" offset="17212061">The Secretary of the Interior -- I'm skipping to the second paragraph, shall prescribe and enforce rules and regulations with the -- conforming with the requirements of the Federal Power Act as far as after who, respecting the maintenance of work, conditions of repair adequate to their efficient operation, maintenance of system, accounting control rates and so on relating only to power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.829" offset="17306728">He then -- then further provides he shall also conform with other provision, the Federal Water Power Act and the rules and regulations of the Federal Power Commission which have been devised or which may have to be devised for the protection of the investor and consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.245" offset="17360332">The point I am making and reading this is only this Your Honor that when we come to a considerate -- Your Honors, when we come to a consideration of Arizona's position that 4 (a) and 5 of the Project Act constituted a mandatory formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.361" offset="17428773">It becomes most significant to find in the Project Act detailed treatment -- detailed treatment of how power shall be handled, detailed treatment of who shall get it, what policy shall govern and if there'd be conflicted applicants, they shall have a hearing and yet in the disposition of this most precious commodity water, we find only the language that the Secretary shall conform with the provisions of Article 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.060" offset="17555623">I want then to go if I may, to Section 4 (a) and Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.169" offset="17588015">They're long, I am not going to read them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.318" offset="17600658">I'm simply going to note two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.302" offset="17616541">The first paragraph of Section 4 (a), as it was finally passed, provided for either a six or a seven-state ratification within six months or a six-state ratification within or within six -- I'm sorry, provided for a seven-state ratification or if that did not occur within six months, then for a six-state ratification; provided further, that as we read it and as the Master found in any event, the Project Act shall not take effect until California shall have, for the benefit of the United States and for the benefit of the other Basin States, enacted the Limitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.965" offset="17791248">It further provided in paragraph 2 for what is termed the permissive compact, it simply provides that in paragraph 2, unnumbered of 4 (a), that the three states were authorized to enter into a compact dividing the 7,500,000 in accordance with the way it was divided in 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.232" offset="17892289">At least with respect to the fact that in 4 (a), it said California can't take more than 4,400,000 that therefore there was a 2,800,000 and 300,000 left for Arizona and Nevada, provided for certain other things which I am not going to discuss here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.778" offset="17958536">Then provided in (b) that before any money is appropriated for the construction of said dam or power plant or any construction work done or contracted for, the Secretary of the Interior must make provision for revenues sufficient to ensure repayment of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.537" offset="18029484">Then in Section 5 as present as an Act, it provide that he was authorized, the Secretary, under such general regulations as he might prescribe to contract for the storage of water and its delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.829" offset="18086640">Then, if it please the Court, this language will become significant and will be heard again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.611" offset="18117778">Contracts respecting water for irrigation and domestic uses shall be for permanent service and shall conform to paragraph (a) of Section 4 of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.377" offset="18164903">No person shall have or be entitled to have the use for any purpose of the water stored as aforesaid, except by contract made as herein stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.604" offset="18217775">The Master has held and Arizona agrees that Congress intended by this provision to prohibit the use of any water stored pursuant to these works, other than by contract; but that was the intent of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.251" offset="18284335">Now if I might, I would like to, in reviewing the legislative history of this matter, first turn to the Governor's Conference of 1927 that is found in the last page of the Arizona legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.372" offset="18360822">It is printed in various other places but if you will turn to the last two pages 158 and 159, the recommending -- the recommendations of the Governor's Conference are set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.886" offset="18422888">I would call Your Honors' attention to the fact that up to this point in 1927, the Swing-Johnson Acts have been appointed and rejected in the Congress and at Denver in 1927, in September and first part of October, the seven Governors of the seven Basin States met at Denver in a conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.168" offset="18516093">It is apparent it was quite a conference because we will see later Senator Pittman was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.171" offset="18536051">We know that Delph Carpenter was there from his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.936" offset="18551097">We know that Senators Phipps was there from his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.233" offset="18572309">Therefore, we can assume, I think, without stretching the record that it was quite a conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.065" offset="18603656">It was attended by all of the prominent water people of the seven Basin States involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.730" offset="18630301">Its purpose, to try to work out this conflict between Arizona and California, to try to work out some kind of a meeting of the minds so to speak, whereby Arizona would ratify the Compact and the Project Act could be enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.563" offset="18701667">It is significant, if it please the Court, that one of the Governors attending this conference was Governor Emerson, Frank Emerson, who had been one of the Compact negotiators for the State of Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.421" offset="18761017">It is significant that from his testimony, Delph Carpenter, another of the negotiators of the Commissions of the Compact was in attendance of this conference because from his testimony in the Congressional hearings, we know he was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.172" offset="18824025">Now, I say in passing that we have here the people concerned who are most vitally affected, the Upper Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.045" offset="18875538">Finally, the four Governors of the Upper Division States New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado sat as arbitrators -- sat as arbitrators to determine what should be the division made to the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.600" offset="18945755">I have mentioned the names of the arbitrators because it seems to me that they, particularly Carpenter and Emerson must have been keenly aware of the exact obligation of the Upper Basin under the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.688" offset="19010121">The Governors there recommended of the average annual delivery of water to be provided by the States of the Upper Division at Lee's Ferry under the terms of the Colorado River Compact, 300,000 to Nevada, 3,000,000 to Arizona, 4,000,000 to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.122" offset="19091832">Secondly, that Arizona should have the unequivocal use of a million acre-feet, the Colorado River Tributaries employing in the State with reference to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.921" offset="19135091">Significantly, in paragraph 3, these Governors of the Upper State -- of the Upper Basin recommended that as to the all Lower Basin Tributaries, they should go to the states in which they were flowing except that it was a two base -- two-state river that it should be subject to division between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.189" offset="19228087">But it is significant that these four Governors who would be most interested in the Lower Basin tributaries if they were in fact involved, recommended that they be given to the states of the Lower Basin free and clear and without limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.838" offset="19346683">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.870" offset="19346578">Because with respect to the mainstream in paragraph 5, they provided Arizona and California may each divert and use one-half of the other portion of water of the main Colorado River flowing at below Lee's Ferry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.417" offset="19349086">Subject to further equitable apportionment between the states after the year 1963 quickly turning back to Colorado River Compact in Article III (f) provided that after 1963 that there might be a further equitable apportionment of the unapportioned water, the water unapportioned by A, B and C upon application of the Governor of any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.015" offset="19455457">The significant thing?</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.998" offset="19463398">Lower Basin States were not tributaries were not reserve for further equitable apportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.549" offset="19485550">Mainstream, excess flow was reserve for future equitable apportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.712" offset="19514180">Now, if it please the Court, this recommendation of the Governors we believe is equitably reflected in the legislative history became then the vehicle -- the vehicle for working out a settlement and compromise as between California and Arizona in the United States Senate because Arizona and California still could not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.380" offset="19616893">Arizona demanded 4,600,000, the Governor recommended 4,200,000, Arizona stood under 3,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.834" offset="19654719">So that --</text>

            <text syncTime="4908.669" offset="19737997">Now Your Honor engineering wise, hydrologically, any other wise we want to choose that had to be Upper Basin water because Lee Ferry I analogized the minute ago with respect to the two Basins as an hourglass.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.953" offset="19803199">The Upper Basin is defined as that portion of these states which naturally drain into the river above Lee's Ferry which was named as a point a mile below the mouth of the Perry River so that the Lee's Ferry was the point of division.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.239" offset="19876342">It was in effect where the Canyon section which isolate the Lower Basin from the Upper Basin begun to ameliorate something although the Grand Canyon still lies below it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.293" offset="19916570">So that when they said of the annual delivery at Lee's Ferry, there could be no conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.482" offset="19937259">There could be no claim that that did not mean Upper Basin water.</text>

            <text syncTime="5040.288" offset="20264521">As I understand the Master's decision, he held that the water which the Secretary had control over and which he might contract with respect to was water stored in the dam, in other words, it was water which the Congress had authorized him to store and to manage in the interest of navigation and to then apportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.771" offset="20366503">But I would have to make this distinction if it please the Court and if we disagree with the Master we disagree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.286" offset="20396492">I do not think you can read the legislative history of the Project Act particularly in the third – in the second session of the 70th Congress and conclude other than that Congress had reference to the supply of water coming from the Upper Basin that it was to be stored.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.080" offset="20475695">I do not think it can come to the conclusion other than that in effect was dedicated to the purposes of the Project Act including the generation of power and including the related phases of management which necessarily inherent in that type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.982" offset="20539329">But all Congress gave the Secretary power to do was to build the dam and free the reservoir and then manage that reservoir but that doesn't rule out the fact that Congress was looking into the water at Lee Ferry as a supply for that project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.672" offset="20602023">And that doesn't rule out the fact that therefore the Congress has preempted the flow at Lee Ferry for the purposes of the Project Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5384.142" offset="21639920">One, the two projects have both been abandoned, but if that were not true -- that were not true, it could not be done without the Congressional approval and I don't know of any better power to give us authority than the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.663" offset="21710033">Congress has stored this water and the Congress wants to say to Arizona, we authorize you to take some additional water, they are not going to say we're going to charge you for the Lake Mead but this is a body of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.753" offset="21758412">It's as if the situation of Lee Ferry was a fountain, a spring as far as this lawsuit is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.379" offset="21784848">So far as this lawsuit is concerned is the same as if there was a spring at Lee Ferry which gushed out so much water every year because under the Compact, that is the delivery point in the Upper Basin that is the measuring point of the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.719" offset="21838242">And it's just the same as if the Congress have said, “That supply of water used to be dam by the construction of the Boulder Canyon project, it is to be stored.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.493" offset="21881396">And for anyone to commit and say well the State of Arizona or the State of California may (Inaudible) under those circumstances in deep in that body of water and defeat the Project Act, defeat its purpose, defeat the contracts which the Secretary was required to make to provide revenue by depriving the project of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.511" offset="21953390">All of those things simply the reason cries out against them and there's no basis for concluding that the Congress having said to the Secretary, “You, in effect measure this water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.943" offset="21995186">You determine how much of a head you're going to have for generating electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.102" offset="22011800">You determine how much of a supply of electricity you're going to have to sell and then based on that, you determine the piece if only the project and go ahead and build it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.265" offset="22052446">And then to commit and say despite that Arizona can go and take half that water and defeat the project, defeat the computation of the Secretary”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.045" offset="22095600">I can find no basis for that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.409" offset="22108975">They assigned the Rivers and Harbors Act and this point was not urged on his Master -- the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.893" offset="22130918">This point is not made until the argument in New York that this in effect amounted to a permission to Arizona and California to went above the lake and take the water and accordingly, frankly, we haven't thought of this argument and honestly I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.896" offset="22198941">But on reflection upon further thought and upon further reading of the Congressional history, it just doesn't make sense to suggest to having set aside this water for the purpose of this project having considered and measured at Lee Ferry having consider the supply at Lee Ferry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.397" offset="22280965">Having told the Secretary he is to figure out how much water this will supply in the way of water to sell, water to generate power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.494" offset="22313357">And based on that, he is to build the project and then to say that despite that, Arizona or California can commit and take half that water without his consent or the consent of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.046" offset="22359542">That is why, if it please the Court, I quoted with care from the appellates of the case to the effect that it involved not only the Commerce Clause involve not only the matter of navigation but the peripheral and other factors which went to make that exercise of that part feasible or economic.</text>

            <text syncTime="5700.932" offset="22907068">You will note that it has a provision contracts respecting water for domestic use -- for domestic use maybe for a permanent service but subject to rights of prior appropriators.</text>

            <text syncTime="5736.028" offset="23047502">This provision specifically say the rights of prior appropriators and that if it please Mr. Justice Black is one of the reasons for our belief that present perfected rights in pursuance of Article VIII means less than it might mean at first blush because here we have an express provision in the Act as introduced which protected and preserved rights of prior appropriators.</text>

            <text syncTime="5808.979" offset="23339238">The Committee of which I believe at that time Senator Hyrum Johnson was the Chairman deleted the provision, ”may be for permanent service”, and changed it to, “shall be for permanent service”.</text>

            <text syncTime="5988.378" offset="24056874">It has been California's assertion time and time again that this Project Act did not deal with mainstream water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.799" offset="24086549">Well here is the Committee amendment in the first session of the 70th Congress adding this, “provided however that said contracts”, these are the Secretary's contracts, no one can have any water without them, “shall not provide for an aggregate annual consumptive use in California of more than 4,600,000 acre-feet of water allocated to the Lower Basin by the Colorado River Compact mentioned in Section 12 and one-half of the unallocated excess, and or surplus water, provided further, that no such contract shall be made until California, by act of its legislature, shall have ratified and approved the foregoing provision for use of water in said State and then no person shall have or be entitled to have the use for any purpose of the water stored as apportioned except by contract made as herein stated”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6051.681" offset="24310053">In other words, the first limitation on California, the first movement toward the final passage of this Act came in Section 5 and by a virtue of a restriction on the right of the Secretary to contract with respect to water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6070.462" offset="24385181">Now if we are right that this water that was being stored was mainstream water and it's pretty difficult to come to any other conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.552" offset="24421543">We then find that the first mention of a restriction on California, the first attempt to divide this water is how?By limiting the right of the Secretary to contract with respect to how much that water they could give in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="6097.369" offset="24492805">I would like also if you would please note above five lines in the bottom of that, the words appeared that no such contract shall be made until California to the end with the italicized portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6112.286" offset="24552469">Before going to the next amendment which was printed, I'd like to suggest this to the Court that this was a period of foremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.387" offset="24584965">This was a period when subsequent to the Governor's conference unquestionably backroom conferences and front room conferences in California conference and all kinds of conferences were going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6135.160" offset="24644002">We find gradually evolving the notion of how to protect the Upper Basin if Arizona didn't ratify how to reduce Arizona to ratify and that is the purpose of our printing of the next several amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6149.375" offset="24700844">But I want to call one other thing to Your Honors' attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6158.189" offset="24736162">Senator Johnson, Chairman of the Committee -- Chairman of the Committee which reported out this measure made this observation on the floor of the Senate and it appears in 69th Congressional record at 7250.</text>
            <text syncTime="6175.137" offset="24803871">Section 5 provides, “That the contract must be generally for storage and delivery of water and the Secretary shall fix charges to meet the revenue requirements and that contracts for irrigation and domestic uses must be for permanent service”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.067" offset="24871685">An amendment has been inserted here to request to the Upper Basin States offered I think in the Committee by the Senator from Wyoming which provides that and then he quotes the italicized provision you have just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="6205.766" offset="24926438">Then he said, “That is another rigorous provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.735" offset="24942320">A rigorous provision to which those who represent California are willing to consent in order that legislation might be accorded but binding California perpetually and forever to use not to exceed 4,600,000 acre-feet of water”, binding California how?</text>
            <text syncTime="6228.744" offset="25018389">A reasonable limitation upon the power of the Secretary to contract with respect to stored mainstream water and yet to have told time and again, California didn't understand what she was getting into.</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.013" offset="25067395">California built these great projects upon the assumption that she was safe and doing so at least for the system allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6249.407" offset="25101040">Now, I ask Your Honors to note the portion of the italicized Section 5 as it came out the Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="6280.999" offset="25227368">The only significant thing I'm going to call Your Honors' attention to is the fact that he specifically stated, “shall have first ratified and approved all of the provisions of this Section and set in this Act in anyway relating to the use of waters of the mainstream of the Colorado River within or by the State of California or by any virtue of cooperation for said State”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6307.508" offset="25333426">And then on the next page, “That any and all water demanded and required are lawfully appropriated and applied for beneficial use for the State of Arizona or any of its inhabitants including corporations, municipal or otherwise, or any of them out of the mainstream of the Colorado River shall at anytime exceed and so on”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6326.505" offset="25409390">In other words, Senator Waterman clarified and definitely identified what they were talking about was mainstream water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6335.629" offset="25445857">It was water which was in the mainstream of the Colorado River which that I have said before you Your Honors, was the only concern of these people, these Upper Basin States were not concern in the slightest with the uses of our tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="6348.062" offset="25495594">They were concerned with the notion of the tentacles of the Lower Basin reaching up into the Upper Basin by means of an equitable apportionment suit and demanding more water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6356.621" offset="25529866">That's what they were afraid of and that was what they were protecting themselves against and the one thing they were concerned with was mainstream water because Lower Basin tributaries weren't accessible to them, rights are and couldn't be asserted against them because they were not of the supply.</text>
