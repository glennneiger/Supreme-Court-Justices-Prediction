            <label>Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz</label>
            <text syncTime="19.442" offset="181164">This is a case here on certiorari -from the Fourth Circuit involving a seaman in the characterization of Mr. Justice Story awarded the admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.776" offset="250441">The uniqueness is that seldom the case of this import require the intervention or intervent -- interposition as some people might call it of this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.210" offset="324211">There are two questions involved and set forth in our petition, two principal questions, whether or not maintenance is the sto -- is designed to restore post-earnings of itself and the right to maintenance whether it should be unaffected by the incidental earning at shore while the seaman is a patient under treatment, unfit to do seaman's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.613" offset="461824">And there's a second point as to where a shipowner for 23 months has held by both courts below at least in the minority opinion refers to the finding of fact which are conclusive both on the court below and this Court unless the Court goes back to the earlier theory of a new trial both in the Court of Appeals and here in an admiralty case where the shipowner refuses to pay maintenance for 23 months to a sick seaman and for -- thereby forcing the seaman to go to the trouble of an expensive in -- instituting a suit, obtaining a decree of the admiralty court for his maintenance during these 23 months period.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.761" offset="682402">We say that the shipowner cannot escape paying damages merely because the seaman eventually gets well.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.391" offset="720959">And in that, we are supported by the opinion of Chief Judge Sobeloff who wrote the minority orders sending opinion in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.851" offset="778742">Vaughan, the seaman in this case, had been employed aboard the vessel on two previous voyages and -- where he's paid off on March the 2nd, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.157" offset="844048">It's important to keep the dates in mind to show these 23 months dereliction as the trial court on the part of the shipowner for which the seaman was only recompensed to the extent of interest on the weekly payments, they should've had all during these 23 months of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.861" offset="938820">And incidentally, some six months of the final payment was made after the libel was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.669" offset="998066">The case was in court and the trial judge had to take the matter up on two separate occasions before the final payments were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.337" offset="1052714">Now, the -- when the man was discharged, he was given a certificate to enter the marine hospital at Norfolk (ph) which he did on March the 7th and he was examined on that day and told to come back on March the 18th.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <text syncTime="262.108" offset="1151770">The voyage -- the particular trip now -- Your Honors in a case some years ago divided on the question of whether or not the provision, the usual provision in a foreign voyage of a six -- termination, no less than six months or no more than six months rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.611" offset="1245811">Some of Your Honors minority opinion there held that the six months provision prevailed and the majority I think it was a five-four decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.917" offset="1283009">The majority held that it terminated as Your Honor suggested, when the trip was over, he was paid off and got a discharge from the ship no matter what the article might have called for with regard to a minimum period.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.264" offset="1348420">In this case, he received his wages on March the 2nd and then given the certificate entitling him without any cost to either the vessel or to the man to be en -- to enter and be treated at the marine hospital that's covered by a fund that's created out of some of the taxes that the shipowner has to pay in entering and clearing the customs on foreign voyages.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.073" offset="1487705">Now, the man entered the hospital as I've suggested on March the 18th, 1957 and was under treatment until June the 6th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.648" offset="1541935">And during that period under the law, he could not recover any maintenance because he received his board and lodging while he was in the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.604" offset="1589791">But immediately upon leaving the hospital, under the principles enunciated during the day of the (Inaudible), they started the -- the status of the seaman as I've said of being awarded the admiralty because primarily in those days, he couldn't recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.113" offset="1687803">They were killed, there were no death statutes and the -- in most instances, couldn't recover even for an unseaworthy vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.050" offset="1723538">That doctrine came along a hundred years after.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.276" offset="1740466">But he -- from time immemorial got maintenance and cure and that's been thought or furthered away to some extent by the last principles that have been announced that they -- if he can't be cured, if he's beyond cure, then they -- the harsh rule is that the shipowner's liability stops that he -- the only time that the shipowner has to enforce to pay is when there is some possibility of his recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.947" offset="1867212">And he must establish that he has been in the employ of the vessel when this injury or the sickness occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.851" offset="1898768">And that's entirely separate apart from what Your Honors have heard under the Jones Act and under the unseaworthy doctrine as to the liability of the shipowner for damages or any negligent or injury whether willful or not or whether it's a -- as a result of the unseaworthiness of the vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.414" offset="8056978">The only four months he had ever been to sea as a seaman was on the vessel National Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.341" offset="8084773">It's been a good part of his life prior to World War II and for some 12 or 13 years after World Ward II as a taxicab driver.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.944" offset="8531153">Upon release from the Public Health's Hospital in June of 1957, the seaman immediately went to work for his brother who owned a taxicab company in Newport News, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.734" offset="8578278">He wrote a letter to the shipowner, sent him a copy of his medical discharge certificate from the Public Health Hospital, requested a payment of maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.754" offset="8622373">The owner investigated the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.504" offset="8633344">He contacted the master of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.681" offset="8642121">The master of the vessel said, The man had never made any complaint onboard his ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.980" offset="8663333">The law again presented the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.589" offset="8669706">The man had been discharged in the normal course of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.779" offset="8686529">The slip sent by the man to the owner showed that he reported to the hospital more than two weeks after his discharge from the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.888" offset="8722892">Now, this was an admission on -- omission on the part of the seaman and that he did not tell the owner of his original contact with the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.654" offset="8770017">When he had first gone there, they had told him to come back some week or six days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.376" offset="8796871">With these facts, the owner denied any liability and no further contact was heard from the seaman for a period of a year-and-a-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.200" offset="8832188">For a year-and-a-half, he did not report.</text>

            <text syncTime="2196.087" offset="8887672">He worked and then he had paid the services of an attorney and he filed a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.461" offset="8913168">A motion for interlocutory decree for award of maintenance was brought on before the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.211" offset="8940231">It was heard and argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.132" offset="8947858">The District Judge, in an order requiring the shipowner to pay the seaman $8 per day less what he earned as a taxicab driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.760" offset="8990386">Now, the shipowner complied with that decree promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.266" offset="9004387">And he complied with it all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.290" offset="9012537">And this -- I think is of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.585" offset="9021733">The judge did not say to the seaman, You have to continue working as a taxicab driver, but after the decree was entered and after the maintenance pay much were paid, the seaman continued to work for a period of some four months until he had been declared fit for duty as a taxicab driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.796" offset="9094562">And all during this period of approximately two years while this seaman was an outpatient, he was being treated at Public Health Hospital at periodic times, primarily with X-rays.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.483" offset="9149315">He had a suspected chest condition that it was never -- they were never able to determine exactly what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.755" offset="9178363">He was being treated with the knowledge of the physicians that he was doing this particular this type of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.601" offset="9205739">It was not injurious to his health.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.839" offset="9214725">It was a type of work that he had spent most of his adult life doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.553" offset="9241579">In fact, it's not in the record but he has continued to do this work since his discharge from the marine hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.135" offset="9275956">He has not gone back to sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.743" offset="9286301">But they say he's not a professional seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.563" offset="9297586">As to the law here involved, and I think on the law, we stand on a very firm pedestal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.321" offset="9332694">The doctrine of maintenance and cure is an ancient doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.330" offset="9352652">It has its origin in the laws of the Mediterranean lands existing before the time of Christ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.455" offset="9393194">The principle basically was that the seaman employed on a vessel was entitled to be cured at the expense of the owner if he was injured or if he incurred an illness in the service of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.566" offset="9461635">This doctrine came down to our early admiralty courts through the English admiralty courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.129" offset="9487862">It was first enunciated by this Court in the Osceola in 1903.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.792" offset="9522552">It had been followed by the law of admiralty courts in this country since after the revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.269" offset="9548466">The Osceola redefined the right of maintenance and cure saying that the shipowner owed to the seaman the duty to furnish him maintenance and cure until he was fit for duty or until he had reach the form of maximum cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.736" offset="9630281">Following the Osceola in 1904, this Court handed down a decision in the Iroquois which involved a sailing vessel bound from South America to the United States where there's seaman onboard who had suffered an attack of appendicitis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.886" offset="9698931">And the question was whether the master should've put in to the Port of Valparaiso in order to give the man more immediate medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.116" offset="9735816">And there, the court in dicta said that the shipowner had this particular duty to furnish him maintenance and furnish him cure as promptly as possible, that if he did not furnish these elements, that the seaman might have a right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.407" offset="9813034">That was dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.039" offset="9819512">Some 28-29 years later, 1932, this Court handed down the Cortes decision in which a seaman died of pneumonia onboard a vessel at sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.535" offset="9869563">The administrator of the seaman's state claimed that the vessel should've been put into port.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.943" offset="9891192">And there, this Court held that the right of maintenance and cure was a contractual right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.927" offset="9915120">It was a right that grew out of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.499" offset="9925360">It was an implied provision of the seaman's contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.224" offset="9944273">And that if this provision of the contract was breached, then the seaman's administrator in this case had a cause of action for damages, just as you would for the breach of any contract, the damages that naturally float from the breach which would be expensed that the man had to incur for his own maintenance or for the cost of his medical care that he had to employ or for the damage that he may have suffered in the case of Cortes, of the seaman that died.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.434" offset="10113128">Now, the finding in this case was that the refusal of the shipowner to furnish maintenance and cure did not cause this seaman any physical or mental injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.499" offset="10161403">In fact, the requiring of him to go to work was probably a very good therapeutic thing for him to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.199" offset="10212185">If he had suffered any injury, he would have a right of action but he has suffered none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.650" offset="10241964">Now, the Court of Appeals below rested its decision primarily on a very learned decision, handed down by the Second Circuit, Wilson against United States, a decision written by Learned Hand, Judge Lumbard and Judge Medina in which they held that the right of maintenance was contractual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.735" offset="10346350">And it was so contractual that the seaman had a corresponding duty to mitigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.309" offset="10376652">And in that case which I say was on all fours with this particular case, the Second Circuit said that the seaman's earnings, I believe in that case is a dishwasher, were to be credited against the $8 a day that would do him for maintenance.</text>
