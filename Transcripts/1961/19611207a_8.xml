            <label>Mr. Joseph A. Fanelli</label>
            <text syncTime="43.918" offset="279071">Mr. Chief Justice sir, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.136" offset="295894">I appear on behalf of the petitioner, Mr. Russell.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.408" offset="317001">His case is here on the summary calendar for review of his conviction by the District Court here in Washington, which had been affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.658" offset="413968">Our first contention which has absolutely nothing to do with the powers of Congress is that the indictment was invalid for failure to specify the subject of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.914" offset="495052">And the question, in view of something that Mr. Silard said in the Shelton case which preceded in this case is not whether the indictment failed precisely to -- to specify a subject of inquiry, but rather whether it has to say something about the subject of inquiry because in this case, as is true in the other five contempt cases now before the Court, there was nothing stated as to the subject of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.412" offset="632978">Here, the questions upon which your petitioner was indicted are set forth in individual counts and then with respect to all of them, the indictment merely says that the questions were pertinent to the question then on under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.574" offset="721690">Nothing further, just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.493" offset="737364">In the course of this argument, I shall use the term subject of inquiry rather than question of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.779" offset="778533">In the Cruikshank case decided as well to go as the 92 volume of your official reports, this Court established a rule which had been prefigured and foreshadowed by decisions in the lower federal courts that when a statute defines an offense in generics terms, as the contempt statute does, that an indictment setting forth an offence pursuant to that statute must dissent its -- such an act were, must dissent to particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.351" offset="968808">In the 85 years since this Court's decision in Cruikshank, that case has been applied repeatedly and continuously and up until just last year in the lower federal courts to invalidate indictments attempting to allege various types of crime for failure to state factual particulars instead of statutory generic terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.729" offset="1114258">And a basic reason even in this Court and in the law of federal courts for such invalidation is that where an indictment uses generic terms instead of particulars, the defendant is deprived of his right under the Sixth Amendment to be apprised with reasonable certainty of the accusation against him so that he may prepare his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.798" offset="1274546">Now, we do not reduce from the Cruikshank case and the long line of cases that have followed it and applied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.776" offset="1314461">We do not reduce and we do not urge that any indictment is invalid if for any generic statutory term, all of the particulars are not given.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.174" offset="1380080">We readily admit that so broad a rule, applied in some cases wouldn't make much sense (Voice Overlap)</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph A. Fanelli</label>
            <text syncTime="350.519" offset="1505468">No, we did not but I will reach that point in just about five minute, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.006" offset="1523440">Your Honor, I may just now in its real question that the Government made an opening statement that was quite revealing at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.517" offset="1565445">For example, in terms of a case where the Cruikshank rule might not make any sense is a -- that at the periphery of a -- the statutory offence of perjury is the requirement, that a witness had been sworn, that an indictment which fails to state the name of the person who administered the oath is not fair for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.294" offset="1680593">The name of that person is a simple, easily identified fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.963" offset="1703267">It is open to the defendant's easy investigation or to being obtained from the prosecution upon a bills of particulars and the name of the person who administered the oath is the same whether the indictment states it, whether the defendant obtains it on his own investigation or whether the prosecution supplies it by interrogatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.567" offset="1793651">That essentially is the Debrow case upon which the Government relies as being applicable here but that case which makes, we don't doubt, considerable sets in the context in which it would have -- was applied, makes no sense in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.329" offset="1884662">Of course, this Court does not set to apply by rule, even the well established Cruikshank line of cases or a somewhat new and novel rule that the Government suggests here that the indictments in statutory terms are generally good.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.314" offset="1956655">We take it that that this case like other cases must be decided in its own context and I turn to that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.211" offset="1988211">But I note in passing that as to the point that I am now discussing namely, whether this statute is invalid, I'm sorry this indictment is invalid for failure to specify the subject of inquiry, the context of this case is not so far as I am aware significantly different for any of the other five cases now before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="534.186" offset="2240136">The first important aspect of the subject -- of the context to this case is -- that in this type of contempt case and by type, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I mean contempt of Congress' cases, the subject of inquiry is generally a very difficult thing to ascertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.039" offset="2359568">It is true that those who believe that they have ascertained it, stated with confidence but different charges with equal confidence state different subjects of inquiry in the same case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph A. Fanelli</label>
            <text syncTime="582.703" offset="2434173">I think they might, yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.975" offset="2451310">One need only compare the opinions of this Court in the Watkins and Sacher cases with the opinions of the court below in those same cases or as another example, one need only compare the majority and dissenting opinions of this Court in Deutch, but in any event in this case, the subject of inquiry was a very difficult thing to ascertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.642" offset="2593938">As to the Government's position on it, they have always been confident that the subject of inquiry has been very clear, but it's been a different subject of inquiry at every level of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.989" offset="2647333">At trial, the Government's basic position was that the subject of inquiry was no less than House Resolution Number 5, the resolution which empowers a House Committee on un-American activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.557" offset="2721625">At the same time at trial in a feeble to prove something which the Government calls special pertinence, some dozen-and-a-half possible subjects of inquiry were introduced but they were not hooked up in any way to this petitioner or the questions asked of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.832" offset="2814725">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the Government again was asserting of what the subject of inquiry was.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.985" offset="2851297">I must take that in their brief in the Court of Appeals, it was stated somewhat ambiguously, but apparently the subject of inquiry was infiltration of communism among the leadership of the United Electrical Radio and Machine Workers of America or just possibly communist policy of colonization in essential industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.721" offset="2958294">In this Court, the Government has remained confident of what was the subject of inquiry at the time the petitioner testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.944" offset="2995179">In its brief and opposition that subject of inquiry according to the Government very clear, Communist activity at Anitoch College and now on its brief on the merits, the Government at least is consistent on the confidence with which it defines the subject of inquiry, now on its brief on the merits, the subject of inquiry has become communist activity and the Dayton Yellow Springs area.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.458" offset="3133210">On the congressional side, there has been somewhat more confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.048" offset="3159542">The chairman of the subcommittee made an announcement that the outset of the hearings at which petitioner appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.378" offset="3196844">The announcement covers some six pages of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.324" offset="3212622">It recites a number of subjects that are not claimed to have any connection with the petitioner or the questions which he was asked and the (Inaudible) began in a time that must have been some five seconds, it mentions, as the chairman mentions in his announcement, that there was some sort of controversy in the Dayton Yellow Springs area.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.812" offset="3314604">He doesn't state what the controversy was and he explicitly states that Committee is going to stay out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.728" offset="3342294">Then he goes on the say that complaints and just that complaints, not from whom or what about but just complaints from the Dayton Yellow Springs area had left to the series of hearings at which your petitioner testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.492" offset="3433305">But at the trial, when we sought to ascertain what these complaints from the Dayton Yellow Springs area were about, counsel for the Government objected made the explicit statement that our questions seeking to ascertain what was the nature of these complaints was “not relevant to any issue in this case” stated that we were just on a remote fishing expedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.697" offset="3570186">The Court agreed with them and we were unable to ascertain what the complaints were about.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.991" offset="3599339">And Committee counsel who testified at the trial, at the behalf of the Government testified that the hearings at which petitioner testified or appeared that the subject of inquiry that there wasn't any particular subject of inquiry or in other words that the Committee was pursuing no subject less than House Resolution Number 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.363" offset="3724831">So that at the beginning of the trial by the opening statement, during the course of the trial by our attempts to ascertain what these complaints from the Yellow Springs, Dayton Yellow Springs area were about and at the end of the trial when Committee counsel, who was the Government's last witness to testify, the Government consistently took the position at trial that the subject of inquiry was no different from, no more than, no less than but was House Resolution Number 5, the so called shadow of the House on American activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.629" offset="3985847">-- Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.497" offset="3993370">Just before the recess, I was covering the aspect of the context here which is namely that the subject of inquiry in this case was a very difficult thing to ascertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.783" offset="4042480">And in that connection, I have one more item to mention on the congressional side namely that the annual report of the Committee which was again introduced by the Government at the trial in this case states that the subject under inquiry when petitioner was testifying was, “Communist infiltration in basic industries throughout the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.844" offset="4162748">At the same time, however, the annual report goes on to say that during the course of these hearings at which petitioner testified, several witnesses from institutions of higher learning were called apparently as site excursion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.905" offset="4230980">As I have already noted in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, the grand jury, the trial judge, the Court of Appeals all found that the questions here were pertinent to the subject of inquiry but all managed to do so without statement of what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.996" offset="4303391">In short Your Honors, the subject of inquiry here is so difficult to ascertain that grand jury, trial judge and Court of Appeals stood silent on the subject and now, the Government clearly discerns a subject of inquiry namely communist activity in the Dayton Yellow Springs area which it specifically disavowed at trial as not related to any issue in this case and therefore part of a fishing expedition by the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.573" offset="4437661">The second important aspect of the context here with -- with relation to this point is that this elusive thing, this thing that is so difficult to ascertain, this subject of inquiry is essential as the Court noted in Deutch to the -- to determination and therefore also to defense on at least four central issues in a contempt of Congress case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.919" offset="4559078">Three constitutional issues namely, whether the subject transgresses First Amendment limitations, a second constitutional issue as to whether the subject of inquiry found was delegated by the Congress to this Committee and then again to the subcommittee, a third constitutional issue namely the due process, one as to whether the witness was appraised of the pertinence of the questions and the non-constitutional issue, part of the statutory offense whether the questions were pertinent to the subject of inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.342" offset="5120711">So far as the petitioner is concerned, it is the failure of the grand jury to specify the subject of inquiry in this indictment that makes it possible for the prosecution to convict petitioner on House Resolution Number 5 as the subject of inquiry to get the conviction affirmed on another subject of inquiry and to argue here for affirmance on a third subject of inquiry that was disavowed as -- at trial as unrelated to any of the issues in part of a fishing expedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.891" offset="5258951">The prosecution now says that we should have asked for a bill of particulars, but in answer to that suggestion, we say first, that it is the only grand jury's specification of the subject under inquiry that effectively confines the prosecution to one due process channel of prosecution for one charged offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1521.856" offset="6190791">But here, the situation is much worse than the difficulties of Court faced in Watkins because the indictment does not specify the subject of inquiry, this Court can be almost certain but not absolutely certain that the grand jury found House Resolution Number 5 as the subject of inquiry from which it found probable cause for pertinence because that was the Government's position at that time in the pre-Watkins phase, that is in the days before this Court's decision in Watkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.557" offset="6329553">That was the Government's uniform and basic position in this case and in every other contempt to Congress case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.519" offset="6365497">This Court can be almost certain, but not absolutely certain that the trial judge also convicted on the basis of House Resolution Number 5, which under the Watkins case is impermissible subject of inquiry, being too vague and third, this Court can be almost certain but not absolutely certain that the Court of Appeals impermissibly in view of Cardiaco and Stirone and etcetera affirmed that conviction on the basis of still a -- another subject of inquiry although we don't know what it was because by that time, this Court had decided the Watkins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.838" offset="6550758">A fourth and important aspect of this context is that to approve of this indictment is to sanction a most extraordinary violation of the well-settled rule against amendments of indictments by trial court or by prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.956" offset="6623169">Here, the grand jury left the blank at the very center of this case that settle upon which at least those four important questions depend which the Government, the trial judge and the Court of Appeals could fill in at will and did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.248" offset="6696312">And fifth and lastly and maybe most importantly is that once the grand jury has done its duty and ascertained a subject of inquiry on the basis of which it confined the probable cause to charge an offence pursuant to the contempt statute which of course is the grand jury's function and we don't understand that the Government denies that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.007" offset="6799444">The subject of inquiry is stated in the indictment simply without difficulty and in just a few words as Mr. Terris said to in the course of the Shelton case argument, its communist activity and infiltration of news media or here, communist activity in the Dayton Yellow Springs area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.760" offset="6890454">It is no difficulty at all for the grand jury or the Government to state it once the grand jury has performed its function and found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.952" offset="6931205">Indeed, that is just the case of Lorch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.950" offset="6943222">Lorch testified at the same hearings of which petitioner testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.450" offset="6961194">He was first indicted by precisely the same sort of amendment as here, but the trial court out in the Southern District of Ohio dismissed that indictment for failure to specify the subject of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.208" offset="7012185">The Government went back to the grand jury and got an indictment which states that the subject of inquiry at the time was communist activities in the Dayton Yellow Springs area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.886" offset="7054921">And if the subject of inquiry stated in just a few words, the defendant can prepare his arguments in defense and the Courts can intelligently decide on such issues has is the subject of inquiry sufficiently definite, is it within the Committee's delegated powers, is it one which outweighs the concomitant First Amendment transgressions, were the questions pertinent to it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.370" offset="7152828">Was the witness had far as of that pertinence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.481" offset="7165262">In fine, the Government insists on indictments which do not specify the subject of inquiry although there is every reason in affording the defense an opportunity for defense and in affor -- and affording the Courts an opportunity for intelligent review to insist on that specification and no reason at all for not specifying it except that prosecution can be obtained and affirmed more readily because of the very prejudice to the -- to defense and to the Courts in their Article III duty which results from non-specification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.244" offset="7348328">In the Sinclair case, the Court stated that the Government must plead pertinence in a contempt of Congress case and surely in view of the considerations we have advanced this Court must have meant more than the empty ritual of having the Assistant United States Attorney who's accredited to the grand jury read the statute and see that it's quoted accurately in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.035" offset="7451564">The Government relies heavily on the Markham case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.588" offset="7465775">This was a perjury case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.881" offset="7474866">The Government says that it holds -- that in a perjury case, you don't have to state the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.494" offset="7509347">And the Government says further the perjury case is just like contempt of Congress cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.186" offset="7528155">We say first that in the Markham case, the opinion explicitly states and the record shows that the inquiry in the Markham case was, as this Court stated, manifest on the face of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.675" offset="7590118">Moreover, as we've already noted, in a contempt of Congress case, unlike a perjury case, knowledge of the subject of inquiry is the touchstone to defense and judicial solution on practically all of the important issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.683" offset="7662111">We might note further that per --</text>

            <text syncTime="2182.905" offset="8835009">Well, we were -- we were trying to -- to make it for the convenience of the Court so that we wouldn't be unnecessarily repeating legal arguments in each brief which were common to several cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.332" offset="8892688">And our -- we tried to -- to -- to develop a -- a master brief so called since these cases were all set together and to try to eliminate, insofar as possible, unnecessary duplicate reading as to what our position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.591" offset="8985788">At any rate, Your Honor, the Markham case which -- which we do refer to in -- at -- in the Shelton brief at page 80, the Court there held that the mere averment that the false statement was material to the matter under inquiry by the Veterans Administration was sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.042" offset="9095502">The averment of materiality in a perjury case is directly analogous it seems to us, to the averment of subject matter and pertinency in a contempt of Congress case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.908" offset="9147016">And it is our position that in -- in light of the established principles of these cases, the allegation that the -- there was a subject under inquiry and that the questions refused of answer were pertinent to those -- to that inquiry is a sufficient averment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.662" offset="9229981">What the subject under inquiry was -- is a matter of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.358" offset="9252760">The -- the circumstances which demonstrate the pertinency of the particular questions is that -- to the subject under inquiry is a matter of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.974" offset="9319320">Now, we think it also well-established that -- as established in the Markham case and in the Debrow case that the -- the test for the sufficiency of an indictment is whether or not it sufficiently appraises as a defense of the specific charge for which he is to be tried and enables him to prepare a defense and whether it is sufficiently precise to enable to him to plead it in bar of a subsequent prosecution for the same offense and we submit the indictments in these cases, particularly in this case meets that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.138" offset="9511894">Now, the contention is made that because the subject under inquiry is a nebulously, that -- in view of that particular of circumstance in this type of case, the Court should depart from the general principle as to the sufficiency of indictments and require, especially as concerns contempt of Congress cases that the Government or that the grand jury set fourth in the indictment what the subject under inquiry was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.337" offset="9684720">On the other hand, we think that when the -- when a defendant is appraised as he was in this indictment and in the other indictments of the subcommittee or the Committee concerning which he is alleged to have appeared and to have refused to answer questions, when the specific questions are set forth in the indictment as they are all of these cases, together with the allegations that they were pertinent to the subject then under inquiry that he is in a position to prepare his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.565" offset="9845635">The record here -- the -- the hearings of the Committee which are available to him in connection with the preparation of -- for trial, in this particular case leave no room for doubt so as to confuse a defendant with what he has to meet in a -- in the criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.543" offset="9957543">The -- this record shows that the Committee or that -- the Committee which conducted the hearings in Dayton as distinguished from a subsequent Committee which followed up on those hearings here in Washington and that which the petitioner appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.422" offset="10045106">The -- the Committee in Dayton announced at the beginning of the hearings that it was going to investigate communist activities generally in the Dayton and Yellow Springs area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.842" offset="10106755">Now, the opening statement does refer to a lot of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.741" offset="10122324">It refers to legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.246" offset="10128384">It refers to the communist conspiracy and the international situation and so forth, but I don't think there can be any doubt from an overall reading of that as to what the Committee intended to do at these hearings in Dayton that is to investigate communist activities in that area, Dayton and Yellow Springs area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.209" offset="10216260">Now, if there where any doubt from the opening statement, the hearings themselves and the questions which were put to the particular witnesses demonstrate beyond all question that the Committee's interest and that the Committee's area of inquiry was communist activities in the Dayton, Yellow Springs area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.706" offset="10330154">They -- they interrogated the witness Strunk concerning his knowledge of the organizational structure in the Dayton area, his knowledge of certain leaders of the Communist Party in that area, his knowledge of Communist Party infiltration in -- in that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.129" offset="10439868">There were other witnesses called who testified as to communist activities in the Yellow Springs area, as to the existence of a young communist leagues cell at Antioch College which is in Yellow Springs, as to the petitioner's membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.127" offset="10527848">All those things and only that type of thing were developed throughout the hearings conducted in Dayton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.509" offset="10569435">Now, if that weren't enough, and I think that this Court clearly, in the Watkins case and in the Barenblatt cases, said that the subject done under inquiry can be determined from the statement of the chairman at the outset of the hearings, from the resolution of the Committee here concededly as the Court has held in the Watkins case, the resolution itself does not add materially to a determination of what the subject under inquiry was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.511" offset="10709452">What the opening statement does and properly can, the interrogation of the witnesses at the hearings do in this case unquestionably, establish that this Committee was inquiring into communist activities generally in the Dayton and Yellow Springs area and in conducting such a general investigation, it necessarily, as any such investigation would, encompassed within such a general investigation certain, more specialized, more particularized subjects, infiltration of the Communist Party in to the UE the United Electrical Workers' union.</text>

            <text syncTime="2696.838" offset="10890742">In the Dayton and area, yes sir and several leaders of the UE were called and were asked to testify concerning certain strike activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.407" offset="10937031">I think particularly concerning a Univis -- a strike at the Univis Lens Corporation which is in that area at which the Committee tried to develop to what extent the Communist Party and its leaders had been sent in during that strike to, you sir so to speak, the functions of the union in the conduct of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.037" offset="11035564">Now, as I say, if that were not enough, when the witness -- this witness himself, the petitioner came before the Committee, he was not left floundering at all for what the Committee was trying to find out from him when he first -- he answered preliminary questions, and these statements which I'll try to paraphrase begin in the record of pages 123.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.475" offset="11165236">He has -- he was -- he asked preliminary questions as to his attendance at Antioch as to his working in Yellow Springs during the critical time period, his working in Antioch and his residence there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.543" offset="11225527">He -- he was told by both Committee counsel and by the members of the Committee, and beginning down at the bottom of 123, they made reference to two witnesses who would appear the date of the hearings, John O'Brien and BB O'Brien, husband and wife who had testified as to their prior membership in the Communist Party and who had testified as to the existence of a young communist league cell at Antioch College in about 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.174" offset="11372022">Their testimony also demonstrated that the leader and the organizer of this young communist league group at Antioch was Herbert Reed, who was a Communist Party functionary from Dayton, who had no connection with Antioch College as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.860" offset="11446836">But that he had come in to the -- to the campus and had organized this YCL group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.242" offset="11476302">They also referred the witness to testimony that had been given before the -- the Committee at the Dayton hearings, testimony of Professor Robert Matchan who was on the faculty at Antioch and which indicated to the Committee's satisfaction the existence of a Communist Party group in 1945 or 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.635" offset="11581942">And they -- they said after having made those points to the petitioner, they said on page 126 of the record at the -- at the top, having referred to the YCL group in 1942 at Antioch and the 1945 Communist Party Cell at which certain members of the faculty or of which certain members of the faculty were members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.472" offset="11697298">They say, now there's an important link in between the actual organizers; Communist Party organizers in 1945 were not known.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.714" offset="11734183">You may be in a position to supply that information to the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.917" offset="11755081">We know what it was in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.206" offset="11764172">We are asking you now to supply the missing link to that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.116" offset="11787786">The -- the -- the other evidence that Committee had, had already demonstrated that he -- he had been or at least he was identified as having been a member of the Communist Party at about this time, he's working in this area and certainly there was the likelihood that he could furnish for the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.841" offset="11866781">If he would -- whatever information he had, which might shed -- shed information on the three-year period of Communist activities between Dayton and Yellow Springs and Antioch of which the Committee had a void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.509" offset="11965419">He was told that he -- he was told I think very clearly, that is the information we're trying to get from you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.937" offset="11999169">This is the reason why we think you can give it to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.059" offset="12011604">Will you answer this question, or several questions and his reply was that he refused on the basis of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.313" offset="12044622">Now we think no circumstances that there is just no question at all that this petitioner in preparing his case for trial on the criminal contempt charge certainly was in a position to properly prepare his defense and to make whatever defenses he had available to him, and that being the case we submit that this indictment meets quite far the test for the sufficiency of an indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.494" offset="12253393">The record -- the record contains that information and I think the petitioner -- this petitioner is during the course of his testimony before the Committee, they asked him if he -- he went back and forth, and he said they were about 20 miles apart and that he did go back and forth during this time and Antioch -- Antioch College is in Yellow Springs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.332" offset="12372720">Now, the -- another point which is -- which was not made orally, but which has been extensively briefed in this case, and which is also raised in several of the other cases which are to be heard after this concerns motions of the petitioners in a number of these cases including this case made before trial to dismiss the indictments, to dismiss this indictment, I'll confine it to this case, motion to dismiss this indictment or in the alternative for a hearing on the ground that more than -- that 13 or more of the indicting grand jurors were employees of the Federal or District Government, and therefore, according to affidavits submitted in support of the motions, affidavits which are principally I might say, based on the opinions of their counsel and in this case, on a preliminary survey resulting in opinions expressed by Professors Jahoda and Cooke, opinions to the effect that a government employee in 1954 necessarily would have been so intimidated and so fearful as a result of the Government Loyalty Program that he ought to be held as a matter of law to be a biased grand juror in this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.842" offset="12838745">Now, basically our primary contention is that the supporting affidavits in these cases which were submitted in support of the motion to dismiss, and in the alternative for a motion, for a preliminary hearing on that question do not contain any specific facts as to actual bias by these particular grand jurors, and we think that since that is so at the under the -- under the case law and under the -- what appears to us to be the prevailing rule with respect to challenges to grand juries that these petitioners -- this petitioner was not entitled either to a hearing, certainly was not entitled to a dismiss along the indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3258.877" offset="13138840">There originally was a statute or a provision which disqualified government employees from service as jurors in the District of Columbia, and because of the difficultly of getting grand jury -- jury panels, Congress passed a statute in I think it was 1908 or thereabouts, which was the subject of this Court's decision in the case of Wood v. United States which is cited also in our Shelton brief, it's 299 U.S. 123.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.128" offset="13387839">In -- in that case, this Court held that that statute authorizing government employees to sit as jurors in criminal cases in the District of Columbia was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.079" offset="13451682">The question of government employees sitting in criminal -- as jurors in criminal cases in the District also was considered by this Court in the Frazier case, which is also cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.994" offset="13507375">The Frazier case involved a -- a prosecution of an individual for violation of the narcotics laws I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.548" offset="13545514">The defendant challenged the impartiality as a -- as a matter of implied bias of a government employee rendering a fair and impartial verdict in a case where the Government, where his employer was the -- was the prosecutor, was the party to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.453" offset="13637151">And this Court held that the fact of government employment did not render a government employee impartial as a matter of law, as a matter of showing in any particular case with respect to any particular juror that he -- he was in fact intimidated by virtue of his employment could be shown on voir dire examination and of course would be a proper question for voir dire examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.838" offset="13798693">But in the absence of such is showing as to actual bias or fear on the part of the particular juror, the Court would not impute from the circumstances of employment alone that he was not an impartial jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="4402.728" offset="17714239">I'd like to state while I have the time and while it hasn't run out that we argue not only the invalidity of this indictment for the failure to specify the subject under inquiry, not only the subject that Mr. Justice Whittaker referred to, that is failure to prove a permissible subject of inquiry, not only the subject that my brother counsel touched on in the latter part of his argument that the indictment was invalid for an additional reason, but we also argue that the defendant was called for the purpose of punishing him for contempt rather than on legislative aid, on the particular facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.774" offset="17922487">Also, under the Yates Case that he committed one indict -- one offense which was a committed one -- one offense for -- unlike Yates, not the offense for which he was indicted and that therefore, this conviction must be reversed for that reason and four reversible in prejudicial errors that occurred at trial in a particular aspect of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4484.652" offset="18042023">I would like to spend just one moment on the specification of subject of inquiry in the indictment and then touch for a few moments on the grand jury point.</text>

            <text syncTime="4503.423" offset="18117047">I'm afraid that my brother counsel has pretty well-demonstrated what has always been my feeling about this subject of inquiry that once you think you have it, you're very confident about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.351" offset="18164799">I will repeat that the subject of inquiry now claimed was specifically disavowed at trial and I might point out in addition that as to the Univis Lens -- Univis Lens strike, the United Electrical and Radio Workers which occupied a lot of time in this hearing have no relation at all to the questions ask to the petitioner, and that the only statement as to petitioner was, that he was not involved in that strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.490" offset="18297292">I want to say in the end that as to Markham, as I've stated, the Court found the inquiry manifest on the face of the indictment and record supports the Court on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4800.829" offset="19306663">As the Chief Justice drew from the Government, they don't seem to provide any avenue for testing this, but at least they concede that much and then in any event, this Court has said again and again that one of a defendant's rights is to an impartial, or rather the word that has been used is unbiased or non-biased grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.587" offset="19405720">I want to say to Mr. Justice Whittaker that it is not our contention that government employees are prohibited from sitting in prosecutions by the United States and I want to say to Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that we are not arguing anything but a grand jury which sat in Washington D.C., in or about 1954, as this grand jury did with a majority of government employees in a case related to the National Security of the United States or more specifically to communism and we say as to that type of case and not grand jury that it was not qualified to pass upon probable cause in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4898.992" offset="19699336">What we are saying is that for a grand jury in 1954, to have honored in a case involving the National Security, or communism if you will, the two are frequently acquitted although I think there are differences, a majority of government employees who have just been through seven years of the intimidation and oppression of loyalty-security programs, that a grand jury sitting at that point could not validly have honored a majority of government employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="5000.183" offset="20104129">The in most dissenting opinions, those Justices took judicial notice of what we have proven in this case, and what became obvious by 1954 when we reached the stake in this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.696" offset="20162121">I wish I could evoke it but one need only read Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion in Dennis or Mr. Justice Black's also, when we reached the period, when one could say what the profit might give that hunts every men his brother with a neck and we're just slowly emerging from that, but I'm not arguing about a grand jury sitting today or in another type of case, no one that sat in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.534" offset="20273507">We do argue with subsidiary contention namely that we were at least entitled to a hearing, and that to grant us a hearing today under bias is not the same as a hearing then because as we put it, when the battle is over, all men would pray, and you can extract this fear now, and that therefore the indictment should be dismissed on that ground.</text>
