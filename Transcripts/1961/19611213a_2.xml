            <text syncTime="32.036" offset="231528">This controversy was before this Court, was before at the 1959 term, at that time on appeal from the interim District Court for the State of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.239" offset="280325">This Court noted at that time that another appeal from the same trial court decision was pending in the Alaska Supreme Court and ordered appellants to pursue their remedies in the Alaska Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="85.850" offset="446777">As I shall try to point out later on with regard to this opinion, the opinion of the Alaska Supreme Court, as far as Metlakatla is concerned, the State of Alaska, one week ago, when it filed its brief in this Court, stopped defending the theory of law on which the Alaska Supreme Court decided the case and has advanced now a new theory for the first time in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.877" offset="546879">And in this context, may it please the Court, I would like to call your particular attention to our reply brief, which is now addressed to the Alaska -- to the State of Alaskaâ€™s new theory as distinct from our opening brief addressed to the decision below which is no longer defended by the State of Alaska as far as Metlakatla is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.410" offset="725034">The Alaska Supreme Court decided this case on -- by holding certain federal statutes invalid either because of some defect in them, in the statute itself namely the 1891 Act which established the Reservation, the Presidential Proclamation of 1916, Section 4 of the Alaska Statehood Act and all the way through -- entered as unconstitutionality of the statutes, incidentally, even -- even though this Court in 1918 sustained the 1891 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.351" offset="956792">As a matter fact, the way the Alaska Supreme Court decided this case and my theory of it is that Alaska might go back wrapped under it because it would pull out the reasons for federal financial support to Indians in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.414" offset="1021053">The way the Alaska Supreme Court decided the case, conceivably this reservation, the Metlakatla Reservation no longer exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.745" offset="1050311">This is no longer suggested by the State of Alaska and as a matter fact in their brief they say that they don't have to go as far as the Alaska Supreme Court did.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.561" offset="1285622">The basic question involved here is the fact that these three Indian fishing communities in Alaska have been authorized many years and continued to be authorized by the Secretary of Interior to maintain a fishing device known as a fish trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.852" offset="1378826">The State of Alaska has attempted to outlaw the use of fish traps and has under the decision of the Alaska Supreme Court now, applied that statute to the fish traps maintained by the three fishing communities involving this case, Metlakatla, Kake and Angoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.383" offset="1456880">The controversy is therefore one in which the Indian Communities and the United States find themselves on one side and the State of Alaska on the other.</text>
