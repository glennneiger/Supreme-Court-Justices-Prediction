            <text syncTime="92.780" offset="474467">If the use tax as it now exists (falling only upon goods which have crossed state line).</text>
            <text syncTime="100.881" offset="506859">A use tax in that nature if it stood alone and there were no comparable intrastate sales tax, we submit that that be -- unconstitutionality would be rather obvious.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="112.268" offset="552417">Mr. Taylor, one thing that's bothering me is this, suppose there were two manufacturing plants in this city of -- in Oklahoma and one of them was yours where you manufactured this equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.129" offset="627858">Next to you is another one that -- another plant and that manufactured them for sale and you brought them -- brought them into the State, they, one of theirs, you, one of yours on the same car, let's say in railroad car and you got to the -- you got to the Louisiana line.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.966" offset="723257">And you insisted that you only be charged for the materials, the tax on the materials that are involved and that the other should be taxed on both materials and labor and in shop equipment merely because they're going to sell in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.076" offset="803715">Would there not be -- or would there be, let me say a discrimination as against the other party?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="benjamin_b_taylor_jr" startTime="182.595" stopTime="318.731">
            <label>Mr. Benjamin B. Taylor, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="182.595" offset="833703">Now in that case Your Honor, you're -- you are supposing that they were two interstate operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.058" offset="859617">Now, there's nothing parenthetically requires -- the Interstate Commerce Clause doesn't cover two interstate operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.616" offset="897860">You'd get over to due process, but again, I miss -- I'm getting away from my point.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.636" offset="913951">What -- my point is this, if Halliburton were selling then the appropriate comparison would be Halliburton the interstate salesman with an intrastate salesman, since Halliburton is not selling but he's manufacturing for his own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.298" offset="996603">We submit that the proper comparison is between Halliburton, the interstate manufacturer-user and comparable intrastate comparab -- intrastate manufacturer-user.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.695" offset="1050102">One of the basic fallacies sir as we see it at the Louisiana Supreme Court and of the Louisiana Collector is that in their test for discrimination, they do compare such unlike dissimilar and non-comparable transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.401" offset="1108929">And if they make that argument here today and we anticipate that they will, we would like the attention of this Court to be already focused upon its area and speciousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.329" offset="1144665">It is totally impossible for the Collector of Revenue of the State of Louisiana to sustain his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.584" offset="1169742">We say impossible, and we say that deliberately, sustain his position on the labor and shop overhead fees that is if there's no arbitrary tax discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.724" offset="1206314">If he does make a fair comparison between two comparable economic activities, one interstate and the other intrastate, we submit that the test for discrimination one must compare comparables, that the only fair comparison is to compare the tax burden of an outers to out-of-state.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.177" offset="1280084">That is an interstate manufacturer-user such as Halliburton with the tax burden of a comparable intrastate manufacturer-user.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.585" offset="1317700">In other words, if Halliburton had a direct competitor in Louisiana, in exactly the same business operation lacking only the interstate commerce's element with the tax burden of each be the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.731" offset="1378304">Well if -- are you saying then that you don't question that Louisiana made for purposes of classification setup a classification of manufacturer-user but that within that classification, it may not discriminate between the out-of-state manufacturer-user and the intrastate manufacturer-user?</text>

            <text syncTime="360.432" offset="1545070">If Halliburton came into Louisiana and sold it, it would be proper to compare them with a wholly intrastate operation where the operation was simply a sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.770" offset="1622497">We say that since the collector has stipulated that the burden here would be three-to-one as compared to an intrastate manufacturer-user, that's actually a little misleading.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.170" offset="2332087">Now, let's suppose that in the Louisiana tax, in the next legislature, they should say in Louisiana, automobiles are going to be exempted from the sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.644" offset="2377958">I don't think that they could collect a use tax on imported automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.699" offset="2394154">I think by definition, it would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.853" offset="2410768">Now, one of the incredible things that I think you gentlemen will find in this brief amicus curiae, one of the briefs amicus curiae is that Louisiana fields are total freedom, a total freedom to exempt from the sales tax without any comparable exemption from the use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.527" offset="2485478">Incredibly, they got an exemption from the sales tax of "vessels and ships and ships and supplies and vessel supplies if made in Louisiana shipyards."</text>
            <text syncTime="608.275" offset="2536469">If this Court says that the use tax -- if this Court should uphold them in saying that the use tax, the interstate tax shall be heavier than the intrastate sales tax, then we submit that they could refill the sales tax and keep the use tax and we submit that by implication, this Court would uphold that incredible exemption, exemption from the sales tax of vessels made in Louisiana shipyards.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.516" offset="2637406">If you have a vessel that's made in Louisiana shipyard and it's sold, there's no sale on the original transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.110" offset="2659767">If it's resold in the casual sale, there's no sale -- sales tax on the original transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.084" offset="2679724">If you go across the Biloxi though or to some state that doesn't have a sales tax law and you'd get a vessel and you trailer it back -- float it back through the Rigolets into Louisiana then when you bring it up to the state line they collect -- they'd flagged you down say, "That's not a vessel that was made in Louisiana, pay me 2% use tax.”</text>
            <text syncTime="661.500" offset="2749419">The collector feels an incredible freedom we feel here to discriminate against interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="680.679" offset="2826115">Henneford versus Silas Mason Company in that case, this High Court upheld a use tax of the State of Washington, although it fell only upon transactions involving interstate commerce because in the case then at bar, the use tax of the State of Washington did not exceed the state -- the sales tax of the same state but was merely complementary to and precisely equal to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.783" offset="2922454">And therefore, the use tax did not discriminate and hence did not offend the Interstate Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.884" offset="2946905">Now, it is unquestionable we submit that this was the rationale of the Henneford case.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.263" offset="2972400">In the Henneford versus Silas Mason case, Mr. Justice Cardozo had this to say, "Equality is the theme that runs through all sections of the Washington statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.588" offset="3009703">When the account is made up, the stranger from afar is subject to no great burdens than the dweller within the gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.799" offset="3030601">In each situation, the burden of a use tax is balanced by an equal burden of the sales tax where the sale is strictly local.”</text>
            <text syncTime="738.183" offset="3056097">And Mr. Justice Cardozo concluded a non-discriminatory tax has never been regarded as imposing a direct burden upon the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.020" offset="3091414">Now, it's our simple position here today that implicit in the Silas Mason case and correctly so is that whenever the interstate use tax does levy a burden which is heavier than the burden of the comparably intrastate sale tax in an identical situation, minus only the element of interstate commerce, then the interstate use tax, it does discriminate him because of such discrimination is violative of the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.694" offset="3182111">In Silas Mason, the use tax was upheld because it was not heavier than the sales tax and therefore no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.777" offset="3206457">All we seek here is what seems to us to be the already implicit corollary ruling that if in a given case the use tax is heavier than the sales tax then it does discriminate against on -- interstate commerce as unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.468" offset="3265285">Why has this issue not reached the State -- this Court before?</text>
            <text syncTime="794.086" offset="3279705">The reason is simple, wherever it was raised before it's been decided for the taxpayer at a lower level.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.030" offset="3299453">In Ohio and North Dakota, it's been ruled administratively that since labor and overhead are excluded from the tax base of the sales tax, the constitution of the United States requires a similar exclusion from the use tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.658" offset="3346056">In California and Oklahoma, the courts have upheld the constitutionality of the use tax carefully interpreting the use tax base to exclude all items excluded from the sales tax base and pointing to the constitutional necessity for so doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.749" offset="3402376">In one case and only one, in Alabama, the issue was squarely raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.208" offset="3420244">It was raised in the isolated sales phase of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.029" offset="3435499">There were five barges that were sold in an isolated sale and the State of Alabama took the position or act as an isolated sale exempted from the sales tax but there's no comparable exemption for the use tax on identical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.921" offset="3483042">Of course that case is not authority for this Court, but we submit that it persuades you because it's intelligently written and we -- we've gone to it at length in our brief and it holds precisely what we have said here in almost towards one (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="871.864" offset="3590875">In that case, the Court said this, as we see it, if the use tax is construed as imposing a tax on the use in the state of tangible personal property purchased outside the State in casual and isolated sales transactions, such tax would constitute an unlawful discrimination against interstate commerce contrary to Commerce Clause of United State Constitution since no similar equivalent tax burden is imposed in connection with the purchase of such property in casual and isolated sales transaction within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.841" offset="3702784">Can it -- continue to quote, "The United States Supreme Court has held that a use tax integrated with a sales tax in amount of some odd hours is not violative of the Commerce Clause when such a system of taxation does not discriminate against transaction in interstate commerce but merely equalizes the burden of taxation on purchases made in the interstate commerce and on strictly local sales", citing Henneford versus Silas Mason Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.251" offset="3796407">However, if such a system of taxation places a discriminatory burden on transactions in interstate commerce which would not apply to local sales, the use tax will become unconstitutional in its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.938" offset="3843114">As the Supreme Court of the United States said in Best versus Maxwell, the Commerce Clause forbids discrimination where the forthright are ingenious, in each case it is our duty to determine where the statute under attack, whatever its name maybe, well in its practical operation, work discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="964.419" offset="3961083">We of course admit that the constitutional rules applicable to the questions raised by Halliburton had long been settled.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.730" offset="4070275">But before giving into the law itself, I would comment briefly on the stipulation in how this case came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.018" offset="4111444">We of course stipulated how Halliburton operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.474" offset="4125236">They are an interstate operation and they operate with these trucks which they manufacture themselves in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.895" offset="4171003">There's no question, however, that these trucks become a part of the massive property in Louisiana and they admit that of course because they are willing to pay a tax on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.756" offset="4214366">They are saying that they want to pay a tax upon the cost to them of the nuts and bolts and the chassis and the sheet metal that went into creating a highly specialized piece of machinery which is what it was in Louisiana the time that it came in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.146" offset="6399979">So we have the rate and the basis identical and now, we have to look to see if the time is identical and it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.848" offset="6510738">And the use tax is identical because the use tax does not apply into a consumer, brings it in to the State for use or consumption, it is withdrawn from commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.928" offset="6615124">And therefore, we have the sales tax and the use tax with the same rate, the same basis and the same moment of taxation and it applies for component parts or completed items.</text>

            <text syncTime="4612.080" offset="18551724">Let's take the case of the small boy who bought parts for his radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.902" offset="18575026">Let us suppose that he was given $50 for a Christmas present and he went downtown and bought $50 worth of parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.575" offset="18605641">And when he got home with them, he found he couldn't put them together, so he knew a radio mechanic down the street who could and he persuaded his father to advance him $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.739" offset="18658304">And so he went down, he had that radio put together in Louisiana, and he ended up with a cost price of $150.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.857" offset="18698846">He would have paid a sales tax on that $50 worth of parts and he would not have paid a sales tax on the $100 worth of labor and shop overhead, the cost of putting these loose parts together and to assemble the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.430" offset="18757047">Now, suppose for the sake of argument the neighboring State, Mississippi had no sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.861" offset="18778781">And suppose that he did not know in Louisiana a skilled mechanic who could put this particular type of radio together.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.629" offset="18809919">And so he put the parts in the back of his father's station wagon and he drove across the Mississippi line to Biloxi where the skilled mechanic lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.115" offset="18847848">And there, he spent his $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="4688.910" offset="18859029">So now, he has $150 invested in a completive radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.743" offset="18878360">And so they put it in the station wagon and they drive back to Louisiana and at the state line, the collector flags him down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.265" offset="18904482">And they do just that by keeping tab on railroad -- railway express receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.174" offset="18932067">But they flagged him down at the state line and they say, "There, you have a radio and what is your cost price?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.280" offset="18952443">Our cost price is $50 per parts and $100 for labor and overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.590" offset="18973759">So the collector says, "Fine, give me 2% of the cost price of $150."</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.112" offset="19003852">"Oh, but I've already paid it on $50 worth when I bought the parts."</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.441" offset="19021093">"Fine, we'll give you credit for that but we want 2% of this labor and overhead because it was expanded in Mississippi."</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.075" offset="19055679">And the man being acquainted with the Halliburton problem says, "Not so."</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.316" offset="19076681">Had we employed the people to put it together in Louisiana, had there been no element of multi- activity and no element of interstate movement of goods, there would've been no tax on the labor and overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.444" offset="19133106">Surely, multi-state activity and interstate movement of goods should not in and of themselves generate a tax where none existed without that element of interstate movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.627" offset="19177932">Suppose Halliburton in the days before Texas had a sales tax, they've only have one for a few months, suppose they brought their factories and their production shops and nestled them right up against the Louisiana line, put the whitewash fence along the line separating their factory from Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.530" offset="19257448">And suppose just on the other side of that whitewash fence, a competitor setup an identical factory which made the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.332" offset="19288691">Now, Halliburton makes them on the Texas side and imports them into Louisiana for use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.897" offset="19314918">The competitor makes them on the Louisiana side and uses them in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.172" offset="19336025">The labor and shop overhead would not be taxed to the one who operated in Louisiana that is stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.668" offset="19366013">The labor and shop overhead would be taxed under the collector's position here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.797" offset="19398510">That one additional inch or actually the crossing of that imaginary state line there, the infinite point of space that is the line would generate the additional tax in view of what the collector has to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.448" offset="19457128">Now, the reason that there's nothing in the record here with reference to -- no arguments had ever been made before in any court, with reference to these other taxes is because as this Court be judicially notice, here, Halliburton had in this brief tax years, $2,500,000 worth of this type of equipment in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.404" offset="19541034">Halliburton is a major operator in the field of oil well servicing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.450" offset="19561200">It has a massive operation in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.312" offset="19572590">And as this Court may judicially notice, there would be many thousands of dollars, hundred to thousands of dollars in one form or another derived over the general taxes which would apply to such a massively operating domesticated board corporation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin B. Taylor, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="4890.042" offset="19663496">I don't think there's any difference there at all Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.107" offset="19675826">The argument is -- and I would say that apparently opposing counsel doesn't think so either since that argument has never been advanced at any part of this case until he was mentioned in this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.137" offset="19731937">In our anxiety to get to each point of the case, we have failed to point out what appears to be the collector's major argument in his brief that what appears to be the major ground for the Louisiana Supreme Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.883" offset="19818872">How do the Louisiana authorities try to justify their flagrant tax discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.898" offset="19846980">Shaken down to its tests, we submit that it is simply this and we quote from the collector's brief, "The tax," he says, "Is not upon interstate commerce or is it upon the privilege of use after commerce is at an end."</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.010" offset="19903404">This is his primary contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.508" offset="19909360">He repeats it in the last paragraph of his brief, "The use tax is imposed for one reason only because the property had become a part of the massive property in the State", and the Louisiana Supreme Court has adopted that as its major premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.173" offset="19972054">He -- its concluding language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.729" offset="19978324">We conclude that the Louisiana use tax does not infringe upon interstate commerce because the tax matter had definitely come vested in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.433" offset="20017089">And they quote the Silas – from the Silas Mason case this language, "The tax is not upon the operation of interstate commerce but upon the privilege of use after commerce is an end."</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.754" offset="20058363">But they do not quote Mr. Justice Cardozo's concluding language which is as follows, "With reference to good move in interstate commerce, they may be subjected", he says, "Once they are at rest to a non-discriminatory tax upon use of the majority."</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.836" offset="20122728">Of course, Mr. Justice Cardozo's words that commerce is at an end cannot be used to justify discriminatory taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.892" offset="20158986">Now, this is not discrimination against interstate commerce because commerce is at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.073" offset="20183646">We respectfully submit that this is arbitrary and discriminatory classification for tax purposes, separate discriminatory classification, separate and heavier tax treatment being base solely upon the history of there having been an interstate movement of goods, no matter how thin the argument is sliced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.130" offset="20259924">Louisiana is still demanding in both faces of this case tax money which it would not demand if there were no element of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.425" offset="20289076">Eliminate interstate commerce, both face result no taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.749" offset="20306317">Add interstate commerce, both faces result taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.838" offset="20322722">If the collector argues and this appears to be his number two position and we quote that the tax operates alike upon all persons and property similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.326" offset="20360652">Let us examine this "tax classification."</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.789" offset="20378520">Classification A of the collector, to be taxed for heavily those who operate in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5075.401" offset="20404955">Classification B, to be taxed likely or not at all those who operate wholly within the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.460" offset="20433168">As classification A taxpayers, interstate operators are all similarly situated says the collector and they're all taxed heavily.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.433" offset="20469112">Classification B taxpayers, intrastate operators were all similarly situated and they're all taxed more lightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.265" offset="20504430">Now, it would seem to us that where the test for taxation is the existence or non-existence of interstate commerce and the Interstate Commerce Clause as the governing principle, we therefore would base Halliburton's conclusion of unconstitutionality upon the Interstate Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.063" offset="20583633">Nevertheless, quite aside from the Interstate Commerce Clause, we submit that this is the case of growth discrimination of arbitrary classification which is forbidden by the equal protection of the Laws Clause and the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.448" offset="20641207">Assume arguendo that Halliburton was -- were an intrastate operator sitting side-by-side in Louisiana with another intrastate operator, a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.022" offset="20683421">And assume that Halliburton was being taxed three times as much as that competitor or more accurately being taxed upon a pace which is tax exempt to that competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.495" offset="20721351">We submit that there's simply no excuse in law for such discrimination even if there were no element of interstate commerce and a fortiori, the tax discrimination cannot be valid where the -- it's only test for taxation is the presence and absence of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.364" offset="20796792">It seems to us that both the facts and the law are simple and clear cut on both phases of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.088" offset="20819675">First phase, labor and overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.078" offset="20827721">Facts, Halliburton manufactured outside of Louisiana and Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.183" offset="20844126">Second, Halliburton transported in the channels of interstate commerce and used in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.336" offset="20864711">Law, movement of goods in interstate commerce ought not in and of itself generated 2% tax on labor and shop overhead which would not had been liberty of no movement to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.809" offset="20910582">Second phase, isolated sales, facts, Halliburton purchased outside Louisiana, in New York and Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.180" offset="20940048">Two, Halliburton transported in the channels of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.323" offset="20956662">Three, Halliburton used in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5215.861" offset="20966797">Law, interstate movement of goods by Halliburton and movement of goods in interstate commerce by Halliburton ought not in and of itself generated 2% tax on the transaction, 2% of cost price of the casual sale which would not have existed at all if there were no element of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.244" offset="21040358">Now, Louisiana could avoid tax discrimination here in one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.109" offset="21075780">Louisiana could add to the tax base of the intrastate business so as to equalize it with the interstate tax -- the interstate state business' taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.758" offset="21118412">For example, labor and overhead could be taxed where it performed in Louisiana as well as where it performed outside Louisiana or the isolated sales exemption could be limited -- could be eliminated as to intrastate sales thus equalize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.540" offset="21177553">Louisiana will not follow this path.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.708" offset="21186226">The alternative path is the only one left as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.189" offset="21200123">Louisiana can and we submit must eliminate these items from the tax base of the interstate operator as well as the intrastate operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.175" offset="21240038">Either method would abolish the inequity, the discrimination which complaint is here has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.273" offset="21264488">But what Louisiana cannot constitutionally do is to include in the tax base of the multi-state operator, the intrastate business concerned, a substantial element while excluding that same substantial element from the tax base of intrastate business whose activities are exactly the same except for the presence or absence of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.936" offset="21379114">Is there any another question that any member of the Court would like to ask as we close?</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.078" offset="21407640">We respectfully submit that the decision below should be reversed.</text>
