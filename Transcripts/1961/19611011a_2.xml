            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="33.299" offset="238592">And what was the Government's objection?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_r_davis" startTime="35.224" stopTime="321.484">
            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="35.224" offset="246324">The Government objected it was beyond the scope of the action and if the Court please, there is additional reason for the Government's having objected which I wanted to bring out exactly at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.799" offset="292613">Under the general prodding I must say of Mr. Justice Whittaker, I should point out that we went through a pretrial procedure in this case pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and as I think Mr. Justice Brennan is well aware, that Rule explicitly provides for amending the pleadings to correct earlier errors and as does Rule 15 of course also provides for amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.157" offset="414030">But what is important about Rule 15 which relates specifically to amendment is that it provides that any amendment which is accomplished relates back to the original pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.030" offset="469514">In other words, the Rule says in just about so many words, the pleading as it is amended shall be deemed a pleading which was originally before the court so that the excessive zeal which I exhibited in drawing this prayer was cured by virtue of the explicit terms of Rule 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.580" offset="571705">And on that ground, in addition to the inherent ground that it was beyond the scope of the action per se, but on the ground of the pretrial stipulation as well, the Government rightly objected to any additional ancillary relief being granted in Judge Jertberg's order, and Judge Jertberg correctly refused me the additional ancillary relief which I sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.236" offset="690406">Therefore Your Honor, I submit that under Rules 15 and 16, the Court correctly proceeded and what is more important, the correction that it made and in -- contained in its final judgment was a correction which by virtue of Rule 15 related back to the original pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.372" offset="798866">I have returned again today to take up the additional time of the Court because we did not reach at all the -- neither Mr. Davis nor myself reached at all the ultimate question, the constitutional question and in any time I take up, I realize that it has been many times argued here and argued by men of far greater experience and wisdom than I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.366" offset="914850">Nonetheless, perhaps the Mendoza case is destined to be the bellwether case and it would be improper for me not at least to make some brief contentions on the basic question of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.021" offset="985485">Without rehearsing the briefs, I would like to invite the Court's attention to one specific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.543" offset="1019549">It is possible on one theory or another with a very sharp knife to divide Trop versus Dulles from Mendoza.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.356" offset="1066883">But there is one basis on which it cannot be divided and that is the question of whether it would be possible to say that in Mendoza, there is no punishment involved whereas in Trop, 401 (g), there is punishment involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.911" offset="1153087">That I submit is an indefensible distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.371" offset="1170954">Every bit of the legislative history of this statute originating as it did with the Attorney General and proceeding through legislative argument in the citations that we have given to the Court shows that it is plainly coercive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.301" offset="1250576">And this I submit is a pivotal question because if it is punitive, if Section 401 (j) is a punitive statute, I submit that it plainly violates procedural due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.528" offset="1319539">And this is of crucial importance because of the often repeated inclination or in the determination of this Court not to limit or affect the power of Congress if it can conceivably be avoided.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.320" offset="2518664">Perez says as Savorgnan said that the standard must be objective, the petitioner will not be hurt to come into court and say, “Well, I didn't really mean to do that” and there's a lot of sound ground for that Mr. Justice Stewart because suppose the Act were a voluntary signing of a pledge of allegiance to the British flag and then the petitioner later came in and said, “Well, I didn't know what I was doing,” the Government is entitled to count on certain acts as manifesting a desire to change allegiance.</text>

            <text syncTime="888.119" offset="3657916">Your Honor, I would submit this and this was a matter which was specially considered this time on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.302" offset="3682680">The results of that consideration appear in a very careful language of Judge Jertberg in the specific finding on the subject in which he finds in essence that the petitioner is a citizen of Mexico according to the laws and Constitution of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.952" offset="3765227">What is citizenship in Mexico if the Court please?</text>
            <text syncTime="918.227" offset="3778288">What is citizenship in Bulgaria or in Hungary or in Russia or wherever?</text>
            <text syncTime="925.158" offset="3806083">Citizenship here, we understand and certainly when the Court has written the final chapter of this series of cases, we're going to know more about what citizenship is, but we have a pretty good idea that it means basic protections, basic protections of American rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.158" offset="3882047">But, when we say that a man is a citizen of Mexico, he may be persona non grata for any number of reasons which are beyond the knowledge or can of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.188" offset="3926141">Citizenship when it's extended to a foreign land means less than nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.218" offset="3946308">It can't equally be cruel and unusual punishment to send for example a man to Bulgaria behind the iron curtain, even though according to the Constitution of Bulgaria, he's a citizen of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.004" offset="4021436">To make the distinction upon that basis Your Honor is to presuppose that citizenship in each foreign land is what citizenship is here and I don't think the Court knows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.460" offset="4075248">In fact, I think the Court more than that can take judicial notice of the fact that such is very, very far from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.018" offset="4109521">He will be set adrift just as surely as well as the Court because Mexico may declare him for any number of its own reasons to be persona non grata.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.386" offset="4170961">And I can inform the Court for the record, if the Court will indulge me that long ago we received a letter from the Mexican consul on our inquiry that he was not welcome in Mexico because he had insisted on relying on his American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.261" offset="4242432">It can't be before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.188" offset="4250164">A Mexican consul can't speak for the Mexican Government and I don't think that the Secretary of State or whoever appropriate officer might make such a statement and Mexico would make it but it has been made.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="1098.119" offset="4497910">Well, first of all, Mr. Justice Whittaker, we know that in fact it was not, that this emerged from the Attorney General's office as an additional penal sanction for the purpose of assisting United States Attorneys and incidentally the amicus curiae brief of the American Civil Liberties Union brilliantly develops this history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.545" offset="4591637">We know that in fact it wasn't, but even if we didn't know where the statute came from or what its source was and how it was administered, nonetheless, I would submit that Congress, and I say this naturally with deference and respect, would have been indulging in a sophistry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.973" offset="4673348">A tax evader or a bank robber who goes across the border is doing the same thing to avoid this kind of sanction and the third answer Your Honor is how can we say this now of Mendoza when the Court refused to say it in Trop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.065" offset="4753701">Here was a man who had taken his oath, who was in military service, who was in a combat zone and who then deserted and the Court refused to uphold the constitutionality there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.594" offset="4811797">Now, how can we turn to a man who has not yet taken that oath and I hope everything I say here carries with it no implied suggestion that this was not a seriously criminal act, I have -- I said this earlier in 1959 to Mr. Justice Frankfurter in response to his questioning, certainly this is a dastardly despicable reprehensible criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.425" offset="4927154">Those of us who are defending this and defending it so hard or doing so because we believe that it's an infringement upon a constitutional right, but getting back into my third point, Mr. Justice Whittaker we could not say that Congress could have made such a statute in Mendoza and upholding on that basis after this Court has held that Congress could not have done it in Trop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.765" offset="5048466">Because of course in Trop they didn't contain that language of deemed to have voluntary relinquished his citizenship, but hypothesizing, we could hypothesize in Trop, but this the Court refused to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.693" offset="5124221">And in a five to four decision, it struck down the constitutionality of the deserter who had taken the oath of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.946" offset="5173227">To make this distinction now, if the Court please, without deluding my previous contentions would be to reverse Trop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.813" offset="5224636">I'm virtually at the end of my time and I'd like to reach entirely across for just a moment all of the considerations which are so magnificently set forth in the amicus curiae brief of the American Civil Liberties Union, I couldn't have written that brief if I have worked on it for 50 years and I'm deeply grateful that it was filed on behalf of my client, but reaching across all of the things that have been raised, I would like to ask this Court for a moment to consider the question of ultimate power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.148" offset="5381998">The Chief Justice speaking in Trop expressed the feeling that this question was perhaps behind us now because of Perez, that is to say that it is now behind us whether Congress in certain circumstances has the power to take away citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.220" offset="5462350">And of course, to the extent that Perez does that, I'm not entitled to speak on the subject at this point, but if I was correct in my earlier assertions that Perez is a regulated statute that is that there was a proper exercise of sovereignty to allow the United States to separate the sheep from the goats, there remains before this Court the question of whether Congress per se as a penal sanction has the power under any circumstances no matter how the statute is drafted to take away citizenship and I submit to the Court that it would be proper here to reach that question and to hold that Congress does not have that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.898" offset="5665061">And this is why I say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.505" offset="5683451">Citizenship is the status which allows the governed to contract with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.353" offset="5722843">Citizenship was explicitly recognized in our sister French Revolution as being the status which all of the freed people attained and the status by which they entered into their -- to the great contract with their new government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.597" offset="5799852">Here, it was so assumed to be the case because of the tradition of British subjects that we never said it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.648" offset="5836006">And I submit that it needs saying now that the Court should hold as inviolable the status of citizenship because it is the status by which the governed contract to enter into government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.879" offset="5908940">That is to say it is the source from which the Constitution arose and if this Court should hold that Congress may not infringe upon that status because it is infringing upon the contractual status of the other party, of the people.</text>
