            <text syncTime="32.278" offset="232469">This case arises from the application of Section 301 of Title 24 of the D.C. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.275" offset="260472">The statutory provision in question provides for the mandatory commitment to a public mental hospital of all those, and I quote the statutory language, “acquitted solely on the ground that they were insane at the time of the commission of the act charged in the information or indictment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="59.773" offset="342497">The petitioner, Coronel Lynch is an inmate of St. Elizabeths Hospital as a result of a commitment pursuant to the statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.259" offset="384397">Yet, the petitioner is not an ordinary beneficiary of an insanity acquittal, as these terms have been traditionally understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.888" offset="418879">The petitioner is an inmate of St. Elizabeths Hospital as the result of an imposition upon him of an insanity defense which he resisted by every legal means at his disposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.974" offset="475303">The petitioner in brief was compelled to submit to an insanity defense, the successful advancement of which was calculated to and did in fact result to his incarceration in a lunatic asylum.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.560" offset="641651">The petitioner had no lawyer and may I say this, the petitioner who had never before been convicted of a criminal offense and who previously served honorably as a commissioned officer in the Armed Forces was charged with a violation of the Bad Check Law of the District of Columbia.This took place on November 6, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.191" offset="720123">Specifically, the petitioner was charged with overdrawing his checking account by $100 and failing to make restitution within a period of five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.285" offset="760560">And now, if it please the Court, he was arraigned before the municipal court and he lacked assistance of counsel at the time of his arraignment and it was at that time that a not guilty plea was entered for the petitioner by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.403" offset="820955">And it was at that time, if it please the Court, that petitioner was committed to the D.C.

            <text syncTime="727.788" offset="3014510">Now, on December 4, 1959, that hospital reported to the court that petitioner was of unsound mind and mentally incompetent to participate in his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.092" offset="3067695">Some time elapsed after that, approximately three weeks, and the hospital then reported a change in the petitioner's mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.427" offset="3101132">It reported that petitioner had sufficiently recovered to be capable of participating in his own defense, but that he had been suffering from a mental disease at the time of the crimes charged in the information and that the crimes if any, were probably the products of said disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.808" offset="3190575">I say “probably,” if Your Honors please, because there was no statement of certainty within the diagnostic view propounded by the Government's psychiatrist as reflected in his letter to the municipal court reproduced on page 26 of the transcript of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.434" offset="3257135">The psychiatrist informed the municipal court in that letter that petitioner was suffering from a manic depressive psychosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.086" offset="3291721">However, the causal relationship between that disease and the criminal act set forth in the indictment was described in less than categorically unqualified terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="828.542" offset="3417527">Now, it was on the basis of this certification that petitioner was brought before the municipal court again on December 29 as competent to stand trial upon the charges then pending against him, and he was then represented by counsel appointed by the municipal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.964" offset="3499238">Petitioner thereupon, acting through counsel, insistently and consistently sought to affect the withdrawal of the not guilty plea which had been entered for him and enter a guilty plea in its stead.</text>

            <label>Mr. Burke Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="3669.968" offset="14783195">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.100" offset="14803780">There are a number of issues that are raised in the brief by Mr. Arens' argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.352" offset="14832828">I would like to separate them into two categories because I think that they will be easier to deal with in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.339" offset="14872743">One category has to do with the trial court's conduct, what the Chief Justice just referred to as the claimed procedural irregularities in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.674" offset="14922062">These issues have been put by Mr. Arens largely in constitutional terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.438" offset="14957171">But I think that the fact is that many or most of them are not necessarily constitutional, that is that the Court could deal with them in the matter of administering federal judicial system and the system of justice in the federal courts without giving them a constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.010" offset="15051421">The other issues have to do with the constitutionality of the statute and these are necessarily constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.646" offset="15089977">They depend -- they turn on the question of whether Congress acted so irrationally in passing the mandatory commitment statute in the district that the statute has to be declared unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.707" offset="15166151">Now, turning first to the procedural side of the case, I think it should be kept in mind that there is no question but that this procedure against Mr. Lynch started with the commission of two criminal acts.</text>
