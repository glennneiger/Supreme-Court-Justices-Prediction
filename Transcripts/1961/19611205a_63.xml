            <text syncTime="14.631" offset="161938">At the time of adjournment yesterday, it was manifest to counsel that apparently because of his own inaptness or perhaps too great of -- familiarity with the problem that he had failed to state to the court in a clear and distinct manner his position in this case, in connection with his motion to dismiss, counsel had stated that he thought it was a simple question perhaps because he deals with it quite daily and day in and day out and quite often in fact twice more this week, so with the Court's permission in a few minutes remaining, I'll try to present it, perhaps, I hope a little bit more clear than I -- clearly than I did yesterday.</text>

            <text syncTime="70.432" offset="385128">It is the respondent's position that the petitioner in his petition for writ of habeas corpus failed to state sufficient factual grounds to justify the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond in issuing a writ of habeas corpus for a hearing returnable to the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond wherein the previous judicial proceeding took place of which the petitioner complained.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.396" offset="488991">This is because the petitioner failed to state in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus that when he requested counsel at the time of his recidivist proceedings that he was indigent at that particular point.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.621" offset="565896">Now, the only thing which is before this Court for its consideration is this record which contains the petition for the writ of habeas corpus in two exhibits appended thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.360" offset="616782">That is the only thing that this Court has to rule upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.833" offset="634755">An examination of the petition reveals that there is a bare allegation that this man was denied counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.769" offset="666415">There are no other facts alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.261" offset="676446">He does not contend he was indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.313" offset="684596">He does not contend that he was denied any federal constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.145" offset="703927">He does not contend that he was unfamiliar with court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.321" offset="716675">He does not suggest anything in connection with the proceeding that counsel could have done for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.509" offset="741439">He does not allege that any of his previous convictions were unlawful or illegal or constitutionally invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.928" offset="771114">Indeed, in fact, he'd meant before this -- been through this proceeding once before as a second time offender in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.766" offset="806431">Now, on that bare allegation, it is our position that he has failed to state a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.141" offset="831927">My learned friend, Professor Meador, has suggested in his reply brief that it is unnecessary for the petitioner to avert facts in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.089" offset="883754">This is contrary to Virginia law as I pointed out yesterday in connection with Morris versus Smyth which is found on pages 3 and 11 our -- of our brief and Penn versus Smith which is found on page 12 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.811" offset="934640">In both of these cases, the Court said that the petitioner must state facts to the respond -- the petitioner rather in this Court has suggested that under Tomkins versus Missouri, and Williams versus Kaiser, that it is unnecessary for the petitioner to state that he was indigent at the time he requested counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.895" offset="1022934">An examination of the opinion of this Court in those cases, opinions rather, reveals that the rule in Missouri is and it has been so stated by these highest court in the State of Missouri that if a man alleges that he was tried without counsel or was denied counsel, the highest court in that state has held that it will assume, that it will assume that he was indigent at the time he requested counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.546" offset="1141530">There is no such rule in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.547" offset="1149576">There is no case that says this in Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.682" offset="1274128">That's exactly it.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.826" offset="1278725">It not only turns on that ground, on a state ground, but I know of no federal case and there may be many that I have not found, but I know of no federal case that says that you can come in and say, “Now, judge, I want a lawyer appointed for me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="310.058" offset="1343613">I know of none.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.769" offset="1350405">You've got to state that you're indigent first.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.418" offset="1365034">Now, there may be a limited number of situations as you Mr. Chief Justice pointed out during the course of my argument in Newsom case where a man has plenty of money, but can't get a lawyer but that is not applicable to this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.705" offset="1426160">We are suggesting sir that the petition on its face even in this Court fails to allege sufficient grounds.</text>
