Eastman on this form of rail rate competition with water carriers which shows that -- about what it is, a means of financing lower rail rate competition with water carriers by revenue -- rail revenue derived from none water competitive rail transportation, both with respect to the short-haul rate and the great reservoir of non-competitive traffic which the railroads have generally, and to -- yes sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="61.731" offset="350333">And may I refer directly to that having said what I have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.397" offset="373008">The Solicitor General’s concession is put in a form which is confusingly broader than any issue that is presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.799" offset="466526">Let me lead up to that if I may, I referred to the fact that after insisting in the lower court on the validity of the Commission's procedures in all respects, both with respect to the necessity of findings and also with respect to the necessity of hearings before on a contested issue or uncontested issues, a binding order is made without giving the hearing that the Commission admitted the needs because it orders one -- insisted in the lower court on the validity of its procedures on both those points, then the Solicitor General concedes that as to the necessity of findings -- it, the Commissioner, has for some years been following a practice which is contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.535" offset="689507">That admission is made in very broad terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.140" offset="723884">But the insistencies that there should be no consideration as to whether the Commission has not also been following a procedure for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.977" offset="791280">Some few years last past that is contrary to law with respect to the necessity of those hearings in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.214" offset="848227">It is in these circumstances that we urge that findings are necessary and that hearings are necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.339" offset="912697">He conceded only that findings were necessary, and asked that this Court not even consider whether the Commission had not also been departing from legally required procedures with respect to the necessity of hearings.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.509" offset="1005380">He does not concede it.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.724" offset="1034219">As a matter of fact he asked this Court not to pass on that point, but to allow the Commission to proceed without review on the short-term orders which have so long escaped preview by the means that I described yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.853" offset="1110810">Changing the situation when the immediate practice -- immediate instance of the unlawful practice is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.541" offset="1149576">That is the essence of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.554" offset="1161592">It is the recurrent nature of these illegalities in short-term orders escaping review that makes it necessary for that to be a review here against the contention that there is no longer any controversy because the particular instance of the unlawful practices (a) findings -- no findings, (b) no hearing has lapsed by virtue of something engineered for the railroad defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.736" offset="1302340">This Court said in the Southern Pacific Terminal cases, I cannot put my argument in better language than that of the Court in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.621" offset="1337866">The questions involved in orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission now usually continuing as are manifestly those in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.751" offset="1378408">And their consideration ought not to be as they might be defeated by short-term orders capable of repetition, yet evading review, that at one time the Government and in another time the carriers, have their right determined by the Commission without a chance of regress.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.327" offset="1472658">There was a situation in which the order before the Commission, had order of the Commission had expired by its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.426" offset="1505050">It had been entered for two years only, and the two years were up and the argument of the Commission was there as yet, but the case was moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.061" offset="1539636">That was the answer that this Court returned in a situation of short-term orders that goes straight to the circumstances of this existing continuing controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.945" offset="1607137">On that case, as I understand it and the ones like it go to the question of mootness, but if you get over that and reach the merits, then does not the Solicitor General practically concede your position on the merits?</text>

            <text syncTime="396.128" offset="1687907">It seems to me that to say that the findings of fact are necessary and yet, that it is not necessary to hold the hearing which the Commission admittedly the needs to make those findings which are to be decisive of its action, before it takes action, binding action, action that can't be collaterally attacked that continues for years, although it's called temporary while the hearings are postponed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward B. Hayes</label>
            <text syncTime="439.401" offset="1860942">Thank you for raising that.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.676" offset="1870033">Let me urge the point that I have made in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.371" offset="1892812">These so-called temporary orders are the diametrical opposite of the relief traditionally granted by Chancery to maintain the status quo pending the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.383" offset="1952893">These so-called temporary orders changed the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.214" offset="1984240">At once before the hearing by a determination on findings now admitted to be necessary are precisely the issues on which any such binding order, changing status quo, injury and immediate injury of one of the parties would have to depend.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.923" offset="2075042">It's hard to concede how anyone could defend that kind of a practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.832" offset="2102732">It is just reminiscent of the famous trial in Lewis Carroll's satire which the order of procedure was, “Sentence first, verdict afterwards.”</text>
            <text syncTime="514.054" offset="2159574">It turns it upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.768" offset="2170441">No one would imagine that when the Commission goes to Congress and says, “We always give a man a hearing if he has a proper interest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="526.263" offset="2208475">What they mean is that they dispose off his interests right at the outset merely on pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.871" offset="2238882">And then so far as the facts are concerned, the hearing is long postponed.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.674" offset="2274095">And the results of the Government says sometimes, “In a change of the order which had forced those issues apparently when the case was first submitted on the pleadings.”</text>
            <text syncTime="559.493" offset="2341386">Now, I say the Government's concession with respect to the necessity of those findings rarely carries with it a concession of the necessity of having a hearings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3439.035" offset="13859506">And that would be the theory of the damage suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.269" offset="13868492">Now let me just say this on the damage suit, a point has been raised but the question as to the effect of the Commission's order on any claim for damages is an issue that we think can be fully litigated in the damage suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.176" offset="13956054">And I might mentioned that the issue of the damage suit goes to the question of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.716" offset="13970265">Now, this Court has frequently held that you cannot collaterally attack an order of the Commission in a private suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.361" offset="14004851">And the theory of those cases is that under the statute, the only way you can seek such review is by a proceeding broad and a three-judge District Court against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.069" offset="14047692">Now, we think that an exception that perhaps properly be made in the narrow case where a proceeding is brought to get such relief but the case becomes moot before there is any decision, because in that situation if you say that the order cannot be collaterally attacked in the damage suit, there is no way to challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.484" offset="14145285">But we think that in a sense of the question of whether the chicken or the egg came first, you might say the case is not moot because you have to determine that alternately, you could say, it can be determined in a private suit because the case is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.527" offset="14205471">And we think the latter is the preferable practice because the possibility of this damage suit, what the issues are, the theory of it are all wholly conjectural and we think that to allow life to be breathed in to a controversy otherwise dead because of the possible -- possibility that the issue may be raised in a damage suit is not enough to cause a deviation from the traditional --</text>

            <text syncTime="4738.431" offset="19057142">Either to reduce the rates at the intermediate points, the local rates from Chicago to the East, or to seek Fourth Section relief to maintain the high rates of the intermediate points and permit the combination of the rail rate in the Chicago and the reshipping rate out of Chicago to apply to this traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.855" offset="19146794">What the railroads did elect to do was to secure Fourth Section relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.451" offset="19169155">Their application was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.875" offset="19174902">All interested parties including the appellants here did file, did have the opportunity and did file protests.</text>

            <text syncTime="4779.894" offset="19222967">Now, as a result of the relief granted, the Eastern railroads were able to charge the same for their service from Chicago to the East whether the traffic arrived by barge or grain or rail at Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.754" offset="19290363">It should be noted that the same result here could've been reached by reducing the lower rates from Chicago -- by reducing the short-haul rates applicable from Chicago to the East.</text>
            <text syncTime="4807.633" offset="19333935">Now in fact, this is what was ultimately done in March of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.266" offset="19368417">The railroads at that time reduced the short-haul rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.663" offset="19397987">By this reduction, any violation or departure from the long and short-haul clause was removed and any relief which the railroads had been granted under the Fourth Section orders here involved, expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.236" offset="19468309">The appellants here have asserted that the reductions in the short-haul rates, that is the rates from Chicago and Indiana points was done solely or was done for the purpose of avoiding a judicial determination of validity of the orders in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6716.366" offset="26968795">And as pointed out from the bench on the other point, the necessity of hearings, that is question B in this case, just as much this case as the question of the necessity of findings.</text>
