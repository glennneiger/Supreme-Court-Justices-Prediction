            <text syncTime="1629.902" offset="6622960">The Court had before it habeas corpus application which sought release from a life sentence to the penitentiary, under the habitual criminal law, on the ground that one of the prior sentences had not been to a penitentiary, but had been to a jail, and the facts in that case maybe of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.926" offset="6699029">Johnson had pleaded not guilty to a charge of malicious wounding and the he changed it to a plea of guilty to a charge of unlawful wounding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.590" offset="6741765">Again, he pleaded not guilty to a charge of malicious wounding and then he pleaded guilty to the lesser crime of unlawful wound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.037" offset="6779486">This time, the second offense, he reached an understanding with the prosecutor attorney in the County that he would be sent not to pen -- the penitentiary, but he would be sent to the county jail for six months and he would be fined $50.00 and it happened the 13th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.127" offset="6847927">Johnson was once more indicted from murder and this time, the recidivist statute was invoked on the ground that he had been subject to a sentence of -- he was subject to crimes punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, because he could have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.708" offset="6926190">He could have been sent to the penitentiary in both cases for unlawful wounding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.446" offset="6957119">The West Virginia Court had the same statute before it that we have here today and it held that despite the fact that he was sent to jail, the Court would look to Section 18 which speaks of punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary and not to Section 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.930" offset="7043114">It would not regard Section 19 as interpretive of -- of Section 18.</text>

            <text syncTime="1748.911" offset="7099016">The Court clearly says there's not doubt about it that the substantive provisions of the West Virginia law are contained in Section 18 that the adjective provisions, the procedural provisions are contained in Section 19.</text>

            <text syncTime="1819.416" offset="7381034">The Court held in that case that notice was not required.</text>
