            <text syncTime="1032.730" offset="4234324">Now, these statements of these jurors would support the argument, that publicity from the Senate hearings just did not have such an inflammatory effect on the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.327" offset="4280717">And further, to examine the jurors who were excused for prejudice would indicate that also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.848" offset="4306735">There were a number of them excused from prejudice arising out of the Senate hearings, but there were four who were excused for prejudice -- from other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.961" offset="4355218">Juror Loot said at Record 63 thought he should be excused because of great labor relations between Boeing Airplane Company and the Teamster Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.131" offset="4399940">Juror Brown at Record 168 to 169 stated he had prejudice towards Beck which arose over a period of years, but it was not from anything in the McClellan hearings, and he didn't think he could be impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.947" offset="4463156">There was Juror Myers at the Record 198 to 200. He said he was biased because of his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.535" offset="4493563">He employs truck drivers who were Teamster Union members and there was Juror Sanderson at Record 207 who said he was biased dating back to 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.471" offset="4541210">Now, this illustrates of course all the more reason why the continuance not -- should not have been granted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.470" offset="4573288">Dave Beck was a very prominent and a controversial figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.215" offset="4592201">He was a labor leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.646" offset="4597948">He admittedly had done a great deal toward securing many concessions, many benefits for the Teamsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.038" offset="4623548">He actually stepped on a lot of toes particularly in the area of businessmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.109" offset="4647790">Almost anything he did at anytime was news.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.361" offset="4660851">There was just no probability or likelihood that any publicity about him would die down in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.586" offset="4693765">The proper thing to do in such a case is not to postpone this indefinitely or change the venue to another place equally exaggerated as it's called, but the thing to do is take the practical approach, find out if in fact a fair jury can be obtained and in this case, this record pretty conclusively shows that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.134" offset="4775894">Now, the petitioner argues that when there is too much publicity or a great deal of publicity, the jurors' answers cannot be relied on in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.169" offset="4824064">Petitioner argues from cases containing similar language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.717" offset="4842245">Now, I think petitioner's argument misses the whole point of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.467" offset="4865233">The most recent I believe from this Court is Irvin against Dowd in 366 U.S. reports I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.423" offset="4909014">In that case, I think it was over 90% of the jurors examined had a preconceived opinion as to guilt or innocence, but said they felt they could set that opinion aside and decide the case on the evidence produced in court and it was held that in the set of circumstances presented there that the jurors' answers that they could set aside their opinion could not be relied upon because they subconsciously would not be able to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.458" offset="5037223">That is entirely different from jurors who do not have an opinion, who have no bias and say they can act fairly and impartially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.562" offset="5073586">There was no basis whatsoever for saying you cannot rely on those jurors' answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.210" offset="5112247">And also in regard to the voir dire examination, in the Irvin against Dowd case, it was -- the test was reiterated that just because the juror might have some preconceived opinion does not necessarily disqualify him, but to test is whether he can set that aside and decide the case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.563" offset="5197615">Now, in extreme circumstances when almost the entire panel is in such a position and that newspaper coverage is so inflammatory and so widespread, if you have all the jurors saying, I already have an opinion on the guilt, but I can set it aside then you can't rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.388" offset="5268877">In this case though, we did in fact select 12 jurors who had no opinion and in effect in the examination here petitioner was even given two extra peremptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.765" offset="5322480">Juror Cox at Record 71 to 73, he stated in answer to questions by counsel that he had a general prejudice against the petitioner, but it would not affect his fairness in deciding this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.736" offset="5398340">He was excused for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.590" offset="5405759">Now, under the test set out in Irvin against Dowd, he was an acceptable juror and one which counsel should perhaps exercise a peremptory challenge against, but he's not subject to being excused for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.165" offset="5459989">There was at -- Juror Hubbell at the Record 195 to 196 stated he hadn't formed a definite opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.120" offset="5495829">He was little doubtful about whether he had an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.480" offset="5509308">He stated he was sure he could be fair and impartial in this case, but he could understand why Mr. Burdell would have doubt about him because he had heard a lot of publicity and a lot of things and a lot of questions asked and he was excused for cause and he said he was absolutely certain he could be fair and impartial in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.931" offset="5679104">So the examination, the voir dire examination pretty conclusively shows that the trial jurors were fair and impartial and had no preconceived opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.287" offset="5720482">Also, I believe it was the Handy case that set out the test that when this Court is asked to reverse a state court because of a prejudiced jurors that that must be shown to be a demonstrable reality and not a mere opportunity for prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.427" offset="5829047">Now, I would submit that this record is scarcely sufficient to even show the opportunity for prejudice, looking at the newspaper coverage in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.428" offset="5877112">The indictment returned on July 12, in this case, didn't go to trial until December 2nd, it was almost five months, 10 days short to five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.932" offset="5915146">Now, during that time, it was after indictment, after the McClellan hearings in regard the petitioner were all over there was not much publicity about him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.718" offset="5958196">The newspapers were amazingly objective and factual in reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.010" offset="5975437">There was no editorializing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.951" offset="5983169">There was no attempt to try this case in the public prints, and almost the only publicity about this particular case was generated by petitioner himself in his various pretrial maneuvers which he necessarily had to make to protect his record, but still he is a public figure and anything of that sort he does is news.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.787" offset="6062477">Still it wasn't particularly played up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.371" offset="6072822">It was simple report of matters of public record which the petitioner himself had made as matters of public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.459" offset="6101243">Also, there was a considerable amount of publicity about the petitioner's activities in his union affairs, his membership campaign and news conferences he had in regard to these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.119" offset="6143875">There was nothing inflammatory or prejudicial about those, but still again he is a prominent public figure any of these things he does is news, and they're going to be reported.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.793" offset="9226533">There is quite a bit of derogatory publicity surrounding these McClellan hearings and they were called as a direct result of that, I don't think it's disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.652" offset="9266030">To digress on that point for a moment that is an established mode of procedure in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.552" offset="9289540">It is in fact that I'm aware of the only time the grand jury ever is called is for a specific purpose, either to investigate a public official who apparently is doing something wrong or to investigate a case of this sort with the normal procedures are not sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.547" offset="9417540">And the specific reason it's called is just because it can secure these records and can get the evidence and they're always called for a specific purpose such as this one as this case was called.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.382" offset="9464874">Now, the petitioner on one hand claims that the grand jurors should have been examined as to bias toward him on the other hand, he complains that there was a reference made to him and a charge to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.487" offset="9525269">I submit that those positions are inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.149" offset="9555989">Also, in regard to this empanelment of the grand jury, petitioner complains about the charge because it referred to the Senate hearings and this grand jury was called for the specific purpose of investigating officers of the Teamster's Union in regard to misappropriation of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.859" offset="9634774">I failed to see how that can be prejudicial when a standard method of directing grand jury investigations in any situation is to present them with a bill charging somebody with a crime, actually claiming they did commit a crime and asking the grand jury to investigate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.005" offset="9707395">It certainly is far more prejudicial than the method utilized here where the jurors were told at least twice, they are to inquire into these things and determine the truth or falsity of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.835" offset="9750758">And they were sworn to present no person through hatred, envy or malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.438" offset="9781164">There is no indication here that bias or prejudice took any part in bringing these indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.994" offset="9807391">I think it is not controlling of course at least a factor to be considered that the petitioner was convicted before the jury demonstrably fair on the evidence adduced by the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.196" offset="9868204">It was obtained by the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.379" offset="9872906">That was the basis for the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.058" offset="9883564">It'd be hard to find that they did not have sufficient cause to indict when that very evidence is the evidence which convicted petitioner before a jury who was acceptable to both sides.</text>
