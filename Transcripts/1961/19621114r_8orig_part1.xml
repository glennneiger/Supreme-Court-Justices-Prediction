            <label>Mr. Mark Wilmer</label>
            <text syncTime="16.546" offset="169566">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.504" offset="177403">Well, we have been handed by counsel for California a portion of the transcript which is headed uncontradicted testimony of JR Ryder which relates to project deficiencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.801" offset="238529">We are not here to attempt to comb the record nor are we here to make findings which the Master refused to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.069" offset="271653">We simply say so that it will not be assumed that because we have not contested the statement that we ascend to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.109" offset="307806">We simply say that we do not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.332" offset="316688">We simply say that a proper investigation of the testimonial offered would indicate quite to the contrary but I don't think this Court is the place that we should attempt to resolve questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.620" offset="377814">I'd like to briefly, if might, turn to Section 8 (b) again because the reading of that demonstrates to us at least two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.939" offset="427133">I'm not going to read it because it is long but its in substance and briefly provided that the United States, in constructing, managing, and operating the dam reservoir canals and other works, including the appropriation, delivery and use of water for generation of power, irrigation, and other uses shall be subject to and shall conform to the terms of a compact if any between the States of Arizona, California, and Nevada or any two thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.913" offset="567045">Now, that is most unusual language in directing that the Secretary shall conform to a compact made by two of the three states and we think that it requires some searching to find out why that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.258" offset="632456">It then provides, of course, that if the compact is made and approved by the Congress prior to January 1, 1929, that shall govern the Secretary's contracts and that if made subsequent thereto the Secretary's contract shall govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.286" offset="696508">I would say in passing that originally, the period allowed for compact was a year, but apparently in the haste of the closing of this Congress or the holiday season and all, they didn't extend the period because the Act was approved on December 21st and it was, of course, seven or eight days before the period expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.559" offset="781563">What I'm leading to is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.347" offset="792743">The debates in Congress emphasized and made clear one thing, a contest between States' rights and the power of the federal judiciary, the power in the Federal Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.441" offset="849168">All through these debates, the question was not, “Has Congress by this legislation, allocated the water?”</text>
            <text syncTime="194.221" offset="880306">The question was, “Can Congress constitutionally do so?”</text>
            <text syncTime="198.341" offset="896711">And as you have heard before, Senator King at one point said, “I, in effect challenge the right of the federal government to put his mighty hands down upon this river.”</text>
            <text syncTime="208.231" offset="936312">And the other point said, “The States' rights are being destroyed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="212.404" offset="953031">Now, nothing is said in this authorization, this suggestion of a compact which was to govern the Secretary about appropriative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.180" offset="1000051">How do you square the notion, appropriate -- appropriative rights, rights of prior appropriation should survive the compact or should survive the Project Act when nothing is said in here with respect to preserving those rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="237.907" offset="1055013">This is a Carte Blanche authorization to the States to enter into a compact and there's nothing whatever with respect to recognizing appropriative rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.412" offset="1105063">It is also true, however, that the Congress did not undertake itself to make an allocation of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.079" offset="1139649">We think it did and let me -- let me just pursue that on a moment if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.240" offset="1156368">How, if it please the Court, unless Congress had divided the water, could do if the States make a compact?</text>
            <text syncTime="271.237" offset="1188342">In other words, unless the Congress felt that it set apart to each of these States their aliquot part of the water could have authorized two of them to compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.529" offset="1225540">Certainly, it wouldn't be said, if it please the Court, that Arizona and Nevada could compact and cut California out.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.274" offset="1256469">You can't make a division of something unless you own it, unless it's confined to your jurisdiction, and it's within your custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.391" offset="1292936">We say, if it please the Court, that this is another indication that Congress did say they have made an allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.395" offset="1324910">We say that Congress must have thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.296" offset="1336508">They made an allocation as otherwise they couldn't have authorized two of the States to make a compact since in so doing, they had no right to decide how much they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.425" offset="1377050">Now, I expressed that awkwardly, Mr. Justice Harlan but --</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark Wilmer</label>
            <text syncTime="349.923" offset="1503065">Or obviously, it wasn't intended that California and Nevada should get together and cut out Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.427" offset="1525112">So, the Congress must have thought that we have set apart to each one of these three states their proportionate share of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.491" offset="1553324">And they said in the substance, if Arizona and Nevada want to get together and raise the ceiling a little bit, fine, between themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.034" offset="1583522">If Arizona wants to give Nevada 100,000 acres feet, fine!</text>
            <text syncTime="373.560" offset="1597628">If Nevada wants to give Arizona 100,000 acre-feet of the 300, they said that they don't need, fine!</text>
            <text syncTime="379.302" offset="1620616">Or if Arizona, Nevada, and California altogether and get together and in the interest of peace, settle these questions, fine!</text>
            <text syncTime="388.671" offset="1658023">Now let me make one further suggestion, the other reasonable interpretation is, that since Congress have said California may not go beyond 4.4 million that Nevada and Arizona were thereby given the authority from Congress to divide between themselves, the balance of the water which would be the 3 million acre-feet water.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.285" offset="1752482">We say, if it please the Court, that it is impossible to believe that the Congress, no one gets great treasure of water, this thing that has been fought over and, fought over, and fought over for years that this Congress intended to walk away and leave that to the sole discretion of the courts or the interstate compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.486" offset="1837328">Now, if I may just turn briefly to Section 5 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="442.728" offset="1874317">If the Court may kindly examine Section 5 after the provision with respect to water contracts, you will find what?</text>
            <text syncTime="449.709" offset="1902216">You will find that the Secretary was given detailed directions as to how he should handle power.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.148" offset="1927920">He was told that in the event there was conflicting applications, he should have a hearing and he was told what policy he was to apply in that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.337" offset="1960730">He was to apply the policy of Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.140" offset="1971911">Now, can we believe for one minute that the Congress intended to store up this great body of water, this great treasure in the west which is practically, as it has been said an amenity and not a treasure?</text>
            <text syncTime="478.704" offset="2018200">Can we believe for one minute that they intended to store that water in a great reservoir and then do what?</text>
            <text syncTime="484.763" offset="2042441">What was the Secretary to do, unless he was given a direction to conform to 4 (a)?</text>
            <text syncTime="490.744" offset="2066369">What was he to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="491.701" offset="2070131">Was he to wait for the courts to adjudicate it by a lawsuit?</text>
            <text syncTime="495.550" offset="2085595">Was he to hold a hearing with respect to the rights of prior appropriators?</text>
            <text syncTime="499.030" offset="2099493">How was he to do that because Congress gave him no authority to hold a hearing with respect to water rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="503.568" offset="2117674">They did give him the authority told hold a hearing with respect to power applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.816" offset="2134601">So what is he to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="509.091" offset="2139721">Wait another 10-year, Wyoming versus Colorado, litigation period?</text>
            <text syncTime="513.195" offset="2156126">How was he to determine where the waters to go unless 4 (a) told him.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.695" offset="2174203">And we think that the administrative construction which the Secretary of the Interior followed by allocating first off in Arizona 2.8 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.842" offset="2214745">Next allocating to California the 4.4 million in the first priorities and then allocating to Nevada 300,000, implemented and carried out the directions the Congress gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.058" offset="2267617">Now, I would say that again in closing, to me, it is inconceivable that with a treasure far greater than power, far greater than power, that Congress would have advocated its responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.881" offset="2322892">That Congress would have shown this great treasure up for grabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.378" offset="2340864">The Congress would have said despite the fact that this great treasure is needed and required, we're going to store it until what?</text>
            <text syncTime="567.093" offset="2371793">Until the rights of prior appropriators are determined and how are you going to determine those?</text>
            <text syncTime="571.406" offset="2389034">Either by compact which had failed, and failed, and failed or by litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.383" offset="2408887">And as Mr. Taylor said in response to a discussion by Mr. Carter that I read you yesterday, we have in the Upper Basin litigated for 25 years and with very poor results.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.339" offset="2452773">I've always thought that a statute should be given a reasonable interpretation and in the public interest and I therefore say, if it please the Court, in our judgment at least, you cannot reconcile the notion of Congress with detailed precision, spelling out how the power was to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.810" offset="2526647">With detailed precision, saying what the Secretary should do if there was a conflict, and then walking away from 32 million stored acres of water -- acre-feet of water, that to me is inconceivable.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.313" offset="2648586">I would like first to say a word about question of justiciability that occupied a considerable part of the Court's time yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.557" offset="2689651">First, the -- it is clear that there is enough water in the river to satisfy the presently existing uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.825" offset="2754644">But it is also claimed that there is not enough water in the mainstream of the Colorado River to satisfy the fully matured claims based upon past events.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.116" offset="2811800">The exact amount which will be available below Lee Ferry is of course unknown and as the Master found unknowable with any exactitude in the future, so that one is dealing here with something of indefinite and perhaps shifting size.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.563" offset="2889644">But there are certainly no estimates that put the exact amount available after evaporation and channel losses and after satisfying the Mexican treaty in excess of 8 million acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.780" offset="2954533">Now, take the matured claims that already exist or at least are alleged to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.713" offset="2986193">California claims that she is entitled to 5,378,000 acre-feet based upon what she says are existing appropriative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.072" offset="3039692">Arizona claims based on a contract with the Secretary of Interior, 2.8 million, and Nevada claims 300,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.308" offset="3084622">Adding the total of those claims, one gets just under 8,500,000 acre-feet which is in excess of what anyone would say was a reliable amount downstream in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.899" offset="3142928">There's another way of indicating the extent of the clash.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.171" offset="3164035">I made myself a little table which shows how the conflicting theories of the Master in California would work out at two estimates of the available flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.195" offset="3216175">If you take the -- if the available flow is 5,850,000 as suggested by -- as suggested by the California witnesses, I have had these copy then if it would help the Court why the clerk contest if you wouldn't have write it down.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.839" offset="3330696">If the available flow is 5,850,000 then under the California proposal, California would get 4.6 million, Nevada would get 125,500 and Arizona would get 1,129,500.</text>

            <text syncTime="1058.561" offset="4337664">Well, I think that people to some extent are trying to carry water on both shoulders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.829" offset="4370683">I think that the problem there is this, that there may be not enough water for purposes of having a justiciable controversy and there still maybe enough prospects of future water so that we do not have to think of all the Southern Californians as saying their farmland shrivel up or the people of the metropolitan district goes thirsty, because there are in the future various contingencies that may fall in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.903" offset="4506937">Including as Arizona says the possibility is unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.191" offset="4524178">But I think there is an in between point where there is a disaster for Southern California and yet there is a real conflict as to the existing claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.751" offset="4562422">And that's the position which we would think was an accurate description.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.665" offset="4594082">In the Nebraska against Wyoming case, this Court said, “Wyoming against Colorado indicates that where the claims to the water the river exceed the supply, a controversy exists appropriate for judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.266" offset="4652387">And then referring in another passage to that earlier case, there -- there the only showing of injury or threat of injury was the inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all appropriative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.536" offset="4709543">But now here, they aren't all based on appropriative rights, Arizona is based on the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.466" offset="4729187">But it seems to me the same principle applies that the claims based on past amendment exceed the supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.216" offset="4760221">It is important to bear in mind two other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.216" offset="4776208">In the first place, a suit to quiet title will of course lie in the case of water rights as well as in the case of other real estate and this may be thought of as having some of the aspects of a suit to quiet title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.266" offset="4844440">The -- if the Court's concerned with that, I can give two references one is to Kinney on his book on water, second edition, Section 1535; the other is to Wylie, the third edition, Section 654 and an illustration which I think is clear occurred to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.445" offset="4937122">Suppose one had real estate to which there were mortgages with the same amounts as this water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.464" offset="4969200">And you were trying to borrow some money, claiming that the amounts of the alleged liens weren't as large as the claimant say they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.474" offset="5001279">As I understand it, under those circumstances, he could maintain a bill to quiet his title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.138" offset="5023953">Finally, I would remind the court of its decision in Illinois against Wisconsin, when the two little Illinois towns filed an application for -- to determine their right to withdraw water from Lake Michigan, saying that the lake estates denied that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.539" offset="5125517">The bill alleged that the towns couldn't borrow the money to build the plants to draw the water until these claims were adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.944" offset="5163133">The point was argued in full and while the Court wrote no opinion and I suppose it's not definitely decided, nevertheless did grant permission to file the bill between the States so that again points in this same direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.210" offset="5228231">I would emphasize, finally the importance of the clarification here, in two respects: First, this controversy clouds the title and blocks the development of the river; second, from the standpoint of Arizona and who would agree from our standpoint with respect to the Indian reservation, California keeps changing the situation all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.602" offset="5333765">They keep taking more water and then they come in and say, “See, we are entitled to this because we have been using it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.370" offset="5360828">And this in itself seems to me a changing in the situation and affecting of the Arizona and Indian rights, which makes the case sharply justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.145" offset="5415999">Now, on the merits from the standpoint of the United States, this case has two main parts, the apportionment of the mainstream water between Arizona, California and Nevada, and the second, the claims of the United States to water in behalf of the Indian reservations the National Forest Park and the Wildlife Refuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.710" offset="5514219">The mainstream controversy which I will discuss first itself has two principal divisions: First, the so-called limitation issue; and second, the so-called priority or ratability issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.060" offset="5583600">The former question, I think might better be stated a little more broadly by saying that it raises the issue, what's the subject matter to be divided?</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.102" offset="5627800">What is the supply of water with which the Project Act is primarily concerned?</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.755" offset="5650369">Is it all the water in the Lower Basin as California contends?</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.986" offset="5667297">Or is it -- does the Project Act deal primarily within Section 4 (a) only with the mainstream water controlled by the Hoover Dam and related works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.905" offset="5714944">Once that question has been answered then one can go on to the priority or ratability issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.576" offset="5745664">Now, the controversy -- limitation controversy focuses of course on Section 4 (a) of the Project Act and on the first paragraph of Section 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.498" offset="5809403">If the Court wish to refer to it, it appears on page 382 of the Master's Report, which provides that California must accept a limitation that all the water she takes shall not exceed 4.4 million acre-feet of waters, apportioned to the Lower Basin States by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado River Compact plus not more than one-half of any excess or surplus waters unapportioned by said compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.607" offset="5953808">The dispute is over the composition of the universe that Section 4 (a) divides at least, divides in the sense that it says California can have only so much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.444" offset="6009187">California says that she is entitled to remember the 4.4 million out of the 7.5 million acre-feet of all the water in the entire Lower Basin plus the Gila.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.261" offset="6072404">Thus, she is willing to read the compact literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.658" offset="6089958">Because the compact on page 373, rather clearly apportions all the water in the basin but she is unwilling to read literally the words plus not more than one half of any excess or surplus waters unapportioned by said compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.335" offset="6168743">Because the compact says that the waters not apportioned by Article III (a) and (b) shall be held for future apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.312" offset="6208658">And California has to give the words not apportioned here a different meaning than the words unapportioned have in the latter part of the compact itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.807" offset="6250559">The Master agrees as indeed as everyone that these words 4.4 million acre-feet of water is apportioned to Lower Basin States by paragraph 4 (a) of Article III of the Colorado Rivers compact are to be read as referring to the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.976" offset="6343241">There is no doubt about that but he said that the draftsman of the Project Act, acted on the supposition that Article III (a) of the compact, apportioned to the Lower Basin, 7.5 million acre-feet of mainstream water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.921" offset="6427042">The Congress was wrong, the Master said, in that supposition that the compact apportion is to 7.5 million acre-feet out of all the water in the basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.256" offset="6464345">But it's perfectly clear, right or wrong that Congress made that supposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.272" offset="6492453">And then he said the question is -- shall my or the Court's interpretation of the Project Act be governed by the true meaning of the compact or shall it be governed by what Congress clearly suppose was the meaning of the compact and he concluded that the latter meaning of the Project Act was the one that should be followed in order to give effect to the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.331" offset="6608645">We differed from the Master only in one minor respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.265" offset="6632469">It seems to us that it is unnecessary and indeed inappropriate to construe the compact at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.685" offset="6662144">The Upper Basin States are here, Arizona would put a different meaning on the compact than the Master did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.580" offset="6685654">It seems to us that that question doesn't need to be decided because we think that the proper way to interpret Section 4 (a) is to give Article III (a) of the compact, the meaning that Congress suppose it have and that that controls in the interpretation of the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.157" offset="6783979">There are three principal grounds for this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.640" offset="6805922">One is that Congress was dealing what it enacted to Project Act primarily with mainstream waters and one would naturally suppose also not inevitably that the limitations would be written in terms of the mainstream waters with which the project was dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.659" offset="6885961">Second, we find in the second paragraph of Section 4 (a) in support for the Master's reading and our reading that Congress intended to apportion 7.5 million acre-feet of mainstream water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.918" offset="6967045">There are several provisions in the second paragraph, 382 and over on 383 that seem to indicate this to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.760" offset="7002363">The Master mentioned most of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.719" offset="7014275">In the first place, item one, authorizes an agreement which would apportion to Nevada 300,000 acre-feet and to Arizona, 2.8 million acre-feet of the 7.5 million acre-feet annually apportioned to the Lower Basin by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.539" offset="7121481">Now that, if you couple those references of two million eight point three million with the 4.4 million given to California, you would get the whole 7.5 million acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.383" offset="7184906">If that is the whole 7.5 million acre-feet apportioned into the Lower Basin, then one cuts out two Lower Basin States in the -- supposes the Congress wasn't concerned with them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.508" offset="7253452">Again, item two, provides that Arizona may annually use half the surplus of excess and half of the excess or surplus waters unapportioned by the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.479" offset="7321266">The compact itself, reserves the surplus over the 7.5 million feet of basin water, for future apportionment and Congress can hardly be suppose to have said, “Well, Arizona can have half of that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.439" offset="7389080">Especially when they said in the first paragraph of Section 4 (a), California can have half of it too because they would have been taking the whole surplus.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.634" offset="7473925">California says, that means the first million of which was allocated to the Lower Basin, but the only time the contract speak -- the compact speaks of waters unapportioned is in page 374 in item 3F.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.816" offset="7562637">The word speaks of the beneficial equita -- further equitable apportionment of the beneficial use of the waters of the Colorado system unapportioned by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.133" offset="7611956">So there, it speaks as if (a), (b) and perhaps (c) had made some kind of an apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.121" offset="7651871">Finally, Mr. Justice Stewart, and I think most persuasive of all, the second paragraph of Section 4 (a) in item three says and, and this is certainly an additive and, and that the State of Arizona shall have the exclusive beneficial conceptive use of the Gila River and it's territories within the boundaries of said State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.973" offset="7787290">This is in addition to what have gone before or what have gone before then must have been an apportionment of the mainstream water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.059" offset="7827623">It is suggested by California that that's an inappropriate reading that this really aren't conjunctive and that all, that there were some duplication in this that what it said here that Arizona made by this compact get 2.8 million acre-feet out of the Lower Basin's share and then it went on and said that Arizona can have all the Gila as identifying where it's coming from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.659" offset="7942040">Well, that is possibly, grammatically except at the time everybody supposed that the Gila have three and a half million acre-feet in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.294" offset="7972551">And it would be rather silly to say that Arizona can have 2.8 million and she can have exclusively out of the Gila, when the Gila contained 3.5.</text>

            <text syncTime="2190.054" offset="8863640">The reason you require the compact, I think, Justice Douglas, with respect to Gila was because it would deal not only with the apportionment portion of the United States share but with the burden of the Mexican treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.963" offset="8919228">And Congress apparently was not undertaking to prescribe a solution with respect to the burden of the Mexican treaty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2242.210" offset="9072201">Second, as I said, the dispute focused upon the division of the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.281" offset="9100518">And very quickly narrowed to the question whether giving Nevada full of 300,000 acre-feet, should the remaining 7.2 be divided 4.6 to California and 2.6 to Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.896" offset="9163003">Or should it go 4.2 to California and 3 million out of the mainstream to Arizona, and of course the final compromise split the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.577" offset="9209710">Third, everyone who spoke assume that the universe to be divided was 7.5 million acre-feet in the mainstream of the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.082" offset="9263731">And fourth and this is particularly important, I think Justice Douglas, throughout the legislative history, the first and second paragraphs of Section 4 (a), were treated as -- as conjunctive, as fitting together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.753" offset="9322350">Indeed through merely all the debate, they were put together and both were mandatory rather than contingent upon a compact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2345.334" offset="9484727">And while the second part was being the debated that Senator Hiram Johnson came into a colloquy with Senator Hayden of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.555" offset="9525582">Senator Hayden said, “The senator fails to understand that there are two elements in this water controversy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.468" offset="9549197">One is how the seven and a half million acre-feet to be divided in the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.248" offset="9568319">The Senate settled that by vote, California may have 4.4 million acre-feet of the water, it follows logically that if that demand is to be conceded as everybody agrees, the remainder is 2 million acre-feet for Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.757" offset="9626415">That settles there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2404.158" offset="9720038">Now, in the division of water that the Senate saw fit to impose yesterday, Arizona had 2 million acre-feet and 3.5 million acre-feet from the Gila, did not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.379" offset="9772910">This is Senator Johnson of California, and Mr. Hayden said “Yes, correct, making 6,300,000 acre-feet.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.645" offset="10185958">The Master, apparently suppose that his view of the Project Act, in Section 4 (a), compelled him to leave out of account, compel the Secretary to leave out of account, any diversions made from the mainstream above Lake Mead.</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.201" offset="10428165">And I will take the Arizona contract for an illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.796" offset="10450526">Let's suppose being very optimistic, there were eight and a half million acre-feet available in the mainstream below Lee Lake -- below Lee Ferry and from Lake Mead.</text>

            <text syncTime="2628.443" offset="10617187">Now, suppose that Arizona takes a million of the 8,500,000 out above Marble Canyon, now, there would be seven and a half million acre-feet available from Lake Mead.</text>

            <text syncTime="2669.662" offset="10782072">The effect, in other words, on my supposition as to figures would be that Arizona takes California's half of the surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.501" offset="10821360">The disputed clause, if valid, of course prevents this, because the amount taken out above would be charged against what she was entitled to get from Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.182" offset="10872142">We submit that the clause in the contract is valid as an exercise of a power incidental to the Secretary's power to make contracts for the waters impounded behind Hoover Dam.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.435" offset="11405145">Now, I suggested earlier that what the Secretary was doing was attempting to preserve for a -- as if it were preserved, a fundamental condition of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.700" offset="11478183">This is a rather familiar type of condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.214" offset="11496260">If, I promise for example to dig a 200 foot ditch for Mr. Ely at the rate of 25 feet a day, one of the implied conditions will be that he mustn't sleep out at night and fill in ten feet every night that I've dug that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.136" offset="11567940">Again, if I promise Mr. Wilmer to deliver him daily, 5000 weighed milk for my dairy, I'm excused from performing surely to the extent that Mr. Wilmer steals my milk for my cows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.888" offset="11634918">The case here is in principle, I submit, just the same as the latter illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.033" offset="11667519">Furthermore, it seems to me this is the kind of incidental power that an agent would be given in these circumstances even if it was not spelled out in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.951" offset="11719137">Let's suppose for example that I were authorized by a large dairy farm to contract for the delivery of its milk, surely also and only its milk so that I wouldn't be authorized to sell any cows but surely, I would be impliedly authorized to put in the contract a covenant that the obligation to make daily deliveries should be reduced by the extent to which the buyer killed the cows or slipped in and stole the milk first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.149" offset="11856018">And that is all we say that the Secretary was doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.917" offset="11875035">Now, the Master raised two objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.985" offset="11887261">He said that these clauses in the contract attempt to take away from Nevada and Arizona the right to determine priorities intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.891" offset="11938983">We deny that they have that right and I don't want to debate that point now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.751" offset="11958418">But even if they have it as we have shown in our brief, this is not true, Arizona would be free to protect the downstream appropriator and not permit the diversions upstream under her law as it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.507" offset="12029367">Or she chose to change her law, the Secretary's contract wouldn't stand in the way, it would simply determine what should be done on those -- under those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.306" offset="12156635">The other objection that the Master raised is he said this would make the Secretary's contracts with users in Arizona less than contracts for permanent use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.502" offset="12205432">I think the answer to that is that any contract for permanent use is certainly contingent under being water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.154" offset="12240018">Water may not come down because it doesn't rain, but it may also come down because somebody -- not come down because somebody has lawfully diverted it upstream and surely permanent is subject to that qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.071" offset="12303653">So we think that the contracts themselves are not only consistent but authorized under the Master's reading of Section 4 (a) and that they could perfectly well stand on that reading and indeed in a sense confirm it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.676" offset="12390066">I now turn therefore to the other main issue with respect to the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.826" offset="12426637">The matter of the priority issue as Mr. Ely has called it, the matter of ratable deduction as it might be called in times of shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.054" offset="12475538">Of course, we've already very largely answered the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.991" offset="12495287">What is to be -- about priority or division if the mainstream is seven and a half million acre-feet then California gets 4.4 million, Arizona gets 2.8 million and Nevada gets the remaining?</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.730" offset="12562265">If it's more than seven and a half million, they share equally or this is spelled out in the Act, in the contracts taken together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.582" offset="12605733">The only uncertainty is what happens when less than seven and a half million acre-feet is available, and on this point, neither the Project Act nor the Secretary's contracts given explicit answer California's thesis reduced to its simplest terms is this, the central theme of western water law is that one who first takes the claim and begins construction is entitled to the water claim that the Boulder Canyon Project was put down in that legal context without affecting the law or rights on the river except for the California limitation, that California having got there first and stated out the claims, is entitled to have them satisfied regardless of the effect upon others subject again only to the limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.142" offset="12835924">The opposing view which was espoused by the Master and Arizona and Nevada and the United States, centers about the proposition that the Project Act, taking a fresh start rejects the law of prior appropriation as unsuited to the development of the Colorado River Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.319" offset="12928606">And under -- and especially under national auspices, and instead provides its own rules of apportionment to be filled in by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.035" offset="12975522">And although there's no expressed provision in the Act or contracts for what will be done when there is a shortage that is less than seven and a half million acre-feet because it's perfectly clear that Congress assumed there wouldn't be any shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.602" offset="13033827">Our view is that nevertheless the Project Act and the Secretary's contracts contemplate equality of rank or priority among the states in respect to the quantities of water allocated to each regardless of when their projects were undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.578" offset="13113657">Now, I propose to develop our reasons for thinking that that is the contemplation of the Project Act and the Secretary's contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.413" offset="13181053">That's an important -- excuse me, I don't mean to be so informal but it's an important part of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.200" offset="13208221">I'm now going to take up the indications and the situation the Project Act and the Secretary's practice that seemed to us to indicate that a rule of ratability is much more consistent with the Act and the contract then resort to the law of prior appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.599" offset="13289723">First, in interpreting the Project Act, we submit, that the Court should keep consequently before it, two dominant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.715" offset="13334235">One is that the chief obstacle to the development of the Colorado River Basin was the law of prior appropriation and its consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.085" offset="13375718">The need was to assure the States' equality of access to a fair share of the water whether the State should be early or late in its development.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.649" offset="13417932">But the Upper Basin States were worried before the compact was signed, about the record growth of California and refused to support any Colorado River project within -- until the law of prior appropriation should be set aside at least as between the Upper and Lower Basin so that they would have equality of right when they needed the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.489" offset="13517302">That was done in the compact as between the Upper and Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.032" offset="13539453">Similarly, the next great obstacle to undertake into the project was the fear that California would expand its uses before Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.429" offset="13577070">So Arizona said, we can't ratify the compact until we're guarded against this consequence of the law of prior appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.957" offset="13611238">And one of the main purposes of the Project Act, we think, undeniably, was to get over this obstacle to beginning the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.630" offset="13649899">Now, the second dominating fact is that the project itself would show so far over overshadow any other development on the river as to make it appropriate to take a fresh start in the delivery -- in the division of the water provided that vested rights or are perfected rights, Mr. Justice Stewart, were protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.339" offset="13740701">It's the vast expenditures by the United States for the Hoover Dam and the related works that made the Colorado River available for beneficial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.868" offset="13786885">Before the project was undertaken, there were less than three and a half million acre-feet of uses downstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.345" offset="13816769">The necessary works were largely at the mercy of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.030" offset="13831502">There was no All-American Canal to carry water to the Imperial and Coachella Valleys, twice the river it changed its course so that none of these people downstream would have any water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.350" offset="13888763">California speaks of its claim the water for the Metropolitan Water District as a prior appropriated rate, but the truth is that in 1929, it was as I said that the last argument just to gleam in somebody's eye or at least some surveyor's maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.493" offset="13969324">And it's conceded that that Metropolitan Water District project never could have come into being if the United States had not dealt the Hoover Dam and started to plan for controlling the waters of the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="4463.791" offset="17958536">Then the fact that the Congress said with respect to present perfected right is a strong indication that the Congress was not concerned with the law of prior appropriation that it was, as I say, taking a fresh start.</text>

            <text syncTime="4484.571" offset="18041605">In the first place, having mentioned one that almost impliedly excludes the other; second, the -- if the Congress assumed that the law of prior appropriation was to be in effect, there was no reason to direct anybody to respect present perfected rights because the law of prior appropriation would cover those rights as well as the broader class of those that haven't been perfected; the third reason is, that the direction to respect present perfected right is inconsistent with recognizing the law of prior appropriations because one may get a perfected right before 1929, which under the statute would be senior and specifically senior to the unperfected claims of the California Metropolitan Water District and the excess claim, the increased use claim of the of the Imperial Valley which of course ancillary restraints the two claims as to which this is important.</text>

            <text syncTime="4861.677" offset="19550124">The statute gives very considerable instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.541" offset="19565484">For example, it gives instructions as the section has been mentioned before in the argument and I think not from the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.309" offset="19592652">But you will note that there are instructions over in Section 9 about who shall have the first opportunity to get contracts with the Secretary on reclaimed lands of federal instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.413" offset="19645001">Now, it seems to us that there are several indications which I would like to mention very briefly, both in the Project Act and in the compact that the right of the States which was pretty well marked out by Section 4 of the Project Act, the Secretary doesn't have any real discretion in that respect, are to be treated readily.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.589" offset="19749700">In the Project Act, in the compact, I should say, it seems to us that there are three that treat these sovereign bodies also this instance in terms of Upper Basin and the Lower Basin groups of State as equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.519" offset="19809468">The first place is the basic division.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.633" offset="19817932">And Article III (a) is made regardless of the volume of prior appropriations in either state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.434" offset="19853145">Article III (c) provides that if the surplus over 15 million acre-feet in the river is not enough to satisfy the obligations of the Mexican treaty then the two basins are to share equally, rule of ratability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.922" offset="19915107">Article III (f) which preserves the surplus against the claims of prior appropriation, again, seems to repudiate that as a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.327" offset="19956694">Now, the Project Act, the limitation to 4.4 million acre-feet if you construe it as the Master did, clearly, didn't recognize all California's prior appropriated claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4977.568" offset="20013641">Arizona and California are treated equally and they share up and down ratably in any surplus over the seven and half million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.099" offset="20047809">Section 4 (b), also dependent upon a compact, nevertheless seems to treat the States as of equal in rank, also not necessarily in the amounts of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.026" offset="20103502">And finally, in the debates in Congress, there was no -- no one ever suggested that the sovereign state should have anything but equality in the rank of their class.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.800" offset="20158568">Finally, I would point out that the Secretary of the Interior in times of shortage and reclamation project frequently makes a ratable distribution of the available water.</text>

            <text syncTime="5077.463" offset="20413210">Mr. Justice Black and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.535" offset="20429511">I'm representing the State of Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.906" offset="20446960">We are here once more in our attempt to, shall I say, hang on to this viable block of water which will determine the element, development of the southern part of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.660" offset="20526059">In the limited time that we have available, I would like to emphasize these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.983" offset="20563257">First, this contract between the State of Nevada and the Secretary of the Interior, for 300,000 acre-feet of Lake Mead storage, and I emphasize the word storage, is a valid and binding contract which should be upheld under whatever theory this case may be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.036" offset="20671509">I think to that extent, Nevada is in a different position than some of the other parties to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.396" offset="20700975">Second, we think that the Master was entirely correct in his analysis, resulting in his decision, that this figure of 300,000 acre-feet should not be diminished because of some prior existing diversions on some small tributaries which I will mention in detail later.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.796" offset="20810585">Next, that this contract with the State of Nevada is different from the contract with the State of Arizona is a specific whole contract in itself and does not require any implementation or addition of subsequent individual contracts with particular users.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.358" offset="20916851">We also emphasize the point that because in the case of Nevada, this additional stored water will be of necessity used for the assistance of human life that there is much reason to use judicial discretion in placing a floor under the amount to which it may be diminished in times of critical water shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.880" offset="21042866">And then incidentally, we have urged in our briefs and were mentioned briefly, it has been our opinion over the long whole -- the operation of the river would be better if the Court retain jurisdiction, appointed a permanent commission with an advisory committee representing the various individual states who could make the rules and regulations, the annual allotments and so forth for this precious water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.769" offset="21178493">To understand Nevada's position, it is necessary to look briefly at the physical situation which existed during the time that the Project Act was being considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.654" offset="21242023">The only water that was being diverted from the Colorado River system and as the State from the mainstream during all of the discussions, the Project Act was some water that was being diverted from the Virgin River and the Muddy River which are two small tributaries that's shown on the map behind me coming in to the upper end of the arm of the reservoir which runs north and south.</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.977" offset="21375248">There had been early pioneer settlements in that area starting along in the 1970s.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.550" offset="21397608">Principally, people of the LDS faith would come down from Salt Lake City.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.819" offset="21418611">And prior to the time that the Project Act was being considered, they had diverted all of the available water on those streams onto the flat land surrounding them and had applied it to beneficial use and it is estimated that that total consumption there is a consumptive use in the order of 50,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.414" offset="21517040">That was not a part of the mainstream water supply at the time the Project Act was being considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.263" offset="21548387">It was a maximum development.</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.445" offset="21561135">It cannot be increased in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.365" offset="21576808">There is no more water there that applied in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.634" offset="21593945">It is upon lands above the reservoir, so to that extent, this old rights in that corner of Nevada are different from the downstream rights in California and Arizona and that they cannot be supplied from storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.874" offset="21662908">They were supplied by tributary use prior to Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.913" offset="21679000">It will have to continue -- there is no possibility or event of an increase of use.</text>

            <text syncTime="5445.590" offset="21885680">There were people, very assiduously and carefully conserve every drop of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.095" offset="21911803">So, when I say it flowed in, I meant the stream bed in Virgin conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.094" offset="21931760">But after the irrigation developed, there was no water went in, that was well-known at the time of the Project Act and was taken into consideration by every engineer I think who studied the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.019" offset="21979408">The other portion of Nevada which is now using and will in the future use, the mainstream Colorado River water out of Lake Mead storage is the area that we call generally the Las Vegas Valley that lies to the west of the dam and the reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="5495.795" offset="22086510">These valleys are in a high plateau, and even to, with the dam there, it is necessary by pumps to lift the water in the order of 1200 feet in order to get it up where may be used.</text>

            <text syncTime="5553.911" offset="22319000">At the time of the Project Act, the only water that was being used there came from an underground supply, through wells, artesian and pumping.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.089" offset="22355780">For many years, more water was removed from that underground supply than was annually recharged so that it became necessary to bring in water from Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.284" offset="22404472">And today, the area has a population of approximately 170,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.783" offset="22438536">The number of school children has increased 50% even since the 1960 census.</text>
            <text syncTime="5591.342" offset="22468733">The absolute control in point of the development of that area is the amount of water that Nevada will get out of Lake Mead storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5603.256" offset="22516381">Nevada is unique and that there isn't any other source of water available good or bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.073" offset="22547623">There is no brackage water that could be converted, there's no seawater that can be converted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.391" offset="22576985">And the reason that Nevada has intervened in this case and is here today is because whatever decree may be entered is going to absolutely determine the size of the population that may live in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.410" offset="22648978">Detailed studies were introduced in the evidence by the best experts that Nevada could obtain, and throughout those studies, the water was not considered as being available or used for irrigation of crops as we ordinarily know it because it is too valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.448" offset="22733197">And all estimates of the requirements and the needs were based upon use for domestic purposes using that word in the broadest sense is also including industrial uses and of course the growth of shrubs and lawns and things of that sort around the homes.</text>

            <text syncTime="5905.357" offset="23724805">There was a contract made in March of 1942 and this bears on another issue and I can cover them at the same time between the United States acting through the Secretary of the Interior and the State of Nevada, a body politic and corporate and its Colorado River Commission, said Commission acting in the name of the State by that principle in its own behalf as well as in behalf of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.075" offset="23855626">And this term ‘state' as used in this contract being deemed to be both the State of Nevada and its Colorado River Commission, and that 1942 contract was for 100,000 acre-feet of water with no reference to any reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.998" offset="23931382">In 1944, in January, a supplemental contract was entered into which changed only paragraph of the 1942 contract but it did provide that the Secretary should deliver to the State each year including all other waters diverted for use within the State of Nevada from the Colorado River system, the amount necessary to supply 300,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5989.479" offset="24061262">Now, that is the time and those were the words that were inserted in that contract which changed the 300,000 acre-feet that until that time, everyone and I'm sure the Congress of the United States and Senator Pittman who was a leading exponent of this project legislation and all, all of a sudden by the insertion of those three words -- are those words, the 300,000 was reduced to 250,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.547" offset="24205563">And that Nebraska or rather Nevada has contested throughout this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6031.322" offset="24228655">We urge that it was ultra vires, that it was on the part of the state officials and on the part of the Secretary and we of course concur in the Master's argument as to why I think, he thinks it's improper which I will not repeat at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6046.081" offset="24287692">We have one other controversy with the United States which was not mentioned in this argument that was mentioned in the prior argument and in the briefs and that is as to whether there should be separate contracts in addition to the basic one with the State of Nevada was users of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6068.432" offset="24377135">And there, I think, the confusion arose because of the difference between the Nevada contract and the Arizona contract was not pointed out.</text>

            <text syncTime="6272.431" offset="25193096">The United States Government built the first pump and pipeline out of the reservoir.</text>

            <label>Mr. R. P. Parry</label>
            <text syncTime="6306.326" offset="25328724">The evidence in the record showed that by the year 2000, we picked that up just as a test year, that we would need more than 500,000 acre-feet of water if the orderly development went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6323.632" offset="25397896">So our present estimate is that the 300,000 will be consumed in the next few decades and some of it additionally of what we can divert with our present facilities is going to be needed badly in the next few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6342.007" offset="25471352">And that is one reason that from perhaps narrow point of view of the State of Nevada that this -- we think this is a justiciable controversy is that we must know as a matter of practicality the extent of Nevada's contract for water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6364.105" offset="25559751">Because just as in the evidence showed in the case of the Metropolitan Water District, the basic pumping clients, the basic tunnels and installations of that sort should be for economical reasons built to eventually supply the maximum amount at the time they are built.The individual pipelines may come in from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6391.347" offset="25668733">If California is correct and 180,000 acre-feet is to be taken away from us that is the water for about a half a million people under the best analysis an acre-foot of water will supply the annual consumption of about three people in that arid region.</text>
            <text syncTime="6413.583" offset="25757654">And there is a precise and definite question there which it would seem to us that all responsible people should decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="6430.089" offset="25823692">And I also concur, of course, in other broader argument, there is a justiciable controversy here as to the extent of this rapidly growing southwest region and all of which will in a sense be under a cloud of suspicion unless there is a determination of this water allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6454.600" offset="25921808">The -- in the brief, it seems to us that this case might be simplified this way, the Secretary of the Interior under the Project Act, just for the moment ignoring all the language of it, under the long line decisions of this Court, starting with the Appalachian case and going down through the Twin City Power case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.382" offset="26004877">Certainly, when he came in and took over the river which has been facetiously called the Red River which is an actual thing under the control of the United States, he took over all of the water rights regardless of what was there before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6490.000" offset="26063391">And if it had not been for the exemption of the present perfected rights, controlled also by the California limitation, I do not believe any attorney could argue to this Court but that the Secretary of the Interior had all the water rights in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="6507.202" offset="26132146">Also, under the Ivanhoe case and other cases, having that control and having impeded the flow of the river, counted it in the reservoir, created it into storage then he had the right to dispose of that by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6524.862" offset="26202781">And I believe that those broad principles will go a long way towards solving many of these rather specious points that have been argued at length in this tremendous record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6539.628" offset="26261922">In the, in the long run, that's the question, what --</text>

            <text syncTime="6583.014" offset="26435480">And that in the case of the State of Nevada, the State created a statutory body and is contracted for and is paying for that water, and subject only to the overall rule which I think pervades throughout the whole west that the water may not be wasted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6605.013" offset="26523460">And that should be applied to a beneficial use then in our opinion, the State of Nevada has the right to make those decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="6678.771" offset="26818435">I think that we must not ignore the basic rights of the United States when it comes in and takes physical control of a navigable stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="6692.919" offset="26875068">It seems to me if there is anything established in the law of the land now and that -- and I say that regardless of what all the Senators said to the contrary when they are arguing about this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6705.041" offset="26923551">What they said four years ago has but little resemblance to the law of that type of river as it has been announced by this Court since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6714.651" offset="26962004">When we start from that premise then I believe that we have a sound foundation upon which we can find in the Project Act, allocation of the type that the Master found.</text>
            <text syncTime="6729.037" offset="27019473">I believe that overall, he did an extraordinary job.</text>
            <text syncTime="6735.708" offset="27046222">As I comment before, Nevada came in as an intervenor, so to speak, not wanting to be squeezed between the two giants.</text>
            <text syncTime="6745.586" offset="27085720">But this water being so precious in our favor, we find ourselves now supporting the Master's decision most wholeheartedly.</text>
