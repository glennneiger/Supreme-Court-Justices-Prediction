            <text syncTime="800.223" offset="3304260">I perhaps should say, at the outset, that I -- as all argue is too regarded a privileged to present any matter to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.772" offset="3342503">I do not feel that it is a privilege in the broader sense of the term to have to appear before in this particular situation and as much as, it involves 10 years of litigation of a bankrupt company whose sole and only asset is this treble damage action and judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.376" offset="3432887">Now, therefore, I am appearing before you to feel such help and aid as I may in helping this Court to reach the right conclusion in this case, with the thought that this litigation maybe brought to an end sometime, some place.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.967" offset="3531212">After reading the opinion of the Court of Appeals in which the bankrupt acquired a victory insofar as liability is concerned, a further reading of the opinion discloses the fact that we can only look forward to many more years of litigation before this case may be finally disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.901" offset="3631000">We are now hereon a question that I frankly do not believe is presented by the record in this case and I will enter my -- direct my discussion to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.206" offset="3676244">Before I get in to a discussion of that, however, I think it might be well to just briefly refer to the question that we are considering.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.490" offset="3725354">It is generally stated as to whether or not cooperatives can be found in violation of the antitrust laws whether the only proof, and my emphasis as I used the word only here if the Court please, that they were engaging in processing and marketing operations under the Capper-Volstead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.031" offset="3847502">Well at first blush, I would have to say that certainly the Capper-Volstead Act gives all cooperatives the right to engage in any farmer collective action which relates to the marketing and processing of the products of their grower members, but that doesn't dispose of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.975" offset="3951261">We still have to determine what marketing and processing is because Section 6 of the Clayton Act which was the forerunner to Capper-Volstead merely gave the growers the right to combine together as this Court stated in the Borden case and again, in Maryland Milk for the purpose of being able to do collectively what they otherwise wouldn't be able to do as single organizations either it's corporate, or a single floor members.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.740" offset="4102353">Now, with that background, it seems clear that under an interpretation of Capper-Volstead Act that there is always in the proper case a question of fact and a mixed question of fact in law perhaps as to whether the activities in which the cooperative or cooperatives, and it makes no difference in that respect, engaged because certainly they are subject to the limitations provided in Section 6 of the Clayton Act that those activities must be directed toward the carrying out of their lawfully authorized activity, which are of course marketing and processing of the products to their grower members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.824" offset="4314676">So that to merely state that they are engaging as the question does here only in marketing and processing, it seems to me does not get us very far in solving the problem that this Court is confronted with in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.119" offset="4383848">Now, how did this question arise that is presented?</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.937" offset="4399104">It might shed some further light on it by referring to counsel's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.272" offset="4424495">On page 17 and 18 where they deal with this question, they first summarized the charge of the court and this charge was a long charge as Your Honors know, containing some 54 pages, the discussion on the instructions which preceded it cover 424 pages and --</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.190" offset="5096155">We, therefore, have these very extended discussions and the instructions, but the theory of the violation here is clearly set forth in the amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.545" offset="5145579">It was succinctly and clearly one of a third-party conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.318" offset="5168671">That is a conspiracy to restrain and to monopolize trade and commerce in citrus juices' process in California and sold in interstate commerce and the achievement or the actual monopolization of that trading commerce by the combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.755" offset="5254353">That was the theory, that was the violation charged in the amended complaint, and we went to trail on that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.043" offset="5287581">Now, that was the theory in which that broadly evidence was in, the case was argued to the jury. Counsel for the petitioners here insisted that the court instruct them after he completed his instruction that this was a five party conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.811" offset="5374621">In other words, that's what we charged and they wanted to be sure that that was clear to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.699" offset="5398131">At no time in the argument was there any defense or any argument made either by counsel for the petitioners, or for the respondents here that this was anything, but a five-party conspiracy but it was a conspiracy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.466" offset="5473259">It was not an attempt to monopolize case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.993" offset="5487365">It was a Section 1 under Section 2 Sherman Act conspiracy combination charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.719" offset="5518294">That was the violation charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.692" offset="5530102">Now, some reference is made here about these six acts and I want to briefly discuss that because while, I don't regard it as important, there were important only in this case as far as liability is concerned as being the acts which the respondents claim were performed pursuant to the violation or a conspiracy and which caused the damage claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.766" offset="5626441">In other words, in a Government case that this Court well knows, the only thing the Government has to prove in Sherman Act case is the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.021" offset="5679417">However, in a treble damage action, the plaintiff must proceed further and not only prove the violation but the commission of some act or acts, committed pursuant thereto which caused the damage claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.339" offset="5732707">That's the other element of a -- of a -- of the case which is present in the private suit which is not present in a Government case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.157" offset="5771995">Now, these six acts were both evidence of the violation, but not the only evidence of the violation charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.609" offset="5797804">There are also claimed to be acts committed pursuant to this conspiracy which caused the damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.288" offset="5828524">We do not have presented in this question, the matter of causation and other matters which deal with -- of the petition which respondents have pending in this Court in an effort to get this case possibly disposed off them, finale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.910" offset="5894980">So we are not commenting or discussing that at this time obviously, but I am stating to the Court the background so that we can see what the violation was that was actually charged here, what its theory was and what the evidence was to support that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.385" offset="5968959">We're not going to go into that of course, but that was the theory of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.413" offset="5992991">Now, we get down to a discussion of the instructions, proceeding now back to the petitioner's brief, page 18, may say that this question was created by five instructions which were given by the court out of the very many contain in the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.061" offset="6075643">(A) Is, first only one combination or conspiracy was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.960" offset="6091212">We conceive that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.733" offset="6094346">There was never any claim made that there were several conspiracies here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.594" offset="6113782">That was not the theory of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.851" offset="6122768">(B) was the one were the -- I had requested the instruction that a corporation and its subsidiary and that is the legal status of the defendant Sunkist and of its subsidiary Exchange Orange which was its processing company, that they could under the decisions of this Court, namely the [Inaudible] and Yellow Cab could conspire together as corporations and separate entities only, that's the charge Your Honor, to violate the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.784" offset="6266546">They -- they say that that should have been given, that that was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.910" offset="6283055">Then (C) is but not withstanding the charge, then they go on to say that the trial court inspected them, and this was after the charge and when they had and I had also requested certain clarification that they have received at this time a clarification from a court that this was a five-party conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.819" offset="6386604">And then during the course of that comment, the judge -- the trial judge said that this being a conspiracy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.216" offset="6416280">You may find that all conspired and none conspired or the less than the five conspire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.949" offset="6439163">They complain about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.913" offset="6447000">They do not say in this brief, quote and this is in the record after that was then given and the judge said, “Do you have any other objections?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.418" offset="6481063">The counsel for the petitioners here said, “I think we are content.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.677" offset="8710040">Your Honor, I believe the Court has answered that question in the Maryland Milk case where Mr. Justice Black specifically said that the Maryland Milk Cooperative and its conduct is charged in the Government's case or compliant violated Section 2, the monopolization section of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.952" offset="8819231">Now, that was a specific case where a cooperative under that decision as I read it was held to be subject to the Sherman Act without reference to whether it engaged in any combination or conspiracy with its competitors, whether they were third-party, non-cooperatives, or anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.168" offset="8916093">Now, as I read that opinion Your Honor, I think this Court has already ruled, but big cooperative may violate without any arrangement whatever with sec -- with a third party, non-cooperative, corporation, or organization to Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2252.134" offset="9111907">This is one of the instructions they requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.370" offset="9124864">This is number 4, “You are further instructed that defendant Sunkist is in legal effect,” I emphasis that, a single cooperative marketing organization consisting of a number of components including defendant Exchange Orange and alleged co-conspirator Exchange Lemon, and this is the point and that this cooperative marketing organization being in effect a single entity is as a matter of law incapable of conspiring with or within itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.352" offset="9296750">That's number four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.910" offset="9303019">In other words Your Honor will see that I think certain obvious things immediately that this instruction in number five of the -- in substance the same that there can be no conspiracy and so on and then it went on to say you may not find that there was any conspiracy in this case, either a conspiracy to restrain trade or a conspiracy to monopolize trade unless you find from the preponderance of the evidence that either TreeSweet or Silzle was a party to such a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.829" offset="9438647">Now, number five quite obviously would make it impossible if that is the law for a cooperative organization either as a single unit or as a number of units operating in some closely knit manner to ever violate Sections 1 -- I mean 2 of the Sherman Act and the Court said that, during the discussion of these instructions, why counsel admitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.339" offset="9544704">Counsel for the petitioners here admitted during this discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.010" offset="9559437">Yes, this charge and this request requires the court to ignore the corporate entities and the corporate entity theories and the court said, “Well, I don't see anything in the Capper-Volstead Act which provides for such an exception.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.441" offset="9641148">In other words, on that basis the court -- the trial court in the discussion of this instructions of which this have perhaps the key instructions on this point, refused to give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.937" offset="9695169">Now, they did give the instruction that I requested, the trial court did which was our number two or number six, on page 148 which was modified by the Court, but this instruction merely stated the law -- I'm sorry, it's number two --'</text>

            <label>Mr. Herman F. Selvin</label>
            <text syncTime="2938.247" offset="11856332">Judge Carter, James Carter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.781" offset="11866467">I wasn't at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.875" offset="11870856">All I know I'm in the same position as the Court Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.415" offset="11880991">All I know about the case is what I read in the record, but I do agree with Mr. Dixon that the narrow issue to be decided in this case is simply whether the doctrine of intra-corporate or intra-enterprise conspiracy is applicable to Capper-Volstead cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.672" offset="11978062">He cites the Keffer, Stuart case [Inaudible] decided a number of others along with it of course, Timken Roller Bearing I think is was another one, Yellow Cab is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.440" offset="12017142">But it seems to me that all that was done in those cases in respect to intra-corporate conspiracy was to point out that where there was otherwise an unprivileged, in other words a proscribed combination or conspiracy, it was no defense that some of the conspirators were corporately affiliated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.495" offset="12097390">Now, here the affiliation, the affiliation is the very thing if I am right about the construction to be given to Capper-Volstead, the affiliation is the very thing that is privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.381" offset="12132916">It's the very thing that's taken out of the antitrust law because Congress has told farmers that without fear from the other -- of the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.452" offset="12165204">They may cooperate or act collectively in the processing and marketing of their commodities and they may do it through cooperative instrumentalities or agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.366" offset="12220792">Now, while pressed several times, Mr. Dixon couldn't quite bring himself to give a categorical answer to the question of whether the jury in this case under the charge as given could have returned a verdict based on conspiracy among the only the components of the Sunkist organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.006" offset="12315355">I think his last answer was in effect an admission if that was so he said, “Well, probably they could have, but they wouldn't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.629" offset="12341896">The trial judge didn't think they never returned that kind of a verdict.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.200" offset="12356211">We requested the special interrogatories in that case which would have compelled the jury to tell us who the conspirators were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.879" offset="12386931">The judge didn't give the special verdict, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.309" offset="12396648">Mr. Dixon objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.318" offset="12400619">He wanted the general verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.656" offset="12405948">He wanted the benefit of the blanket box that you get from the general verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.974" offset="12423293">He wanted the benefit of the cover up of error inside the jury room that you find from a general verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.401" offset="12445027">The special interrogatories would have settled this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.855" offset="12454745">We didn't know who the conspirators were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.804" offset="12462582">We didn't know whether the jury returned a verdict based on this so called abuse of monopoly power and we then could have argued that one theory right or wrong, as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.645" offset="12501974">We had at least three theories of liability go to the jury like to verdict is general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.526" offset="12521514">We don't know which -- which theory influenced the jury it and as a consequence the rule as well-establish, the cases are at page 19 of our first brief that in that situation if anyone of the theories is wrong, the judgment can't be upheld because perhaps that was the one that brought about the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.429" offset="12593089">Now, so far as abusive monopoly power is concerned, you can't abuse something you don't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.544" offset="12621511">There was no monopoly power in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.522" offset="12633422">Sunkist didn't have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.268" offset="12640423">The monopoly is claimed to exist in product oranges, not the oranges we sell as fresh fruit but the oranges that we sell to processors to be processed in the juice or to some other byproduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.861" offset="12686817">The record shows that we have on the average and in 1951, we have about 70% of the available product oranges in California and Arizona, but the other 30% was in other hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.786" offset="12734568">It was not under our control and one supplier, the supplier with whom the respondents have dealt since 1947 and who was characterized in the record as their principle supplier, one supplier had 12% to 15% of the entire supply that was more than enough to fulfill as it had been in the past, all the respondents' product -- orange requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.619" offset="12829863">What happen in ‘51?</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.763" offset="12838431">He clamped down on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.695" offset="12846164">He gave them 6000 tons of oranges, but under a processing contract that required them to process them in to frozen concentrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.465" offset="12877197">He wouldn't give them oranges for single-strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.003" offset="12887333">That's what happened to the respondents in 1951, their regular supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.959" offset="12903215">They haven't dealt with us except to the minor way since 1947, but their regular supplier with plenty of oranges, he himself said, “I have lots of oranges,” this is his testimony, with no home for them except Winckler &amp; Smith, Case-Swayne, Paramount and a few other small firms, that was the exact testimony, 6000 tons of oranges, they got 6000 tons in single-strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.695" offset="12998196">It was practically normal here for this respondent, but their regular supplier shut them down on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.888" offset="13018885">For what reason, curiously enough because he had sold oranges to Case-Swayne to be processed in the single-strength juice and he said quite candidly from the witness stand is somewhat ingeniously that he wouldn't give Winckler Oranges for single-strength because he didn't want his own oranges out in the market competing against each other in the form of juice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.554" offset="13113553">That's the whole secret of the lost to this respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.377" offset="13124838">Sunkist had nothing to do with that [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.561" offset="13133615">Morgan Ward, that's the supplier to whom I am referring, has no connection whatever with Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.042" offset="13151587">Sunkist didn't even know Morgan Ward had not supplied Winckler in 1951 as he had in prior years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.427" offset="13185128">Now, that 30 % outstanding completely negates any suggestion that Sunkist have monopoly power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.341" offset="13208743">Monopoly power by definition is the power on the part of the monopolist to eliminate competition at anytime he desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.838" offset="13238732">Winckler's elimination couldn't have occurred except, except for the refusal of Morgan Ward to sell oranges for single-strength juice to Winckler, completely negates any suggestions that Sunkist had monopoly power.</text>
