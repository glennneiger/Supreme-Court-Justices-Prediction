            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 477, Edward Yellin, Petitioner, versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.144" offset="243963">Mr. Rabinowitz, you may proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="38.354" stopTime="282.066">
            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="38.354" offset="256815">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.615" offset="269876">The petitioner here was convicted of a violation of Section 192 of Title 18 for contempt of Congress for his failure to answer four questions put by a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities at a hearing held in Gary, Indiana in February of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.574" offset="361618">The alleged subject under inquiry was Communist infiltration at the basic industry and it was the 10th investigation that the Committee has held on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.246" offset="412400">The petitioner testified in between the Watkins and the Barenblatt decisions of this Court and then refusing to answer the questions put.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.942" offset="455137">He relied on what he conceived to be his rights under the Watkins decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.088" offset="479692">He also cited the vagueness of the authorizing resolution, his rights as he conceived them to be under the First Amendment, the lack of jurisdiction of the Committee over the subject of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.227" offset="536325">He did not rely on the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.995" offset="555342">He was not tried until after the Barenblatt decision and he was found guilty on all four counts and received the maximum sentence possible under the statute namely one year in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.553" offset="613543">Prior to the time he testified, he had been a steelworker employed in Gary.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.066" offset="639666">At the time he testified, he was an engineering student at the University of Colorado, subsequently, received a Fourth Foundation grant at the University of Illinois, he's now a candidate for his doctor's degree which I think he will probably receive in June.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.955" offset="715212">Each one of these Section 192 cases come before this -- that come before this Court have tracks which distinguish this -- this case from all of the other cases and I'll state those facts, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.351" offset="776756">But I should like to state in all conduct that the constitutional issues in this case, which I propose to raise again, are indistinguishable from the constitutional issues in Barenblatt, Wilkinson and Braden.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.039" offset="847496">And I propose to urge that the decision of the Court in those cases should be reviewed and should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.395" offset="888978">The petitioner was subpoenaed to appear on February 10th, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.890" offset="914892">On February 6th, prior to the hearing, I, who was representing the petitioner, sent a telegram to the counsel for the Committee reading as follows, "Undersigned represents Edward Yellin and Nicholas Busic.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.181" offset="1000051">On their behalf, I request executive session in lieu of open session.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.918" offset="1023039">Testimony needed for legislative purposes can be secured in executive session without exposing witnesses to publicity."</text>
            <text syncTime="240.910" offset="1067029">This request was made in view of Rule IV (a) of the rules of the Committee which reads as follows, "If a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee, duly appointed as provided by the rules of the House of Representatives, believes that the interrogation of a witness in a public hearing might endanger national security or unjustly injure his reputation or the reputation of other individuals, the Committee shall interrogate such witness in an Executive Session for the purpose of determining the necessity or advisability of conducting such interrogation thereafter at a public hearing."</text>

            <text syncTime="287.741" offset="1254379">On the same day, I received, in response to my telegram, a telegram signed not by Mr. Tavenner to whom I have addressed my wire but a telegram signed by Mr. Arens, Staff Director, which telegram read as follows, "Reurtel requesting executive session in lieu of open session for Edward Yellin and Nicholas Busic.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.886" offset="1354898">Your request denied."</text>
            <text syncTime="317.185" offset="1372139">At the hearing in Gary, I sought to introduce these two telegrams into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.709" offset="1394186">Congressman Walter who was residing at the hearing refused to accept the telegrams into the record and in the conformity with normal practice at congressional hearings refused to let me say anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.235" offset="1456358">He testified at the trial, and at that time he stated that he had never seen the telegrams.He had no idea at all as to what was in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.671" offset="1498049">He said that he thought, and I quote, "They were more or less in the nature of a request to postpone without grounds."</text>
            <text syncTime="359.039" offset="1539532">As a matter of fact, he said that he hadn't seen the telegrams until he got on the stand at the trial in Gary two or three years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.563" offset="1585612">He said all of this was a big misunderstanding that I made a mistake in sending the telegram to Mr. Tavenner, that I should have sent the telegram to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.386" offset="1632946">Arens, he said, had no authority to deny such a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.753" offset="1654366">He said, and I quote again, "I am sure this could not have happened, had you addressed your telegram to me.Had he knew one of the request?"</text>
            <text syncTime="399.597" offset="1701804">He said, and I quote again, "We might have a different situation today."</text>

            <text syncTime="432.592" offset="1833775">Yes, Chairman of the Subcommittee and, of course, of the Committee as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.233" offset="1852270">And he said at that time that long time ago when they decided to call Mr. Yellin, they had decided considered the question of an executive session, I had decided not to call him an executive session.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.771" offset="1906500">The reason that they had decided not to call him in an executive session was that they had received the report from Mr. Collins, a former F.B.I. agent, who was an investigator for the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.878" offset="1950908">And I quote from page 70 of the record, "His story was that this man was a known Communist, that he had been active in the international conspiracy, that he had deceived his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.803" offset="1994585">And furthermore, he came within the category of those people that we were experiencing a great deal of difficulty in finding out about with respect to the colonization."</text>
            <text syncTime="485.215" offset="2044217">Question, "Did you assume from Mr. Collins' report that Mr. Yellin would be a witness who would refuse to give information to the Committee?"</text>
            <text syncTime="492.738" offset="2074311">Answer, "We had no way of knowing."</text>
            <text syncTime="494.862" offset="2082774">Question, "Well, what conclusions did you draw from the report of Mr. Collins which you have just related?"</text>
            <text syncTime="500.768" offset="2106493">Answer, "We concluded that this would be a fine witness for the Committee in support of proposed legislation having to do with colonization and two, having to do with the protection of our defense efforts and it is always worth the chance that somebody will testify."</text>
            <text syncTime="517.292" offset="2172531">Question, "But wasn't it worth the chance of calling him an executive session to see what his position would have been?"</text>
            <text syncTime="525.044" offset="2203564">Answer, "I'm sure that had you communicated this whole matter to the Committee before we left Washington so that we should -- could have given the due consideration, we would have and always do, we might have a different situation today."</text>
            <text syncTime="540.471" offset="2265213">I then said, "Well, I raised it at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.311" offset="2276603">Couldn't you have called an executive session right then and there?"</text>
            <text syncTime="547.760" offset="2294366">And he said, "Well, I didn't know what was in these telegrams.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.876" offset="2302830">I thought you were just asking for postponement."</text>
            <text syncTime="553.477" offset="2317249">And then I said, at page 71 of the record, "When did you first learn that I had made an application for an executive session?"</text>
            <text syncTime="561.289" offset="2348492">Answer, "I believe today.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.721" offset="2362284">I'd never seen these telegrams, actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.144" offset="2371897">I heard you mention them, at least now my recollection is, I heard you mention them but I haven't seen them until this minute."</text>
            <text syncTime="576.561" offset="2409618">And then subsequently, at rule -- at page 72, he says that as I say, if he had known of the request, we might have a different situation today.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.053" offset="2459564">Now -- it's rather unjust to send them in to jail for a year because of the misunderstanding with the Chairman of the Committee, who wasn't sufficiently interested to read the telegrams which were -- which I was attempting to present to him at the hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.368" offset="2580877">At the opening of the hearing, the witness identified himself and this is -- well, I -- I think that the hearing is attached to the record that -- that is the printed transcript, it's attached to the record that Your Honors have.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.764" offset="2666454">It appears at page 1974 of the printed record which should be an appendix to what Your Honors have.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.174" offset="2700100">And Mr. Yellin was asked about his name and where he lives and then I said, "Mr. Counsel, I wonder whether it would be possible to read into the record the exchange of telegram -- telegrams between myself and the Committee in connection with the witness's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.419" offset="2773034">I would like to have it appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.305" offset="2780557">"The Chairman said, "We will decide whether it will be made a part of the record when the executive session is held."</text>
            <text syncTime="675.020" offset="2803440">Congressman Walter said that no executive session ever was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.274" offset="2816502">"Go ahead."</text>
            <text syncTime="679.390" offset="2820890">And then I said, "Mr. Chairman, I sent the telegram because I wanted them to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.709" offset="2838235">I don't care whether they appear publicly or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.975" offset="2847222">I do want it to appear that the exchange of telegrams occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.107" offset="2859760">I didn't do it just to increase the revenue of the telegram company."</text>
            <text syncTime="693.017" offset="2875434">And the Chairman said, "Well, whatever the reason was, whether it's been stated or otherwise, it will be considered in executive session."</text>
            <text syncTime="700.125" offset="2903855">I then said, "May I state?"</text>
            <text syncTime="702.590" offset="2913782">And the Chairman said, "Do not bother.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.395" offset="2924962">You know the privileges given you by this Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.639" offset="2933948">You have appeared before often enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.525" offset="2941471">You know as well as anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.599" offset="2949726">Go ahead, Mr. Tavenner."</text>
            <text syncTime="713.393" offset="2956936">And I know from having appeared before this Committee on previous occasions that this is usually the prelude to the possibility that counsel will be asked to leave the witness room -- the hearing room and so I used my discretion and I sat down.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.708" offset="3038229">I would like to note first that the standards used by Mr. Walter in applying Rule IV of the Committee were quite different from the standards used by the Committee, standard set forth in the rules rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.820" offset="3090683">The rules say that an executive Committee shall be held when the Committee believes that the interrogation of a witness in a public hearing might endanger national security or unjustly injure his reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.228" offset="3148257">Congressman Walter, in his testimony at page 70, said that they had decided to hear Mr. Yellin at a public session instead of an executive session because the man was a known Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.101" offset="3195800">He'd been active in the international conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.654" offset="3206040">He had deceived his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.648" offset="3213981">And then he came within a category of those who might give information.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.434" offset="3237073">Now, the Government has responded to this by saying that, well, under the rules, no one has a right to an executive session.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.126" offset="3279914">And I suppose that that is probably true.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.487" offset="3293288">I do submit, however, that under the rules, everyone has a right to a good faith consideration of a request for an executive session.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.803" offset="3334562">Such a request was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.256" offset="3344384">It was communicated from counsel to counsel, which is the normal way of communication between parties to litigation or what, this possible potential litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.213" offset="3396211">And there was no good faith or any other kind of consideration given to the request in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.335" offset="3428707">The Committee is bound by its rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.025" offset="3439470">This Court has frequently so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.361" offset="3452844">And I submit that under the circumstances here, the petitioner was entitled to a good faith consideration of his application.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.043" offset="3503522">He never received any consideration of his application either in good faith or otherwise and that these grounds alone are sufficient for our reversal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.497" offset="3569351">I would like next to move to a problem that is raised, I think inherently, in all of the cases since the Barenblatt decision, although I don't believe that the Court has ever addressed itself to it as fully as I would like to have the Court address itself to it on this occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.395" offset="3676975">In the Barenblatt case, the Court used this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.435" offset="3701112">When First Amendment rights are asserted to bar governmental interrogation, resolution of the issue always involves a balancing by the Courts of competing private and public interests at stake in the particular circumstances shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.931" offset="3795048">I cannot, as a philosophical matter, accept the balancing theory at all but as I think, one of the members of this Court said, assuming what I cannot assume namely that the balancing theory is what we are to adopt here.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.107" offset="3863803">I was confronted at the trail of his case of following the rule that the Court had laid down in the Barenblatt case and, therefore, I address myself to the question of balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.102" offset="3907793">What are we balancing here?</text>
            <text syncTime="954.071" offset="3919705">The Court first speaks in terms of the competing private and public interests at stake in the particular circumstances shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.797" offset="3962546">To me, that sounds like this is the question of fact to be determined in each case in accordance with the particular circumstances in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.775" offset="4002461">Now, it's hard and I was puzzled about how to address myself to this problem but it wasn't my language and it wasn't my ruling, it was this Court's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.829" offset="4050735">And so at the trial, I attempted to address myself to this question, what are we balancing?</text>
            <text syncTime="993.873" offset="4078843">What are the elements and the scale?</text>
            <text syncTime="996.665" offset="4090023">And what way are we to assign to each of these elements?</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.256" offset="4108413">Who was to decide this question?</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.348" offset="4120743">The Barenblatt decision says resolution of the issue always involves a balancing by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.200" offset="4152195">And so the Courts, presumably, in the first instance, the trial court has to balance these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.748" offset="4198379">Now, part of the question is easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.141" offset="4207888">On the one side of the balance is the public interest in national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.085" offset="4235682">How much weight is to be given to that side of the scale?</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.163" offset="4256057">Is it possible that each judge reads the morning newspapers, decides how much protection the national interest requires this day or this year and then ascribes in some way and this becomes almost a metaphysical problem, how much weight he's going to give to the -- to that aspect of the national security?</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.345" offset="4344769">Or is this a question of fact that's to be determined on the basis of evidence which is presented in Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.395" offset="4376952">Since the first possibility seem to me inconceivable, I address myself to the second and I attempted to or for evidence in Court as to the nature of the national security interest involved and how much weight should be given to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.444" offset="4453125">And I could think of no better way to approach to this problem than to present expert testimony on it and that's what I tried to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.922" offset="4491055">I presented an expert witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.407" offset="4500982">It was Professor Thomas I. Emerson, professor of law at Yale University, who has devoted the last 10 or 15 years of his life to a discussion of problems involving freedom of speech and national security and their impact on each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.735" offset="4562317">And I offered him as an expert witness on the question of how much weights to be given to part of this of this -- on the scale that -- to solve this factual problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.447" offset="4613204">His testimony was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.469" offset="4625220">The court said this was not a proper subject or testimony in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.227" offset="4644237">The Court of Appeals later said, this is a question of law to be decided by the Court and therefore the exclusion of the testimony was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.124" offset="4683839">I don't understand what that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.347" offset="4696795">But in any event, Professor Emerson's testimony was -- was excluded as I say, however, it does appear in the record as an offer of proof and it can be read by the Court at pages 91 to 114 inclusive and in our opinion, it should have been admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.823" offset="4778715">I'm now addressing myself to the weight of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.114" offset="4791777">I'm not addressing myself to whether it proves the case that I was trying to prove but rather to the admissibility of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.507" offset="4821452">And I submit that the Court was in error in excluding that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.867" offset="4846843">The second thing that I tried to do in meeting this question of how much weight has to be given to the national interest was to attempt to prove at the trial that the information that was sought of the petitioner by the questions which are the subject matter of the inquiry, which are the subject matter of the indictment here, that these questions were trivial, that they will miniscule, that they were so unimportant that even if they were placed in this scale, they wouldn't amount too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.701" offset="4990203">It is conceited now that as to two of the questions, namely, "Where did you reside in 1957 and were you a member of the Communist Party in 1949" were corroborative, corroborative of information that was already in the files of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.816" offset="5082676">The other two questions, which were questions formed in this jargon that the Committee has developed, "What do you know about colonization in the steel industry?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.850" offset="5130742">Incidentally, I object to those questions on the ground that this word "colonization" is a peculiar word of ought that experts and the Committee know but the witnesses at a congressional Committee aren't necessarily required to brush up on but of course it was given concurrent sentence so even if I win on those two questions, I haven't won my case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.575" offset="5221648">In any event, it was my argument that these two questions relating to colonization in basic industry had been the subject of testimony at nine prior hearings in Buffalo, in Flint, in New Orleans, in Denver, in Baltimore, all over the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.153" offset="5303986">Now, with three or four other witnesses who cooperative fully at the Gary hearing until the great deal about this subject and that therefore this testimony on these two questions was cumulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.485" offset="5353305">Now, the Government says, and I think the Government is right, that even corroborative questions and even cumulative questions are pertinent because they're corroborative or cumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.418" offset="5408998">They maybe pertinent, but they don't weigh much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.037" offset="5427493">They have no great weight in the balance which this Court has directed should be struck in each particular circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.021" offset="5475453">That is the point of my argument with respect to these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.523" offset="5497501">Now, what's on the other side of the balance?</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.515" offset="5513383">To balance the public interest, the national security, the weight to which we still don't know and how much weight is to be given to those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.281" offset="5568449">I think we can agree here that on the other side of the scale are those great rights that are protected by the First Amendment, the right of privacy, the right of free speech, the right of assembly and above all, and most important of all, the right of the public to hear a debate of the important issues that are confronting the world today and confronting the United today -- United States today in an open society without fear of a subpoena from a congressional Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.130" offset="5727901">Those are the rights on the other side of the scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.739" offset="5758307">I cannot believe that the Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson cases can be explain by the feeling of any member of this Court that those First Amendment rights are unimportant or that they don't require protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.063" offset="5831659">As a matter of fact, this Court has protected those rights and has protected them very effectively in cases like NAACP against Louisiana, Bates against Little Rock, Shelton against Tucker and others.</text>
