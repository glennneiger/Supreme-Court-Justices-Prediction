            <text syncTime="52.383" offset="313950">In this case, we're asking the Court to review the constitutional validity of a contempt conviction of petitioner with who has been adjudged in the contempt of court and sentenced to six months imprisonment, $400 fine and six months additional if the fine is not paid, for his refusal to abide by a court order which would require him to bring before the Florida Legislative Investigation Committee, the respondents here, to verify his answers as to their questions about alleged communists who were supposedly be members of the petitioner's organization which happens to be the minor branch of the NAACP.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.256" offset="557411">Petitioner contends that in his basis refusal to submit to the order of the Court and to the order of the committee contends that this matter was foreclosed by NAACP versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.487" offset="630345">And that for this reason, that the order of the court below which would require him not to give up the entire membership list or to authenticate his answers by reference thereto is in substance a -- or cannot be sustained for -- on the grounds of the theory of this Court in the NAACP versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.033" offset="732536">For that reason, he has refused to submit to this and the -- his conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Florida and this matter has been brought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.951" offset="780184">We have set out in our brief, this -- for this Court on page 2, the law under which the Investigation Committee Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.767" offset="831488">It is investigating by the -- in Florida, the activities of organizations and the persons engaged in act of violence or advocating a course of conduct which would constitute a violation of Florida law.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.020" offset="964504">The present Act before the Court is Chapter 59-207 of the laws of Florida of 1959 by the transcendence or statute which was enacted in 1956 and this committee was organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.680" offset="1027093">The committee was reconstituted in 1957 and reestablished in 1959 and I believe Mr. Hawes can verify this that the committee as -- was reestablished in the 1961 legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.199" offset="1109222">Now, in our judgment, what the -- what was occurred in the -- before the committee on November the 5th and 4th -- and the 5th, of 1959, was that the petitioner who was the custodian of the membership list of the Miami organization, was called before the committee and before he testified, there was a testimony of an investigator for the committee who indicated that there were some 14 persons will be named who he indicated that he knew or believed to be members of the Communist Party and also members of the Miami branch of the NAACP.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.263" offset="1309424">The petitioner himself was called and was asked as to whether he would -- was prepared to be brought -- had he brought a membership list to be required, he had not -- wasn't prepared to answer questions concerning the identification or association of those persons with the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.269" offset="1393434">This he refused to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.257" offset="1401375">He indicated to the committee that he would answer any questions from his own knowledge as to the membership of the alleged communists, the 14 persons' name with the organization but refuse to bring the association's membership list to verify his answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.200" offset="1481206">On the next day, a -- and this is -- I think this is an important issue or fact here because our contentions will be in this case that there must be some predicate for the inquiry.</text>
