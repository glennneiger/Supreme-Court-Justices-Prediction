            <text syncTime="271.057" offset="1187610">I think of paramount importance here is the fact that the -- in addition to the Department of Defense Directive which is reproduced on the record page 99 to 103 in which it says in its paragraph 5, top of page 102 of the record, personnel who write for outside publication not in connection with their official duties on any subject shall ascertain and so forth that it will not interfere with their regular duties, the Navy Manual, a public information manual, which is reproduced on page 7A in the appendix to our brief in 55, U.S. Navy Public Information Manual, an official publication of the department labeled (Inaudible) P1035, Article 0514 provides in its sub (a), within the bounds of security, the writing of articles, speeches and similar material intended for publication on topics of military and professional interest is desirable and so authorized and in (b), commanders will provide full cooperation compatible with military security and/or assistants in the preparation of such material.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.359" offset="1744854">These rounds out the sentence, first, they may receive pay for private literary effort but they may not receive pay or any other remuneration for the preparation of material required by their duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.195" offset="5020191">Don't forget that here a speech was involved and there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.330" offset="5040671">The speech is prepared for oral delivery and when you distribute it in a form of a press release, it's for the convenience of the press to let people know what you plan to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.553" offset="5085602">And I will say that when the Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit reversed Judge Yankwich, they did so without citing a single case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.834" offset="5122696">They praised the opinion of the District Court remarkably clear and comprehensive review of the law with respect to a dedicatory divestitive type of distribution of copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.970" offset="5175254">But they said he had stretched the facts a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.706" offset="5186226">There was a dispute whether 75 or 200 copies had been distributed and they said that in this case that he had gone just a little too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.094" offset="5223737">They said this case of the books distributed by the writer in White against Kimmel is not thought to be comparable with those cases involving publication of lecture notes or the distribution of copies of a minister sermon among the members of his congregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.114" offset="5299806">It is by such assimilation that the trial court endeavors to satisfy the criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.093" offset="5319764">But White, in distributing these books, White does not appear in the record as a teacher or as a propagandist endeavoring to persuade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.234" offset="5356335">He is not pictured as a man with a message.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.457" offset="5369187">I sincerely feel that Rickover is a man with a message.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.779" offset="5386533">If Rickover's speeches had been before Judge Yankwich, he would obviously have decided the case exactly as he did in White against Kimmel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.214" offset="5420178">And I believe, giving due attention to the language as expressed by the Court of Appeals itself that if Rickover speeches had been there involved, the Court of Appeals would not have reversed Yankwich and therefore I commend to you Judge Yankwich's decision in that case and the treatment of it by the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1397.693" offset="5694151">Captain Clark had been enjoined by President Jefferson to keep careful notes and make a report because they realized they were working on the purchase at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.824" offset="5738663">They realized that this would be of great future importance to the country, but what happened was that formal reports were duly sent to Washington, but then these other notes which Judge Nordbye in his beautiful opinion though somewhat long said was the private writings of Lewis.</text>
