            <text syncTime="11.467" offset="149191">Overnight, I have rethought the colloquy I had at the close of yesterday's session with the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.022" offset="179493">The Chief Justice asked what the Government's position would be if the petitioner asked both for the suppression of the narcotics and for the return of the money instead of for just the suppression of the narcotics, and I answered that both would be appealable since the issues as to both would be the same and that proper judicial administration counseled against splitting the two portions of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.140" offset="263920">On reconsideration, it seems to me that my answer was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.704" offset="278235">While in this case, the issues as to the narcotics and the money probably would be identical and therefore, could be decided together.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.542" offset="309582">This would not be true probably in most cases, and in many cases, whether the issues were the same, within -- within in itself be a difficult question which only the Court of Appeals could finally determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.734" offset="358275">And therefore, the Government agrees as was suggested yesterday that each part of the motion under Rule 41 should be treated independently and tested to determine whether it is a part of the criminal case or as an independent proceeding, and this means returning to the Chief Justice's hypothetical case, that the part of the motion denying the return of the money would be appealable by the portion of the motion denying the suppression of narcotics would not be appealable.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.118" offset="3939871">As I listened to my line of adversary, I believe his theory would amount to fragmentary appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.800" offset="3974562">That one part, that in you're going to ask for a suppression of contrabands and you also ask for the return, let's assume that there are papers that implicate the -- the defendant in the sale of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.273" offset="4028479">Now, after those papers in which you ask for a return, you can then have a divisiveness and go to the Court of Appeals upon the illegal seizure of those papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.161" offset="4076022">And I think the whole question here is, is either the contraband or these papers' part or a step in the criminal procedure or proceeding or is it not?</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.403" offset="4120952">That is the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.879" offset="4126908">Now, back in 1930, Judge Learned Hand of our circuit, in an appellate case said, “We hold therefore that at the beginning of the proceeding which determines the appealability of order and that since this was before indictment, we have jurisdiction of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.971" offset="4203290">That's been the law in our circuit for 31 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.337" offset="4216769">And as I point out in my appendix, seven other circuits agreed with Judge Learned Hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.791" offset="4242578">There are seven cases in this Court which more or less adhere to the same philosophy, an addition to the three cases that Judge Whittaker -- Mr. Justice Whittaker mentioned yesterday, we have the Go-Bart case, the Steel case, the Lockwood's case, and, of course, the more recent vintage, the Carroll case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.637" offset="4321886">Now, in the Carroll case, the Court very distinctly stated, earlier cases illustrated sometimes was off discussion that under certain conditions, orders for the suppression or return of illegally seized property are appealable at once as where the motion is made prior to indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.668" offset="4406000">Now, we made our motion prior to indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.436" offset="4417076">And as to this divisiveness, the severance, this theory of fragmentary appeal, this Court in a footnote, I think, thoroughly elucidated the concept of law when it said, “We do not suggest that a motion made under Rule 41 (e) gains or loses appealability simply upon whether it has return or suppression or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.953" offset="4503176">I don't think this Court in the Carroll case, has set a line of demarcation between a return or a suppression.</text>
