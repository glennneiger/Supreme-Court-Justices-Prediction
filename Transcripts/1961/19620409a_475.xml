            <text syncTime="22.795" offset="194539">This is a case in which Robert Elmer Gallegos, the petitioner and by writ of certiorari comes from the Supreme Court of the State of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.696" offset="250128">He was tried in the District Court in the City and County of Denver for a murder during -- train during a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.245" offset="288371">He was jointly charged with Eddie Martinez.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.816" offset="302686">Robert Elmer Gallegos was 14 years of age and Eddie Martinez was 12 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.231" offset="332257">The case against Eddie Martinez during the course of the trial was dismissed because of the fact that the Court ruled that he did not understand the nature of the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.232" offset="384293">The Court further heard the question involving the admissibility of a statement taken at the end of a seven-day period in security and in the Juvenile Hall in the City and County of Denver and determined --</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles S. Vigil</label>
            <text syncTime="98.264" offset="496410">This case started by an investigation by the Denver Police Department as shown in Exhibit G which is part of the record, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.932" offset="555133">And they had apparently picked up at least one other individual prior to the time that surely by accident in accordance with the testimony of the Police Officer Chism who picked up these boys in the lower section of Denver as they were shining shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.065" offset="631620">Police Officer Chism picked them up and the record will show that after picking them up, he immediately took them to Juvenile Hall and the next day, he determined that there were three boys present at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.075" offset="707688">It was Bobby Gallegos, his brother, Charles who was 11 and his brother, Richard who was eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.658" offset="746036">And in accordance with what was done at that time, the police officer interrogated them and the testimony shows that after the interrogation that took place some time during this period probably on the 3rd of January of 1959, that a charge was brought in the Juvenile Court in the City and County of Denver and at that time, the charge that was brought was for the robbery because the victim, Smith, of course, was still living.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles S. Vigil</label>
            <text syncTime="204.099" offset="919803">Yes, in the juvenile court.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.943" offset="927117">In that case, the juvenile judge heard the proceedings and determined that the boys were guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.777" offset="962435">As a matter of fact, the testimony in the District Court carried this forward by stating that they had admitted their guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.421" offset="989080">But in any event, the Court sentenced them to the State Industrial School and when Mr. Smith died, the District Attorney filed a charge in the District Court on the same state of facts except for the one fact that Mr. Smith had died.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.971" offset="1071208">Now, the death certificate showed that Mr. Smith had died from pneumonia, some 30 days after the alleged assault that had occurred on December the 20th of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.056" offset="1119587">The trial occurred on June the 9th of 1959 or started on that day and during the trial, the evidence indicated that the facts were substantially as I've stated them.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.391" offset="1184893">The -- the Attorney General appears to state and I think the Supreme Court os the State of Colorado also fears to state this although no dates were used in the opinion, that immediately upon arrest, that Bobby Gallegos made a statement, however, the record will dispute this.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.149" offset="1287920">The record at page 197 shows that Officer Chism was questioned starting on page 196 at the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.726" offset="1402232">Question, The Court has ruled, you may testify Officer as to the conversation you had with Robert Gallegos on the occasion that is on the evening of January the 1st at 19th in Curtis Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.954" offset="1451238">Answer, He admitted to me the conversation began in regards the assault on Robert F. Smith which I had and I'll then report on and I was investigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.542" offset="1501497">In talking to Robert, he admitted he had a part in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.126" offset="1519888">Question, Did he say what part he had in that?</text>
            <text syncTime="357.878" offset="1534934">Answer, He didn't at first and that is the reason I booked him in Juvenile Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.316" offset="1576626">And then the record follows at page 199.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.676" offset="1998033">The information that I had obtained, I sent a report to juvenile court on this first information.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.814" offset="2022588">And then on January 5th, the victim or the other so identified the parties at Juvenile Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.364" offset="2048815">And at that time, upon taking the other victim home, I was called to Juvenile Hall that Richard wanted to see me.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.167" offset="2080057">That is when he told me about the assault and I sent an additional report to the juvenile court at that time indicating, of course, this was January the 5th when the second assault which involved Robert Smith was called to the attention of Officer Chism.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.563" offset="2165635">Now, we follow on page 208, at the top of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.868" offset="2198862">And of course, that witness was Officer Miller and I might explain here that Officer Chism was the Officer who first arrested these boys, the three boys, who had developed later, were not the boys that he wanted that is all three of them, Charles was released.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.744" offset="2294366">But Officer Miller was the one who took the statement at the police station on the 7th.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.063" offset="2331669">And the question that was asked at that time was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.623" offset="2349850">Question, What was the conversation?</text>
            <text syncTime="563.940" offset="2359150">Answer, I told Robert -- Mr. Smith, I was informed Mr. Smith, who was in critical condition at Denver General Hospital not expected to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.571" offset="2401677">And I told him it was my job to attempt to get a formal statement for the record in a matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.028" offset="2439502">Now, the obvious thing is that the statement on that date was taken on the morning of January the 7th of 1959 that indicates that no statement had been taken prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.599" offset="2501778">Now, the Attorney General also indicates that they were -- these three boys who were picked up, I might point out here also that Eddie Martinez, the 12-year-old, was not picked up until the 2nd of January, although, Robert and Charles and Richard Gallegos had been picked up on the 1st of January.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.780" offset="2626539">But because of the fact that the determination was made to Charles was not in anyway involved, Charles was released and taken home.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.987" offset="2675336">And Eddie Martinez was picked up on the 2nd of January and taken to Juvenile Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.569" offset="2697697">Now the record shows that so far as Eddie Martinez was concerned and I refer now to the record 146, and this witness is testifying, and the Court asked this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.934" offset="2811068">The Court, Then what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="678.515" offset="2817442">The witness, Well, as I say, we heard Eddie.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.341" offset="2836773">The conversation was, “What did you tell that guy?”</text>
            <text syncTime="688.151" offset="2855999">He said, “I told him the truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2637.043" offset="10651564">Well, I don't think that it necessarily it violates any constitutional provision to say that that should be accepted quite frankly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.304" offset="10696600">But at the same time, I feel that that construction is not in conformity with what the law states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.160" offset="10728051">Now, the last point that we have is a point involving the waiver of the jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.730" offset="10762324">We requested to waive a jury trial in this case from any reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.073" offset="10787715">And in the case, we'd also filed a plea of former jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.037" offset="10811538">And the Court overruled this motion to waive a jury trial in the case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.297" offset="10848528">However; on the plea of former jeopardy, the Court heard this plea of former jeopardy without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.576" offset="10885726">Now of course, we did not request the jury nor did we do anything about having the jury in the case, because in that particular plea, although under the cases in Colorado in pleas of former jeopardy, there must be a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.414" offset="10949047">In this particular situation, there was no jury in the plea of former jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.394" offset="10984991">However, when the trial -- on the charge itself came on, the Court insisted that there must be a jury and overruled our motion or a waiver of the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2758.277" offset="11136502">Between 8:30 and 9 p.m. on December 20th, 1958, the defendant who was then 14 years old and two other boys were shining shoes in downtown Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.029" offset="11191463">They weren't making very much money and they thought of a plan, to rob an old man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.984" offset="11211316">The victim that they picked out on the street was partially drunk and they followed him to his hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.648" offset="11237961">But since they lost track of the old man, they left one boy at the door, the youngest one, as a lookout, and the other two went on upstairs and they have asked some people up there if their grandfather had just come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.187" offset="11292087">And the people upstairs said, “Well, the old man next door just came in.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.788" offset="11306506">So they knocked at the indicated door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.795" offset="11314552">And when the man answered, one of the boys asked for a drink of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.871" offset="11334823">The old man then turned around to get the water and the defendant struck him with a shoe brush and he fell right to the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.623" offset="11373902">The two boys together then held a knife on his throat and took his wallet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.097" offset="11395741">They ran downstairs, picked up the lookout at the door and the three of them together ran on to a viaduct where they split up the $13 they found in the wallet, threw the wallet and the shoe brush off the side of the viaduct, it was never -- neither were ever recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.071" offset="11455613">Twelve days later, New Year's night on the 1st of January, 1959, the defendant was questioned by an officer who had a record of this assault and a description of the suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.043" offset="11499499">He immediately admitted he's involvement in this entire incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.366" offset="11516844">The next day, he was booked in at Juvenile Hall, rather that night, he was booked in but the next day, he again admitted he's part of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2900.229" offset="11704299">Now as I state, he again confessed the next day and the officer in the Juvenile Hall took the entire matter down in longhand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.447" offset="11737109">All of the details that I've already related about are in that oral confession he gave the next day to the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.095" offset="11771800">It was on the 7th of January when he signed his first written confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.125" offset="11791862">He at that time affirmed all of the details I've already given and besides that, he affirmed the date as December 20th, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.300" offset="11828537">Now after the attack, the victim was immediately taken to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.221" offset="11844211">He had numerous fractures and bruises on its jaws and cut on his neck.</text>

            <text syncTime="2943.479" offset="11877334">He was reexamined and they found quite a few blood clots which the doctor's testified were secondary to the blows that he received about the base from the shoe brush.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.340" offset="11920697">On the discovering of these blood clots and so forth, they applied additional medications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.242" offset="11948387">They also performed surgery, but the victim did not respond at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.296" offset="11964583">He died on the 26th of January, 1959, some 36 days later -- 35 days later after the initial attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.646" offset="11997915">And the death certificate, it is true as to bronchial pneumonia, that's the cause of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.218" offset="12016201">At the trial, both the doctor and the pathologist testified that the cause of the -- of death was bronchial pneumonia and that the blows about the head and face brought on the bronchial pneumonia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.531" offset="12069491">Apparently, it was somewhat similar to the situation of this fighter that just died.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.084" offset="12083702">They said he died of bronchial pneumonia caused by the blows about the face and the head.</text>

            <text syncTime="3022.384" offset="12192893">He said the written statement was forced out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.783" offset="12206477">But during the presentation in front of the jury, the defendant did not take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.199" offset="12228211">He presented other witnesses in an attempt to establish an alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.818" offset="12246601">The other witnesses testified that the defendant and the other two boys allegedly involved in this affair were all at the home of one of the boys watching television for the entire evening when these all occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.892" offset="12294980">Now, the defendant himself also presented to the Court, the Juvenile Court psychiatrist -- psychologist, pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.805" offset="12322565">And the psychologist said that in his opinion, the defendant had an IQ of 70 regarding his language ability, the ability to communicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.970" offset="12367287">But he said he had an overall of IQ of 83 which was equal to that of the average 10 or 11-year-old.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.954" offset="12399156">The psychologist also said that the defendant had feelings of insecurity and of being retarded and was more prone to suggestions from others than with the normal -- the average person to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.356" offset="12444818">I'd like to point out at this point that in Colorado, once the person is physically 14 years old, his ability -- his mental ability short of insanity is immaterial, I can feel that that was clear for Mr. Vigil's presentation between 10 where -- when they first might be accountable for a crime and 14, their ability to distinguish good from evil is all important and whether or not they're tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.903" offset="12566967">But once they're physically 14 years old, they are accountable unless they're going to plea and show insanity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3136.224" offset="12648260">And being in that group between 10 and 14, this was conclusive factor as to whether or not he knew the difference between right and wrong and could understand the nature of a no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.544" offset="12685563">The psychiatrist said he could not and therefore the case was dropped as Eddie Martinez.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.841" offset="12806771">He examined Gallegos because Mr. Vigil submitted a petition to the Court to have the boys examined by a psychiatrist to aid him in preparing their defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3675.893" offset="14806915">This is shown on pages 1, starting at page 117 and over to 118.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.058" offset="14831574">I'll read the relevant portions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.568" offset="14841605">They said Richard and Robert followed Mr. Smith upstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.789" offset="14858533">And losing him, they inquired to different parties that -- that they were looking for their grandfather.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.970" offset="14883297">One party told them, “The man just next door had come in and it was probably him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.559" offset="14909628">Again, they said, “Eddie stayed downstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.042" offset="14923525">Robert said he knocked on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.555" offset="14933556">Someone told him to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.342" offset="14940766">And when they opened the door, he saw it was the man they were looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.737" offset="14958320">Then he punched the man on the chin with his fist.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.530" offset="14969501">The Court, Who did this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.177" offset="14976084">The witness, Robert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.981" offset="14983293">And he then proceeded to get his bill fold out of his rear pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.355" offset="15012760">Now, I would like to clear up the last paragraph on page 2 of the reply brief, which has come in, in the part about two-thirds all the way down on page 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.746" offset="15054346">So the question here is to which boys were originally picked up and whether their statements that they gave prior to their being put in security in Juvenile Hall were individual statements from each one or whether they were some kind of a combined statement that the police gathered from all three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.009" offset="15119444">Now, it's clear that the three Gallegos brothers were picked up first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.548" offset="15137520">And then Charles, when they found out he was not at all -- all involved was released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.847" offset="15158732">Eddie Martinez was later then picked up but there was no combined statement, the statement obtained and that the police officers testified about him on the stand were individual statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.261" offset="15204394">This had to show somewhat on page 125, near the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.677" offset="15226128">And it shows that the only person who talked about combined statements was the defendant's counsel where he asked the officer, “You combined the statements though.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.494" offset="15265311">You had been questioning them and you combined the statements.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.466" offset="15277223">Answer, No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.005" offset="15283388">After Richard told me what happened when he admitted they were the boys then Robert verified that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.867" offset="15306794">Question, And Richard is the eight-year-old?</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.444" offset="15317138">Answer, Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.194" offset="15324139">“And then Robert, his brother said that was so?</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.058" offset="15335633">Answer, Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.274" offset="15344515">Who was the third boy in the car?</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.961" offset="15351202">Answer, Their brother Charles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.204" offset="15364159">What did Charles have to do with this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.079" offset="15371682">Answer, When we took him to juvenile court, Robert told me he didn't have anything to do with it but Eddie Martinez who lived at 45th in Mariposa was the one that was with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.802" offset="15410552">I think this shows how the three got picked up that they did get individual admissions from each of the two involved Gallegos' brothers, but then they later picked up the other fellow, Eddie Martinez who the Gallegos boys said was also in on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.985" offset="15467290">Now, it was at 8:30 p.m. on the night after he was picked up just about 24 hours later, 2nd of January, that all three gave complete confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.046" offset="15511594">The defendant himself gave the facts which the officer recorded in longhand and which are shown on pages 197 to 199 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.943" offset="15559137">Mr. Vigil starts reading at the top of 197.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.225" offset="15572302">I'd like to go on a little further and show what the officer said on pages 197 through 199, the relevant parts that the defendant had testified -- had admitted to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.139" offset="15619950">He admitted another assault that he took part in another assault on an old man in a hotel at 1851 Champa Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.854" offset="15650774">He did say he didn't strike the old man that he didn't have anything to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.413" offset="15669060">But upon leaving the premises, he proceeded down to 18th in Curtis Street where he was shining shoes that upon seeing an old man who was later identified as Robert F. Smith, he followed him to a hotel on 18th Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.166" offset="15727992">He didn't know the name of the hotel or address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.153" offset="15740008">Question, Did he say he was with them in one?</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.667" offset="15750040">Answer, Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.104" offset="15755786">He told me he was with his younger brother Richard and one Eddie Martinez.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.566" offset="15773654">Question, Alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.738" offset="15778356">Answer, They followed the old man to the hotel and Richard stayed downstairs and watch out for cops.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.327" offset="15804688">He and Eddie went upstairs and they lost track of the old man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.388" offset="15820884">They asked several if they had seen his grandfather come in, that he had just come in and was drunk.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.607" offset="15845752">I'd like to skip down at the bottom of 198 and the story continues there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.243" offset="15864351">He said upon knocking on the other door, someone told him to come in, that he opened the door and he had seen it was the man he was looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.812" offset="15898624">He said at that time, Eddie Martinez asked the old man for a drink of water and when the old man brought the water, Eddie grabbed him and he, Robert, hit the old man about the head and face with the shoe brush.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.421" offset="15949093">That when the old man fell to the floor, he took a knife and held it at the old man's throat and took his bill fold out of his back pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.727" offset="15982320">Question, Did he say what they then did?</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.724" offset="15990262">Answer, He said, they all left in and went to the 23rd Street viaduct where he gave Eddie $3 and they kept $10 to split between him and Richard and they then went home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.366" offset="16040835">That he threw the billfold and the brush over the 23rd Street viaduct which was never located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.144" offset="16063927">Now, I make it so hard to read this record and say that this boy did not give an oral confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.475" offset="16093288">I don't know what else more this boy could've told that officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.878" offset="16110843">He obviously confessed everything there was to confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.051" offset="16127561">Before he was even placed in the confinement, which the counsel now alleges was the -- the cause of a later coerced confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.351" offset="16160789">Notice that he had already thoroughly admitted the entire thing before they even alleged that the coercion had begun.</text>

            <text syncTime="6206.447" offset="24929155">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6210.670" offset="24946082">In this matter, there were several statements taken that were written and I have previously referred to Exhibit G.</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.230" offset="25000312">This Exhibit G is dated on January the 3rd of 1959 and was signed by two officers who were assigned to this case, J.S. Riggs being one of the detectives and P.O. Chism, being the other one, and P.O. Chism is the principle witness that the District Attorney relied upon to carry forth the case and sat beside the District Attorney during the whole trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.580" offset="25145657">And P.O. Chism is the man who testifies and whose testimony I have previously alluded at page 197 in complete contradiction to the statement of the Attorney General in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6276.343" offset="25208769">Because at page 197, Chism states, as I've stated before, “Did he say what part he had in it?” That's the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6289.050" offset="25259551">And the answer, He didn't at first and that is the reason I booked him in Juvenile Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="6296.489" offset="25289331">So obviously, Chism didn't get any statement in any automobile from Robert Gallegos.</text>
            <text syncTime="6302.755" offset="25314408">That's the unqualified statement of the District Attorney's witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6308.070" offset="25335620">And the other statement that we have referred to is the fact that the officers on January the 3rd were listening over the microphones and on that date, because Richard hadn't apparently told the truth about what happened as the testimony shows and Eddie Martinez was beating him up.</text>
            <text syncTime="6331.700" offset="25430183">So obviously, they had not secured any statement until (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="6341.724" offset="25470307">And so they had a statement at that time, what was the purpose of all of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="6345.866" offset="25486817">But more than that, Eddie Martinez was beating up Richard because he had made a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6352.394" offset="25512939">Now, Exhibit 3 or Exhibit G, I should say, with just the Exhibit that I have pointed out is one in which the detectives point out that the -- they are checking two offenses that apparently occurred by their own exhibit and this is in their handwriting on December the 19th and not December the 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.952" offset="25623176">Now, there's been some question here with reference to what does release from security mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="6385.912" offset="25647000">Well, security in the Juvenile Hall is putting a boy in a room alone where he cannot see anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="6394.942" offset="25683153">That's the testimony in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6396.994" offset="25691303">And of course, releasing from security means simply that when he's released from security, he's permitted to mingle around with the other boys and participate in the activities of the Juvenile Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="6408.539" offset="25737488">Now, the officers knew and the record substantiates this that when they took a boy to Juvenile Hall that he was immediately placed in security for at least 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="6421.031" offset="25787538">And of course when we talk about what is solitary, I would like to know what solitary is, how do you define solitary?</text>
            <text syncTime="6427.669" offset="25814079">Does that mean that you put him in a dark room or you kept in the dungeon of some kind?</text>
            <text syncTime="6433.105" offset="25835813">I don't think that's contemplated at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6435.578" offset="25845635">Solitary and we all know this from any military experience very often as merely being put in a room where you can't communicate with anybody and that's all what it means to anyone I'm sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6446.651" offset="25889938">And of course in this case when we have children, you have a child, eight years old, one 12 and one 14 and they're all kept in solitary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6454.951" offset="25923166">More than that, the officers are listening over microphones to get statements that they might make.</text>

            <text syncTime="6469.305" offset="25980635">They brought Richard downstairs at Juvenile Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="6472.477" offset="25993279">The Juvenile Hall is a building where juveniles are kept and it has two floors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6481.727" offset="26030268">Apparently, they brought Richard downstairs because they think the officers states that Richard had sent word to him that he wanted to talk to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6490.199" offset="26064123">Well of course when he came out, they brought Richard downstairs and they talked to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="6948.522" offset="27897501">Answer, I don't believe I could pick it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6951.823" offset="27910666">So I think that shows quite clearly that these exhibits, so far as A, B, and C which were the original statements were combined information which is what we have stated from all three of these boys.</text>
            <text syncTime="6965.195" offset="27964165">And the first statement that was taken was taken from the eight-year-old and the record shows that this was taken on January the 3rd after he had been kept in solitary confinement for a period of at least two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="6980.620" offset="28025814">Now, there's no question that this boy was taken from the streets of Denver and here again, there's an important point.</text>
