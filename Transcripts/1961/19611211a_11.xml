            <text syncTime="72.398" offset="392965">When he appeared in response to the subpoena on March 19, 1956, he found sitting as the sole member of the Subcommittee Senator Eastland.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.854" offset="434761">And, he was interrogated for some hours in the afternoon of that day, first, in closed executive session for about five minutes, and then an open public session for about, I think, an hour-and-a half to two hours by Senator Eastland, the sole member of the subcommittee sitting throughout the entire session, and by Robert Morris who, at that time, was Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.559" offset="525563">He answered numerous questions put to him with respect to his educational and employment background.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.228" offset="548237">He refused, however, to answer 15 questions, including inquiries as to whether he was then a Communist and whether he had, at any time in the past, been a member of the Communist Party insisting that, in light of the scriptures of the First Amendment, the subcommittee had no authority or power to inquire into his personal and private affairs, into his political beliefs, or into his associational activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.182" offset="652100">When he was asked whether he was relying on the Fifth Amendment, he expressly disclaimed any reliance on the privilege against self-incrimination accorded by that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.139" offset="687940">For his refusal to answer the 15 questions, he was indicted for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.732" offset="706330">He filed a motion to dismiss similar in nature to the motion which was filed in each of the preceding cases argued to this Court, a motion, in part, putting an issue of a question as to the competence of the grand jury and other questions which have been argued to Your Honors here this last week and this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.476" offset="781249">The motion to dismiss, like the other motions in the other cases, was denied in all respects.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.906" offset="815000">He was convicted, fined, and sentenced to three months imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.192" offset="832136">We urge reversal of the judgment of conviction on each of the grounds which we have set forth in the eight divisions in the argument of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.385" offset="860871">We cannot, of course, in this half-hour argue orally each one of those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.847" offset="882709">With the Court's permission and to the extent time permits, I should like, therefore, to address myself just to two of the grounds on which we rely for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.555" offset="921579">First, it's our contention that petitioner here, in this case, was denied an opportunity adequately to cross-examine and to make a full defense with respect to the issue which has, here, been called the issue of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.211" offset="988244">I think it's now in plain view of the briefs filed by the government and in view of the oral arguments made by government counsel in this Court this last week that whatever the quarrel may be between the government and the petitioners here as to the assimilation of Fourth Amendment criteria to cases of this kind, whatever their quarrel may be as to the quantum of proof necessary to prove probable cause, as we have termed the issue, that the government now concedes that it is the duty of the government to make a showing and the duty of the Courts to consider in striking the balance which this Court says must be struck between the private interest and the public interest involved, it's the duty of the Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="1372.167" offset="5592064">We, however, are urging that the government concedes that, in order to effect this balancing process, in order that a balance which this Court says must be struck, the trial court must consider what it was that was so important to the Committee which caused it to call this witness to ask him questions generally deemed to invade First Amendment areas and, when he refused to answer them, to submit him to the Courts for punishment for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.329" offset="5708675">As I read this Court's opinions, the majority opinions in this Court, this Court has said the trial court must strike that balance because, unless it strikes that balance, we're in danger of having first -- the rights generally deemed protected under the First Amendment unjustly invaded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.281" offset="7692518">Now, the two basic questions that are raised and that I do hope to be able to cover in the time available are, first, the basis for the Committee's -- subcommittee's calling the petitioner and, second, the extent to which a subject under inquiry and the pertinency of the questions to that subject were adequately established and proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.270" offset="7800456">Now, the question of the basis for calling the petitioner has been raised here in the context of the trial court's limitation on the right of petitioner's counsel to cross-examine concerning the identity of confidential informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.470" offset="7869210">Now, I think it's very important to realize the context in which that particular question first arose in this case originally at the trial, and I might say that there was no question of the Committee's basis for calling petitioner raised at the hearing, at trial, the only question that was raised with respect to acquiring this information on which the Committee based its calling of petitioner was petitioner's contention that the Committee already had all of the information that it sought to obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.095" offset="8023751">In other words, that its calling of petitioner was a vain act, not that the subcommittee didn't have any basis for calling him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.259" offset="8060426">Quite the contrary, that it had all of this basis and didn't really need to know anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.256" offset="8088430">Now, we argued in our brief and we do contend that this would be no defense since the subcommittee does have a legitimate interest in confirming its information in determining whether or not the informants that have given it this information are reliable and in establishing a foundation for asking further questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.109" offset="8183829">However, after the trial level, the petitioner is now raising this question as to the basis for the subcommittee's calling petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.170" offset="8224057">We point out, first, of course, that this is, we submit, fatally inconsistent with his prior contention that the subcommittee already had all of the information that it sought answers on, and I might say that's at page 128 of the joint appendix where that statement appears in the trial record.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. William Doolittle, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2424.432" offset="9801122">I argue that the first point that petitioner has raised in that concerns the Committee's basis for calling the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.680" offset="9838111">After subcommittee counsel had testified to the effect that I have referred to and as set forth on pages 4 and 5 of our brief, he submitted to cross-examination on a number of aspects of that information such as, as counsel has pointed out, the reliability of the informants and the form in which the information was received, that is to say, whether it was oral or written, circumstances in which it was received, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.436" offset="9965066">And, it did appear from the record, there's no indication to the contrary, that the Court would've allowed further questioning along these general lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.629" offset="10005922">The line was drawn at compromising confidential informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.182" offset="10028074">Now, I would like to point out that the types of information that were brought out in this case and the form in which the information was brought out in this case is the same as it was in the Barenblatt case, that is to say, it is the same type of information, the same form that the Court relied on to rebut the proposition that the witness was called as a result of indiscriminate dragnet procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.567" offset="10157641">Now, in this case, as in so many of these cases, the contention is again raised that the subject under inquiry by the subcommittee when the petitioner appeared was not sufficiently set forth at that time and was not proved by the government at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.301" offset="10224619">And, here again, it is not so much contended that there were no indications of subject matter but, rather, there were too many such indications and that they were inconsistent with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.691" offset="10270177">I think it is very appropriate in these circumstances to consider briefly why it is important to identify a subject under inquiry, and also, to consider the character that a subject under inquiry may assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.808" offset="10338617">Of course the primary reasons for identification of a subject under inquiry by an investigating committee are essentially practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.316" offset="10368606">A witness, in deciding whether or not to answer each question, needs to know the subject under inquiry at that time so that he can reach a judgment, on the one hand, as to whether that subject is within the Committee's general investigating authority and, on the other, as to whether the particular question that he's trying to decide whether to answer or not is pertinent to that subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.842" offset="10462751">What I want to emphasize is that the proper focus for this must necessarily have been the witness' focus is upon the relationship that each question bears to what the subject under inquiry was, at the time of the question was asked, and what the witness understood it to be at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.128" offset="10547911">Now, as a practical matter, the subjects under inquiry by a subcommittee with investigatory authority as extensive, and yet, as interrelated as that of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee are bound to develop essentially in layers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.662" offset="10609977">There is no question but that the Internal Security Subcommittee of the Senate had been engaged for a number of years in one basic investigation with a single central theme, and that is the investigation of com -- of the Communist organization and activities in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.702" offset="10678209">And, in a very real sense, that is always a subject under inquiry, against which the subcommittee's questions may be properly judged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.404" offset="10709034">However, as much for convenience and efficiency as for any other reason, the subcommittee will often conduct hearings focused upon a narrower aspect of that basic subject, a lesser included subject under inquiry, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.264" offset="10776430">A good example of this is the three-day set of hearings that the subcommittee held on Communist infiltration into news media which is involved in the Shelton, Whitman, and Price cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.490" offset="10821360">Not infrequently, however, the breakdown within the basic subject under inquiry will coincide not with a group of witnesses in one trade or profession but with a single witness, thus, in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.270" offset="10876426">The subcommittee was pursuing as a part of its basic subject under inquiry, which was Communist organization and activities in the United States, generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.064" offset="10907669">The more specific subject on which it had reason to believe that petitioner had information was recent revisions in Communist organization and Communist activities in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.136" offset="10951868">And, finally, the subject under inquiry may be, and often is, narrowed down even more for the purposes of asking a specific single question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.914" offset="10991052">The present case provides an excellent example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.889" offset="11002964">Prior to asking the petitioner whether he had contributed funds to the Communist Party, the Chairman informed him that the subcommittee wish to know how the Party was financed, thus, establishing a subject under inquiry for that one particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.672" offset="11062105">And, this illustrates what I mean when I say that the subject under inquiry often manifests itself in layers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.271" offset="11088436">When this last question was asked, the basic subject under inquiry was Communist activities generally, within which, the witness was being questioned on the narrower subject of organizational revisions and activities in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.281" offset="11140472">And then, for the purpose of this one question, the subject was expressly narrowed to Party finances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.935" offset="11167117">Now, it is, of course, this stratification of greater and lesser included subjects under inquiry that explain some of the statements by the prosecutor and by subcommittee counsel at trial, suggesting a broad subject of inquiry in terms of Communist activities generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.581" offset="11237648">Those statements, however, were in no way inconsistent with, nor did they in any way change what the government's evidence showed, the subject under inquiry to have been and what the petitioner understood it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.249" offset="11296371">Now, I should like, very briefly, to review the evidence that did establish what the subject under inquiry was in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.191" offset="11328136">On March 19, 1956, the petitioner appeared before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee very briefly in executive session but, upon his refusal to answer to questions concerning Communist associations, he was temporarily excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.844" offset="11390725">Shortly thereafter, on the same day, he was called before the subcommittee in open session.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.178" offset="11416116">Before he was asked any questions, subcommittee counsel read a statement by the Chairman setting forth the purposes of the hearing and the critical portion of that statement was this paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.998" offset="11467316">“We shall try to determine to what extent Soviet power operates through the Communist Party here and to what extent other organizations have been devised to effectuate its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.894" offset="11506918">We shall study the structural revisions that the Communists have made in their network in order to avoid detection, and endeavor to trace the movement of individual agents through these changing structures.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.311" offset="11548609">Petitioner was then asked, and answered, a number of questions about his current employment in New Orleans and about his previous employment in New York and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.390" offset="11588942">Then, subcommittee counsel, after stating that the Committee had information that petitioner and his wife had been instructed by the Communist Party to avoid formal party associations when they went south, made this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.990" offset="11643382">“The purpose of subpoenaing this witness and asking him the following questions is to determine to what extent Mr. Liveright's activities have been carried out in New Orleans in the framework of a Communist Party and to what extent they have been carried out in some other framework.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.789" offset="11702523">Petitioner was then asked and refused to answer questions as to whether he was then a Communist or whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party, and these refusals form the basis for counts three and four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.213" offset="11752260">Then, the Chairman, after noting that we are tracing the activities of the Communist Party in United States, made this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.753" offset="11782353">“Our information is, sir, that you are sent south and placed there with your wife on a mission for the Communist Party and were told by your superiors not to become involved with the Communist cell that was a professional group in the City of New Orleans, but the word was used by your superiors to stay clean.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.633" offset="11853928">The Chairman then asked petitioner the questions that form the basis for counts five through seven, whether he was sent on a mission for the Party into the south, whether he had affiliated with the Communist cell in New Orleans composed of professional people, and whether Communist meetings had been held in his home in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.192" offset="11928116">Then, after petitioner was asked and refused to answer question about being membership director of a named unit in the Communist Party, the Chairman stated that the subcommittee desired to know how the Communist conspiracy was financed and that it had information that petitioner had given money to the Communist Party on various occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.689" offset="12010141">Petitioner refused to state whether this was true, and this refusal forms the basis for count 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.739" offset="12034278">Then, petitioner was asked the questions on which counts 10 through 14 are based.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.202" offset="12052146">This concerned mainly certain activities in New York, the holding of Communist meetings in his home in New Orleans, when he joined the Communist Party, and whether he had been told by the Communist leadership to stay clean in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.309" offset="12104600">Thus, as the Court of Appeals found, and that's at page 8 of the record, not only was the subject under inquiry spelled out at the beginning of the open session to be “structural revisions that the Communists have made in their network to avoid detection and the movement of individual agents through these changing structures,” but it was further refined by a specific statement that the subcommittee wish to determine the extent to which petitioner had been sent south to carry out Communist activities on an undercover basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.343" offset="12232704">And then, each of several series of questions was preceded by a careful explanation of the way in which the questions were pertinent to the announced subject under inquiry, although most of them were pertinent on their face and these matters, of course, were established at trial by the government's introduction of the transcript into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.330" offset="12316714">Now, since petitioner did not raise the subject of the subject under inquiry or the pertinency of the questions asked, we contend that it is not open to him to contend that he was not up apprised of these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.554" offset="12369586">His objection, which was a lengthy legal statement comparable to that involved in the Barenblatt case, expressed only his objection to being questioned on his political beliefs and his associational activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.515" offset="12421413">The only mention of pertinency, like in Barenblatt, was that he might wish to challenge the pertinency of the question of the investigation, and that's a type of objection that was expressly held in Barenblatt to be ineffective to raise a pertinency objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.041" offset="12487555">Furthermore, however, it is plain that the petitioner was aware of the subject under inquiry and of the pertinency of the subject's -- of the questions to that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.365" offset="12528828">Prior to his appearance at these hearings, his counsel called the subcommittee counsel who informed him in general terms as to the subject matter of the inquiry, and counsel indicated that he understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.153" offset="12580028">The same counsel represented petitioner at the hearings themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.429" offset="12593089">He did not indicate that there was any variance between the subject disclosed to him in advance and that actually inquired into by the subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.169" offset="12632064">Petitioner, of course, heard the repeated explanatory statements at the hearings by the Chairman and by subcommittee counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.445" offset="12665187">And, we submit that there cannot possibly have been any question in his mind as to what was being inquired into and how the questions were in fact pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.846" offset="12718791">Counsel, in his brief, has also raised several other questions and I should like to deal with as many of them as I can within the time available to me and, as to the remainder, we will of course rely on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.165" offset="12796008">The first of these contentions is that the Senate Resolution, under which this subcommittee was operating, was unduly vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.837" offset="12834670">Now, the authority of this subcommittee to act arose out of Senate Resolution 366 of the Eighty-First Congress, and that's set forth in the petitioner's brief in this case at pages 50 and 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.948" offset="12891199">Actually, there's a paragraph or two that is not included there, but I'll refer to that a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.188" offset="12916172">In each subsequent session, that basic resolution has been readopted and, in this case, the Senate Resolution that readopted the one that was in effect at the time of this hearings was Senate Resolution 174 of the Eighty-Fourth Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.923" offset="12991091">Now, as a whole, we submit that this resolution, Senate Resolution 366, and the precise terms are repeated in 174, that their terms are very much clearer than the House Un-American Activities Committee charter which was considered in both the Watkins and the Barenblatt cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.722" offset="13074265">And, the Rule 11 of the House which was involved in those cases is set forth in our brief in this case on page 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.482" offset="13121285">But, specifically, this -- Senate Resolution 366 and 174 specifically authorize an investigation into “infiltration by persons who are or may be under the domination of the foreign government or organizations controlling the World Communist Movement or any other movement seeking to overthrow the Government of the United States by force and violence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.004" offset="13219401">And, we submit that that is a very clear and specific authorization for the conduct of this particular investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.622" offset="13249912">However, that should not be thought to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.874" offset="13266840">Like House Rule 11, this resolution -- series of resolutions, indeed, comes to us with a persuasive gloss of legislative history that shows that the Senate did authorize investigations of Communist activities in this country like the ones that are involved in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.239" offset="13344371">To use the same factors that the Court cited in the Barenblatt case in discussing the legislative gloss of House Rule 11, first, this subcommittee has devoted most of its energies to investigating Communist activities in various phases of American life, and those hearings are set forth in our brief in this case at pages 26 and 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.532" offset="13441546">The Senate has repeatedly continued the life of the subcommittee at each Congress, and the resolutions that do that are set forth in pages 27 and 28 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.594" offset="13481775">The Senate has never narrowed the authority of the subcommittee and the Senate has continually supported it with substantial appropriations and those by the same resolutions that I have referred to, cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.216" offset="13540185">Now, the contention is also made that this subcommittee could not act, at the time that it was questioning petitioner, because the Senate was in session.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.089" offset="13587728">Section 134 (c) of the Legislative Reorganization Act provides that Committees shall not sit while the Senate is in session without special leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.808" offset="13630568">Now, we contend, first, that this claim is not open to the petitioner because he did not object at the hearing when, if something was to be done about this, it could've been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.113" offset="13675813">He did not inquire as to whether this problem was present, and we submit that it is not now open to him to raise the objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.028" offset="13711444">However, we submit, too, that in any event, Section 134 (c) is a procedural limitation for the benefit of Congress alone in order to secure attendance at its various sessions and that, in any event, it was not intended to confer any rights upon witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.023" offset="13791483">Finally, Section 2 of Senate Resolution 366, which is set forth at page 3 of our brief in this case, expressly gave the subcommittee authority to sit and act at such places and times during the sessions, recesses, and adjourned periods of the Senate as it deemed advisable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.643" offset="13885942">Thirdly, the contention on the subject of the authority of the subcommittee is raised that counts one and two are invalid because the executive session at which they were asked was not authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.202" offset="13948217">Section 133 of the Legislative Reorganization Act requires that there'd be a majority vote of a subcommittee to authorize executive sessions, and it is to that provision that petitioner is referring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.781" offset="14006523">Here, again, we contend that this point is not open to the petitioner because he did not raise it at the hearings when it could've been corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.626" offset="14049886">However, we do submit that it is unnecessary to resolve this question one way or the other since it does affect only 2 of the 14 counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.252" offset="14084368">On the basis of which, petitioner was convicted since he was given a general sentence that is less than he could've received on any one count.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.647" offset="14117909">His sentence must be confirmed if any one count is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.482" offset="14145285">Next, I should like to touch briefly on the point of government employees being on the grand and petit juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.759" offset="14194395">Government counsel in the Russell case has stated the government's basic position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.505" offset="14217383">That is, that in order to challenge an indictment on this ground, there must be an allegation of specific and convincing evidence of strong bias on the part of individual grand jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.905" offset="14267016">Now, the affidavit, on the basis of which petitioner did make the challenge that he made, does not, unfortunately, appear on the record here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4097.635" offset="16493902">Mr. Morris, at the trial, testified that there was some such information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.228" offset="16516263">We sought to cross-examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.162" offset="16523995">We sought to get it by subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.731" offset="16534340">We sought to get it by direction from the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.982" offset="16543326">We were denied any opportunity to cross-examine as to the information or to get it by direction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.578" offset="16565687">We did not waive our rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.973" offset="16571225">At page 117 of the joint appendix, appears our request made to the Court after Mr. Morris testified that he'd be directed to bring the information in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.577" offset="16609677">The Court denied that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.328" offset="16616678">We said we wanted the information in order to test the veracity of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.912" offset="16639039">Mr. Morris' veracity could not be tested by us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.446" offset="16653145">Now, in response -- with reference to Mr. Justice Whittaker's reference last week to the Draper and Caroll cases, let me make it plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.005" offset="16683342">That, had the unnamed informant been named, had we then had an opportunity to call him, it may well be that we could not have asked Mr. X anything relating to the truth of the information he had presumably given Mr. Morris.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.328" offset="16736632">It may well be that the competence of that information as proof of guilt, if it were, of the petitioner might not have been brought in issue, but we certainly should've been permitted an opportunity to test whether in fact Mr. Morris was telling the truth, whether in fact there was such information communicated to him by telephone and in meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.836" offset="16818761">And, if there was some information, we should've been given an opportunity to find out from Mr. X, the unnamed informant, whether this was the Liveright whom he mentioned when he talked to Mr. Morris, whether perhaps it wasn't another Liveright that he had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.158" offset="16879992">This is what we were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.781" offset="16886471">We were denied an opportunity to test the existence and the reliability of the information presumably given to the subcommittee, not its competence as proof of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.811" offset="16938611">Now, if we are not going to be given that right, if petitioners in these cases are not going to be accorded that right, then any investigation of any person can be justified merely on the ipso dixit of a Chief Counsel of a Subcommittee and of the self-serving avowal by a Committee that its investigation is legitimate and bona fide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.430" offset="17021053">There is no other way we know of making a showing such as today, for the first time, not on their briefs, the government would impose on petitioners a strong and substantial showing that there was no basis for the calling of this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.259" offset="17076433">We don't have a case here, such as Mr. Shelton fortunately had, where someone had crossed out the name Willard and written in the name Robert.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.840" offset="17110706">We have a case here where the subpoena was directed toward Herman Liveright.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.402" offset="17125021">Unless we are given an opportunity to test the veracity of the government's witness who testified in chief to test whether in fact there was such information in existence, a fundamental question, we are being denied the rights accorded all defendants in all criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.408" offset="17197014">Now, turning to the question of subject matter under inquiry, here again, as Mr. Fanelli made it clear, it was the case in Russell, we have a shifting of the nature of subject matter under inquiry from stage to stage of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.616" offset="17253857">And, for the first time in this Court, we find the definition of delineation of subject matter that you'll find in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.189" offset="17280084">You'll see it nowhere else below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.212" offset="17288234">In the Court of Appeals, the government counsel took the position that this was part of the investigation into the Communist infiltration into the Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.097" offset="17319790">Here, the government, apparently, abandons that suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.195" offset="17332120">In the trial court, the government prosecutor said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.689" offset="17350092">He said the powers this Committee had on the business it was investigating was the entire breadth of its powers under Resolution 366, and at no time has this since been narrowed down to any particular subject such as a topic or a particular geographic location or a particular and narrower activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.230" offset="17424280">There is no such thing as a matter under inquiry, anything more narrow than the full powers of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.824" offset="17450715">That was the testimony of Mr. Morris that apparently was the ruling of the trial court because the trial court did not particularize as to any subject matter, although it found the indictment questions pertinent to the “subject matter under inquiry before the Committee at that time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.877" offset="17514872">We then are brought back, inevitably, to Resolution 366, this broad resolution, this vast resolution about which I know no better characterization than that offered by one of the champions of this subcommittee -- the Internal Security Subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.928" offset="17583104">Its former Chairman, Senator Jenner, who certainly knows, more than I do, what the subcommittee was engaging in, in the years when Senator Jenner was a member and a Chairman of the subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.295" offset="17624586">And, Senator Jenner, on the Floor of the House, as we quote him in our brief, had this to say about the powers of this subcommittee, about the Resolution 366.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.125" offset="17663875">He said Resolution 366 authorizes the subcommittee to look after the Internal Security of the United States, but it must be realized that it is hard to draw a line indicating where the subject begins and where it ends, and I suggest that if Senator Jenner, a --</text>

            <text syncTime="4412.784" offset="17754467">I don't know at what page but this is 100 Congressional Record 843.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.812" offset="17770663">And, if Senator Jenner, himself, could not determine where the subject began and where it ended, I suggest that Mr. Herman Liveright, a mere layman, likewise, should not be required to have determine where the subject began or where it ended and I suggest that a trial court, in measuring the necessity for calling a witness before it as against his rights to remain silent, could not determine where the subject began and where it ended, particularly when the government refused to say at the trial.</text>
