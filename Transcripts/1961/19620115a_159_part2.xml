            <text syncTime="3888.186" offset="15656103">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.192" offset="15676165">In summarizing what I've already said, may I state the question emerging in this case, is not essentially whether an insanity defense may be forced upon a recalcitrant and competent defendant with a view of spearing him life or loss of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.483" offset="15745337">The question is whether an insanity defense may be forced upon a recalcitrant and competent defendant with the view to depriving him of his liberty without adequate safeguards and I respectfully submit that the safeguards emerging from the situation confronting this Court were not adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.407" offset="15829034">The government concedes that there was no formal notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.885" offset="15842931">The opportunity to defend effectively, in terms of psychiatric assistance was nonexistent and the standard of proof was clearly and explicitly that of reasonable doubt, and reasonable doubt alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.700" offset="15914193">There was no finding that petitioner was insane as of the time he was committed and, when committed, he was committed under circumstances that made his release subject to an onerous oppressive and, I submit, unconstitutional standard, a matter which is not all together relevant in considering his present plight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.167" offset="16011995">The hypothetical situation applied by the Chief Justice strikes me as precisely the situation which would become common place if the Lynch rule were to be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.433" offset="16057135">We've suggested that the application of the Lynch doctrine would enable the prosecution to assert by no means implosively that almost any traffic violation was attributable to the tension generated by a mild and perhaps a very widespread mental disorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.604" offset="16125785">Such assertion backed by evidence presenting no more than a reasonable doubt concerning the mental health of a defendant as of the time of that violation would result in the commitment of that defendant to Saint Elizabeths Hospital for an indefinite period of time and one might add without any assurance of adequate treatment because the Court of Appeals in Auburn against Overholser declared the question of the adequacy of psychiatric treatment at Saint Elizabeths to be a matter of legislative and not a judicial concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.644" offset="16261935">I conclude, with the observation of a legal publicist, undoubtedly known to this Court, Aristotle observed long ago that punishment is a sort of medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.884" offset="16306866">We have considerable cause today to observe that medicine can be a sort of punishment sans due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.976" offset="16343228">The use of medicine as punishment now calls for the correcting hand of this Court.</text>
