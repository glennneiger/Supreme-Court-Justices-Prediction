            <text syncTime="8.419" offset="137070">I'd like to point out another basic problem raised by the lower court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.342" offset="172701">The Court will observe that 301 is not limited to suits between employers and labor unions, but also provides for the enforcement of contracts between labor unions themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.601" offset="249814">The court of course disregarded that feature and in no ways seemed to be troubled by that aspect, but to me, it is a clear expression that Congress intended to cover the entire field of labor contracts which in anyway contribute to stability in Labor Affairs and indicated a broad concept must be given to the term labor contracts, and it was not to be a limited application and that it seems to me was quite indicative by the fact that Congress covered contracts between labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.281" offset="444479">Another difficulty with the lower court's opinion, if I haven't said enough, is that the lower court would provide that every suit for the enforcement of a contract would inevitably raise a representation question as to whether or not, the union suing or being sued was in fact the bargaining agent and this --</text>

            <text syncTime="132.188" offset="632142">Well, if the -- if in fact it is a jurisdictional concept as the lower court holds, that you must be the exclusive bargaining agent, then jurisdiction cannot be granted surely by words, saying you are the exclusive bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.056" offset="715630">At least this is one of the problems which has raised because you -- mind you, we're talking about --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="157.912" offset="735065">I have difficulty with it (Inaudible).</text>

            <label>Mr. S.g. Lippman</label>
            <text syncTime="158.437" offset="737155">-- yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.190" offset="740080">I have difficulty with that too and -- but this is the problem which was raised and every enforcement proceeding could very well become converted into a representation proceeding to term with in fact, and of course this would definitely be in derogation of the Labor Board's processes to exclusively determine representation questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.183" offset="840077">It seems to me that Congress was not concerned with any of these problems, but Congress was concerned with the idea of placing sanctions and behind agreements which carrying out any national labor policy and this is the way to settle disputes and if the federal court should be open to enforce these agreements and it was -- and it is a broad statute in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.956" offset="971212">The lower court in no respect paid heed to what I believed to be national policy, which I believe is important in determining the scope of 301 questions of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.274" offset="1036518">It made no reference to Lincoln Mills or Steelworkers cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.332" offset="1056684">It made no reference to the preamble of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.220" offset="1072253">It made no reference to the Norris-LaGuardia provisions and the policies involved there, encouraging the peaceful adjustment of disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.431" offset="1117080">It made no record -- it made no reference to Title II of the Labor Act which sets up this entire complicated mediation and conciliation machinery, all devised to bring parties together to end labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.323" offset="1176639">Indeed, it did not consider the concept of labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.736" offset="1190327">It was a very narrow -- very narrow approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.795" offset="1210598">I would like -- for the next few minutes to meet and anticipate some of the arguments which I believe my opponent will raise to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.688" offset="1254170">When I, as he stated this brief, he takes the position that the stipulation which the parties entered into had a provision in it in which the parties agreed that there was no collective bargaining on an individual store basis and this demonstrates that in fact there was no collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.335" offset="1356675">Of course, it is conveniently overlooked that the last part of the stipulation provides that nothing herein shall exclude the courts from finding that the strike settlement agreement was in fact a collective bargaining agreement as to why the -- as to why there was any provision, respecting individual collective bargaining, I think is a matter of speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.460" offset="1461164">The explanation perhaps is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.845" offset="1470777">In fact there was no individual bargaining, they bargained on a multiple employer basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.527" offset="1493452">The strike settlement was not negotiated with any particular individual employer, but was negotiated with several employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.301" offset="1524590">But in any event, I believe it is quite clear that what we have before us is a collective bargaining agreement and I think that the stipulation itself, the very last paragraph there, clearly indicates that nothing in the stipulation was to preclude the courts from finding that this was a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.004" offset="1611421">In that respect, I refer to page 41 of the transcript where it is specifically set forth saying, “Nothing in this paragraph is to preclude the courts from finding that the settlement of December 24th, 1958 was a collective bargaining agreement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="401.317" offset="1708596">Again, I think this whole concept of what is a collective bargaining agreement is not specifically defined and I don't think it has any particular real meaning in terms of the problem before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.982" offset="1759274">The other question which I would like to discuss because I think it was raised in the respondent's brief is the Bernhard-Altmann problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.547" offset="1805563">Respondent believes that what we are seeking here is exclusive bargaining rights because there was appended to the strike settlement agreement, the terms and conditions which were operative in the store and the court in Bernhard-Altmann struck down an exclusive bargaining contract where in fact the union did not represent a majority of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.693" offset="1934190">I believe that Bernhard-Altmann is in no respect applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.267" offset="1956446">One, I refer back to my previous argument of the basic distinction between enforcement of contracts under 301 and unfair labor practices which is another proposition when the Court enforces contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.853" offset="2014751">It is not adjudicating in any respect, in any matter as an unfair labor practice but enforcing a provision of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.668" offset="2050069">Of course in the enforcement of the contract, as this Court has pointed out in Lincoln Mills, once the court assumes jurisdiction or search jurisdiction, it questionably will take in to consideration all aspects of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.473" offset="2117256">But Bernhard-Altmann, if it were to arise at all, would arise only after the court has taken jurisdiction in a situation perhaps where we were seeking to enforce the contract as a whole as an exclusive bargaining agent, and not in any situation where we are seeking as matter of -- as matter of an arbitration award to reinstatement of two strikers, and the right of the union representatives to obtain access for the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.716" offset="2242226">I believe the Bernhard-Altmann decision makes it clear that device in that case was exclusive bargaining feature and but for that, the contract of course would have been a members only contract or would have been limited and would not create any difficulty.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.634" offset="2361866">Respondent has suggested this cause is in the moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.513" offset="2373465">It is true, that following the institution of the lawsuit, three local unions who are members of a council, merged with the council into a single local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.034" offset="2439502">They merged and took the name of Local 924 I believe is the name of the new local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.568" offset="2473671">In fact, the local unions maintain their distinct identity as divisions within local 924.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.289" offset="2524557">They hold separate meetings, they have separate officers, they maintain the same employees, all rights and obligations have been assumed and are carried out, and all obligations are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.278" offset="2588505">What was involved was purely an internal maneuver, an internal operation within the unions where instead of having three local unions affiliated with the council, the council was abolished and the three local unions became one, but they maintain their complete identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.217" offset="2668231">The membership is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.488" offset="2677321">They're operating as separate divisions and in all respects, they are in a position to carry on, and are carrying on all collective bargaining relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.482" offset="2725282">It is pure -- it was purely an internal operation, and in no respect having any kind of an impact so far as outside relations were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.256" offset="2764361">We point out in brief that this Court had met the same problem in number of -- in a number of instances and has overruled any suggestion of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.001" offset="2811382">At best, you have a successorship where the successor assumed in all respects all the rights and obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.622" offset="3441873">Yes you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.212" offset="3444172">You are completely correct and I believe so far as Bernhard-Altmann is concerned, I would refer the Court to the Cameron Iron case where then Fifth Circuit where certiorari is denied, where the Court pointed out distinctions between unfair labor practices and the enforcement of contracts, that one does not impinge on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.677" offset="3554095">If there is, we have any unfair labor practices, the Labor Board still sits -- still sits.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.040" offset="3579486">There is nothing in a 301 proceeding which in any respect (Inaudible) or divest the Labor Board jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.608" offset="3605817">For long time, the Labor Board has dealt it within his own policy to permit arbitrations, and whether or not, the Labor Board will take jurisdiction where there's an arbitration award is a matter of its own discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.639" offset="3657958">It makes up his mind whether or not this arbitration award carries out its policies, or whether or not he believes it took -- it should take a jurisdiction, but the point I make is, that in the 301 action unfair labor practices are not involved but other considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.439" offset="3745102">I might point out that in any event of course, it's more than 6 months of taking place and so, there could not be any unfair labor practices brought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.421" offset="3785017">I would like to close my main statement with the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.286" offset="3828485">Respondent in his main brief seeks (Inaudible) to support the court's holding, that exclusive bargaining recognition is a condition precedent to the court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.666" offset="3902046">Indeed, he poses the question in that light, but when confronted with the members-only argument, but the members only argument if -- if -- if -- if members-only contracts had been forced, cannot be squared in the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.328" offset="3980727">He then retreats and accuses -- and accuses us of misreading the Court's opinion and thereby concedes that members-only contracts are enforceable if they can be found to the collective bargaining contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.900" offset="4055019">I point this out because it -- to me, it appears to be abandonment by counsel of the Court's basic rationale because aside from the rationale, that 301 must be related to other sections of the law requiring exclusive bargaining right for other purposes, the holding that this is not a collective bargaining agreement makes no sense at all because there's no examination of that proposition because plainly any agreement between a labor union and an employer execute on behalf of one or more -- of several employees is within in a broad sense, a collective bargaining agreement is not a -- a terminal part, there is nothing to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.939" offset="4239130">And so, if the court's opinion, lower court's opinion is be given any rationale at all, even though I think a highly disputable one, it must rest on the proposition as I think it spelled out and as it pointed out in its findings of fact that union involved was not the exclusive bargaining agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.424" offset="4317080">I therefore conclude by pointing out that I believe that the courts -- the lower court erred very seriously because I think if allowed to stand, it will create a very serious frustration and impediment to the carrying out of the promise of Lincoln Mills and the Steelworkers cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1142.265" offset="4672449">In this particular situation, this did not come to counsel's intention -- attention until we are practically finished with our brief, and it came to our attention only through receipt of reports filed with the Labor Department by respective labor unions under the Labor Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.243" offset="4744338">Those reports revealed that three labor unions, as they said in their -- as of January 1, 1960, this local merged with Local 128 and 954 and just to count from number 6 to 4 they knew Local 954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.653" offset="4833991">The only thing I can say to you about this local -- this new local, this new union I gather from the contents of those reports that I have filed with the government agency is that, this was not a mere change in identity as some of the old cases of where they changed affiliations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.584" offset="4917687">The report indicates that after the merge and after the formation of the new union, the members of locals 128 and 633 who are the petitioners here comprised about, if not a little less, but let's say about one-forth of the total membership of the new union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.019" offset="5007444">The officers of the new union were not in fact the same officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.007" offset="5031372">There are only two officers of the -- of the combined 633 and 128 petitioners who became minor officers in the new union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.451" offset="5093125">I thought that it was incumbent upon me to suggest mootness because of this change in circumstances because if per chance this Court should find that the employers here were parties to a collective bargaining agreement for the purpose of the 301 suit then of course you have to take the other side of the coin and say, “Well, this new union be responsible for all the obligations that 133 -- and 128 and 633 might have had during the course of their existence, including damage actions and things of that nature.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.961" offset="5255189">So I found learning that there was a material difference in the make up and the membership of these unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.299" offset="5300537">I thought it was proper and incumbent upon me to bring that to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.092" offset="5319764">And one other thing in connection with that, I should bring to the Court's attention that is in connection with Mr. Lippman's statement that a function within the organization with a 954 as they use to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.781" offset="5370546">Well now, we are presently and I think I have pointed out in my brief in Lasalle's, one of the respondents here, presently has pending before the NLRB, a petition for election by local 954, not the Lasalle's division of 954 or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.369" offset="5452884">If that were true, then the -- these divisions within the union, I would think under this -- this Court's holding would be labor organizations and they too would have to comply with the Reporting Act and so far as were able to determine, there has been no such reports made by labor organizations or so called divisions, department store divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.904" offset="5563016">The reason of Mr. Lippman's presentation to this point, I feel it's incumbent to not only rearrange, but add to with the facts that he gave, in order that the Court might get a better backdrop against which this very important question can be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.947" offset="5667192">These -- these two unions and for convenience, I'm just going to call it this union, had for many years as he said, bargained with an organization of multi -- multi-employer organiza -- organization known as Retail Associates Inc., who -- who was the bargaining agent for four downtown Toledo department stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.426" offset="5761128">They were never -- they were just recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.454" offset="5773145">They were never certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.700" offset="5778160">There has never been in an election among the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.762" offset="5786415">In 1957 at the conclusion or an impasse was receipt -- was reached in the -- in collective bargaining and the union called a strike against retail associates and part of their strategy was to start (Inaudible) picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.869" offset="5858826">They picket only on of the four stores, as I say all over in the downtown area of Toledo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.900" offset="5882964">They picket Tikis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.796" offset="5890591">Tikis immediately within a day withdrew formerly from Retail Associates and entered into direct negotiations with the union and entered into a contract with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.444" offset="5961122">Three days after that, on November 20, 1957, the strike started on the November 15, three days after Tikis had capitulated, the stores, Retail Associates, filed a petition with the NLRB, asking that the NLRB conduct an election among the employees of the three stores, on a single unit to determine whether or not this union did in fact represent a majority of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.619" offset="6093824">In 19 -- April of 1958, that's five month later, the NLRB finally ordered an election in a single -- on a single unit basis of three stores whereupon the unions filed an action in the District Court here in Washington and was successful in getting an injunction restraining the NLRB from conducting an investigation or an election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.021" offset="6283473">After the Retail Associates filed the request for an election on November 20th, three days thereafter, there's no strike -- there's no strike activity in the meantime, on November 23, the unions notified each one of the store that they no longer wanted to bargain on the basis of multi-employer bargaining, but wanted to bargain in fact with each store separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.596" offset="6401755">So that when -- in April, when the NLRB ordered the election on a single unit of the three stores, the basis of the injunction action was that the employees were being deprived of their rights in being forced in the multi-employer bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.135" offset="6475943">In fact, they said it this way that employers were permitted to withdraw for multi-employer bargaining, Tikis, the union should have the same right, if they no longer wanted to engage in multi-employer party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.846" offset="6534771">And therefore, they were -- the employees were being deprived of their rights to bargain with the rights to have them on the act to bargain separately and they wanted to bargain on a single store basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.887" offset="6586911">Well, the local court – the District Court here in Washington granted a temporary injunction and no appeal was taken because immediately thereafter, the three separate stores or the three stores separately in effect disbanded Retail Associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.126" offset="6671862">And the three stores each filed a petition asking that the NLRB conduct an election among the employees of the respective stores and a unit among the stores only like the union had wanted -- said they wanted to bargain for.</text>
