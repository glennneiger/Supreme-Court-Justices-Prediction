            <label>Mr. Gilbert A. Cornfield</label>
            <text syncTime="46.145" offset="287953">Please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.559" offset="297566">This case comes before this Court on the original pleadings fi -- filed by the employer in the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.155" offset="352005">In that light, we must take the pleadings as well pleaded at this juncture in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.662" offset="390040">The original complaint filed by the employer was in three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.976" offset="419297">First was a suit by the employer against an international union and its local affiliate for breach of a no-strike clause of their bargaining agreement requesting damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.453" offset="481155">The second count was against 12 local union committeemen for instigating and participating in the alleged breach of the no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.493" offset="541341">I might say that the allegations of fact against the international and local union in Count I were the same as the allegations against of the 12 local union committeemen in Count II.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.936" offset="615111">Count III of the complaint was against all the defendants, the international, the local affiliate and the 12 local union committeemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.002" offset="663385">And it was a request for a blanket injunction operating into the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.809" offset="694627">This point I wish to comment that the time the suit was brought there was no alleged breach of a no-strike clause then occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.353" offset="752828">I wish to state the request for the injunction contained in Count III as against the organizations and the individual defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.256" offset="812387">Each of them, their agents, servants, counselors and all to whom notice hereof may come be enjoined and restraint from aiding, abetting, fomenting, advising, participating in, ratifying or condoning any strike, stoppage of work, slowdown or any other disruption of or interference with normal employment or normal operation or production by any employee within the bargaining unit at the employer's East Chicago, Indiana refinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.682" offset="982079">I might add that the broad scope of the requested injunction presumably would include new employees which may be hired at the plant in the indefinite future.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.352" offset="1032756">I presume that the employer would hand each new employee a copy of the injunction order along with his employment application.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.882" offset="1078941">The -- we filed a motion to dismiss these three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.667" offset="1106004">The District Court, after reconsideration, dismissed Count II, that is the action against the individual defendants and their individual capacities and the requested injunction leaving Count I.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gilbert A. Cornfield</label>
            <text syncTime="272.895" offset="1194924">Before the recess, I had indicated that the District Court had dismissed Count II of the complaint that is the action against the individual local officials and Count III of the complaint, request for the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.695" offset="1262111">Case at that point went before the Court of Appeals with the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.925" offset="1283114">The Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision as regards to Count III and the injunction request and overruled the District Court in its decision to dismiss Count II.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.045" offset="1343509">I might say that the Seventh Circuit's opinion as to the action against the individuals indicates that it is the Seventh Circuit's view that the individuals might be held responsible for breach of a no-strike clause if the unions were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.327" offset="1448730">Now, in looking over the employer's complaint, Sinclair's claim for relief sounds deceptively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.614" offset="1493870">And I believe too many years eminently fair but we submit that if individuals, local union officials are to be brought into state courts or into federal courts under diversity of citizenship jurisdiction and if the injunction requested here to operate into the indefinite future is granted, a Pandora's Box of confusing litigation will ensue before federal and state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.781" offset="1630542">We have argued rather extensively we believe in our briefs that the net result of the suit against the individuals and the request for an injunction is continuing conflict with the National Labor Relations Board and the jurisdiction of the federal courts to enforce and develop substantive law under their powers granted by Congress under Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.005" offset="1763349">Furthermore, the requested injunction not only guarantees the recurrence of such conflicts into the unforeseeable future but flies in the face of the clear language and the spirit of long standing --</text>

            <text syncTime="506.541" offset="2129586">Now, I would like in this oral presentation to discuss the implications of the requested relief by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.183" offset="2180054">First, I would to discuss Count II of the complaint, that is the request for damages against the individual local union officials under a tort, common law tort theory based on joint and several liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.014" offset="2263437">First, the employer contends that we entered into a collective bargaining contract between the unions, that is the international and its local affiliate, that this contract contains a no-strike pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.887" offset="2346924">The employer maintains that we submitted to an arbitration procedure and in return we extracted from the unions a no-strike obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.111" offset="2395826">Now, I might say that the employer does not mention also that the unions, in turn, extracted a no lockout obligation on the part of the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.518" offset="2449429">If there's a quid pro quo or anything here, it is the no-strike and the quid pro quo for the no-strike is the no lockout obligation on the part of the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="721.159" offset="2987969">But we also say further as in Drake Bakeries that the employer should initiate arbitration against the unions as to the question of the breach of the no-strike clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="737.532" offset="3053484">I would like, if possible, to reserve the question of arbitration to the last since it's been argued rather extensively in Drake Bakeries and we have -- we feel too rather important issues in addition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.162" offset="3108028">Going on from the contract, the employer says, "I negotiated a no-strike clause with the international and local affiliate."</text>
            <text syncTime="760.727" offset="3146271">Now, the employer argues that during this contract term, a work stoppage occurs and it's participated in by over half of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.082" offset="3179708">The employer alleges this complaint that 999 employees out of the 1700 employees at the refinery participated in this work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.448" offset="3221191">Now, taking the complaint as well-pleaded, there's no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.768" offset="3238431">And the employer claims that clearly a work stoppage occurs and we are entitled to fair relief for our loss of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.726" offset="3278242">And the employer reasons very simply that clearly the courts -- the court's rule is to assure just compensation for this loss of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.602" offset="3325785">Now, the employer goes on, "The unions with whom we've bargained," that is the international and local affiliate, "clearly should be held responsible for this loss of production."</text>
            <text syncTime="817.723" offset="3374268">So they filed Count I of the action, a suit under Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act against the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.328" offset="3412720">But the employer goes on further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.398" offset="3428916">And it hedges against future possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.881" offset="3442918">The employer says, "But what if we can't prove liability against the unions?</text>
            <text syncTime="840.670" offset="3466010">A work stoppage occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.628" offset="3473847">Clearly we must be able to collect from somebody."</text>
            <text syncTime="845.420" offset="3485027">Now, here's an international organization, its local affiliate, "We filed a suit against them, whether we argue the case in the court or we argue it before an arbitrator," all of the arguments in Drake Bakeries, "What if we don't win?</text>
            <text syncTime="861.311" offset="3548662">What if we can't prove that the international or -- and/or the local weren't responsible?</text>
            <text syncTime="869.014" offset="3579382">A work stoppage occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.916" offset="3587009">We must be able to collect from somebody."</text>
            <text syncTime="872.754" offset="3594428">This leads the employer to a seemingly logical conclusion that the employees themselves should be held personally responsible for the stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.021" offset="3643434">Now, the employer did not choose to sue the 999 employees because this would apparently seem absurd on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.975" offset="3683244">The employer chooses to do and say, "Well, we're only going to sue the employees who led this work stoppage."</text>
            <text syncTime="902.340" offset="3712711">Now, I might say these are the same employees who are alleged the agents of the international and local union in Count I of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.048" offset="3747610">Now, the employer reasons, "We can't bring this kind of suit under Section 301 because clearly the employees themselves, the local union officials aren't labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.167" offset="3800064">So, what are we going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="926.849" offset="3810722">But it has to come in the state court someway.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.603" offset="3821798">There must be a common law cause of action."</text>
            <text syncTime="932.054" offset="3831620">This leads the employer to America's feelings of anxiety with the old English common law tort established in Lumley versus Gye.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.118" offset="3879894">These individual, union officials stand to the membership as third parties who conspired to interfere with the contractual relationship of these 999 employees and therefore they are guilty of a common law tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.791" offset="3954500">It comes into the federal court solely by virtue of diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.620" offset="3977801">Sinclair is a foreign corporation as in terms of Indiana and all the individual members are either citizens of Indiana, some are citizens of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.352" offset="4028792">Now, the employer basis his argument on the fact that if a stoppage occurs, there must be some type of legal theory which allows us to collect and the employer then makes out a seemingly simple case for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.481" offset="4101308">We submit that this simple case of relief opens up direct issues which are in conflict with the principles of federal preemption established in Garmon and reinforced very recently by this Court relative to collective bargaining agreements in Dowd Box and in Lucas Flower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.483" offset="4189288">Lucas Flower and Dowd Box, taken together along with Lincoln Mills, establish the principle that it's true that state courts have jurisdiction over suits for breaches of collective bargaining agreements but the law that is to be applied must be substan -- substantive federal law developed under Section 301 as per set forth in the Lincoln Mills decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.837" offset="4294719">Now, we submit whatever chain of reasoning the employer chooses to follow establishing some basis of liability against these individuals, ultimately, you're brought back to the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.786" offset="4358562">And being brought back to the collective bargaining agreement there exist only one cause of action and that is against the labor organizations themselves under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.386" offset="4404955">Under the Lucas Flower decision, a state court cannot entertain an action for breach of collective bargaining contracts that is in conflict with the jurisdiction of the federal courts under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.267" offset="4464410">Now, I would like to demonstrate that whatever logical position the employer assumes, you are brought back to the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.239" offset="4524283">The employer alleges that the individuals, the individual local union officials conspired, instigated, participated in breaches of the collective bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.949" offset="4583215">This was the original complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.150" offset="4591992">The employer felt, we believe, that this was so blatantly under the jurisdiction of Section 301 that the employer changed his theory and said, "No, its not that they conspired to breach the collective bargaining agreement but the collective bargaining agreement establishes 999 personal contracts containing no-strike pledge by every individual running to the employer."</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.221" offset="4688227">And it is these, these contracts that these individuals conspired to breach or instigated people to breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.276" offset="4724485">Now, if the unions under Count I, whether it's in a District Court or before an arbitrator, are held not to have breached the no-strike clause, how can any court find that the individuals have breached the no-strike clause without running into clear conflict with federal substantive law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.703" offset="4822183">Either the no-strike clause has been breached or it hasn't been breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.604" offset="4837752">And if it has been breach, it's a collective bargaining issue and it's a suit under the collective bargaining contract that must come within the purview of Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.165" offset="4884041">But the employer may still assert that there's some basic equity involved that a work stoppage occurs and we want to be assured compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.962" offset="4923225">The employer argues that we know we can penalize the individuals that caused or participated in the breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.256" offset="4956348">We know we can threaten them with this charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.897" offset="4967006">We know we can suspend them or discipline them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.493" offset="4981321">But that's not enough, we want to get money in -- under a joint and several obligation theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.207" offset="5008175">Now, the employer says, "You see, if we go into Count I and only on Count I, the unions may argue that they aren't guarantors against every work stoppage, that we would have to show that they actually, the international and/or the local, instigated the work stoppage, the wildcat."</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.215" offset="5088214">Now, if we can't show that, the work stoppage still occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.784" offset="5106500">I might say this, if the union is not a guarantor, it's a matter of contract interpretation whether they are guarantors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.323" offset="5136697">And if the union is not a guarantor and the unions are held not to have been responsible for the work stoppage that means that there's been no violation of a no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.614" offset="5177866">It's clear it seems to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.651" offset="5186017">If the unions are guarantors, then the allegations of Count II are moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.319" offset="5208691">There's no need for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.887" offset="5214960">The work stoppage occurs, there's been a breach of contract, the unions are responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.553" offset="5237635">If the unions are responsible, only if they instigated the walk out, the wildcat, this is a matter of contract interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.038" offset="5295522">Now, let us say that the Court would still maintain and there's some theory, it's not Lumley versus Gye, some equitable concept that the employer is still entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.764" offset="5354454">We can't conceive how but let us say this occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.423" offset="5365112">What are the consequences of this type of decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.970" offset="5383293">Our individual union officials then to be forced to defend actions in state courts, the employer indicates that he should be allowed to bring suits against individuals whether or not he has the right to bring suits against the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.719" offset="5450271">So, let us say he didn't bring the suit against the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.117" offset="5463855">He just went in to just -- the state -- the Indiana state courts under this tort theory and sue the individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.979" offset="5491336">Does this mean that the individuals have to defend on the basis, "No, I was not acting alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.618" offset="5513801">I was acting as an agent of the union"?</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.541" offset="5525504">You would then be forced to the position that individual, local union officials could only defend themselves adequately in a state court by forcing their unions to be the true party's defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.416" offset="5589034">Would this mean then that the unions would have to take disciplinary action or expel these men because they unduly charged their unions with the violation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.958" offset="5627173">It's like a corporate official being sued personally and say, "No, you don't want me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.145" offset="5651937">I was only acting as agent for my corporation."</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.255" offset="5664371">This would be the type of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.566" offset="5669595">You're forcing this type of local union officials to submit to if they have to defend tort actions in state courts or under the diversity of citizenship jurisdiction in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.647" offset="5733961">Even if a local union official would take the position in a state court that it was the union's responsibility, the state court would have to interpret was it the union's responsibly and again, we're brought back to the collective bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.133" offset="5799894">What is the no-strike clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.962" offset="5807208">What did the unions agree to?</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.178" offset="5820061">It's inescapable it seems to us that the issue is a collective bargaining dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.836" offset="5842735">And under Lucas and Dowd Box, there is nothing left, if there ever was, any tort theory to be left with the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.013" offset="5887457">As a final answer to the question of individual liability, if the employer truly believes his remedies are inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.883" offset="5934895">It is not for the courts to mold a new bargaining agreement to meet Sinclair Refining Company's needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.219" offset="5976273">The employer must return to the bargaining table if the employer feels that the no-strike commitment was inadequate, either the employer believes the no-strike commitment is adequate or the employer does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.570" offset="6037608">Only the employers' willingness to bargain and the unions' willingness to negotiate will resolve this issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.326" offset="8628642">As I was saying, I don't -- do not -- I think that the Norris-LaGuardia and Clayton Act clearly applies to the requested injunction relief in Count III.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.938" offset="8671169">But in this part of the oral presentation, we believe that it is important to stress the considerations involved in deciding whether federal courts should be allowed to embark upon this species of injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.980" offset="8727280">I wish to remind the Court that there was no work stoppage at anytime during the -- during the course of this lawsuit unlike in Yellow Transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.881" offset="8766882">This injunction is only towards future activities which have not occurred and may never occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.395" offset="8804916">Now, the employer argues regarding Norris-LaGuardia, the Norris-LaGuardia was never intended to cover unlawful labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.300" offset="8844622">That's not a question of whether Section 301 has impliedly repeal Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.648" offset="8865938">But in Norris-LaGuardia, it never meant to cover this area, and that Norris-LaGuardia was concerned only with so-called "lawful disputes".</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.990" offset="8903346">Now, we concede in -- and this -- the number of cases on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.697" offset="8922154">The Norris-LaGuardia wasn't meant to interfere with injunctions where violence has occurred or criminal violations have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.847" offset="8962800">But this area of legality is another question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.292" offset="8976488">Now, we submit that the employer misconceives the purposes in Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.218" offset="8996237">The Clayton Act was passed in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.218" offset="9008253">Clayton Act as applied to labor organizations or labor disputes stated that injunctions couldn't be issued in disputes between employers and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.636" offset="9049945">Now, it's a matter of history that by and large, the Clayton Act was interpreted by the Court as to be applied only to legal labor activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.740" offset="9098324">And by and large, the courts before 1932 had interpreted the Clayton Act in such a way that said injunctions are only prohibited on those activities, labor activities that were lawful before Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.931" offset="9155062">Now, the Norris-LaGuardia Act was passed basically to cure this defect in the Clayton Act that has been interpreted by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.781" offset="9198529">The classic work on the subject, the labor injunction by Frankfurter and Greene, the entire thesis of the book is that the need for the Norris-LaGuardia Act is because the courts had been deciding that the Clayton Act applied only to illegal disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.955" offset="9279195">And the entire thesis of the book was that there was a need to stop injunctions from occurring by the courts in situations where the courts would issue preemptory restraining order solely on employer affidavits without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.242" offset="9356309">And then several months later, there'd be an argument of the merits but by now, the labor dispute had already been broken and whether or not the unions had a valid claim, had already been vitiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.163" offset="9408031">I wish to give an example of the effect of Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.861" offset="9426840">Let's take secondary boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.321" offset="9440632">Before Clayton Act and after Clayton Act, the courts by and large held that for unions to participate in any form of secondary boycott was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.106" offset="9475845">Now, Norris-LaGuardia did not make secondary boycotts legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.013" offset="9491414">But after Norris-LaGuardia, the courts could no longer issue injunctions to restrain secondary boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.959" offset="9527254">This would allow, presumably, employers to sue -- sue the unions or individuals for participating in breaches of secondary boycotts where there was no labor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.699" offset="9574170">It wasn't until 1935 with the passage of the Wagner Act that secondary boycotts or at least a variety of them so-called were legalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.029" offset="9615444">And here, you have a joining of the anti-injunction provisions and the -- the legalization of secondary boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.144" offset="9643969">Now, in 1947, Congress held that secondary boycotts, at least a good number of them, were unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.485" offset="9677302">But Congress did not then simply say, "Well, from now on, Norris-LaGuardia doesn't apply and from now on, you can sue."</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.977" offset="9711261">By then there have been established the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.385" offset="9724949">Congress allowed for restraining orders but had to be done through the procedures of the National Labor Relations Board and the National Labor Relations Board has to be the initiating party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.366" offset="9768835">So that the argument, the Norris La Guardia, applies only to so-called "legal disputes" is clearly incorrect in terms of the history before and after Norris-LaGuardia and the reasons for passing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.512" offset="9817422">Now, even if we are satisfied that a wildcat that is, as Mr. Meyer in the Drake Bakeries argument adequately showed, not a strike for economic purposes, any kind of work stoppage that takes place during the course of the collective bargaining contract developing out of the spontaneous friction and interaction of employees and supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.813" offset="9934660">Even if we say it is socially undesirable, I do not submit that the answer lies in allowing the courts to issue wholesale injunctions or allowing the courts to exercise injunctions preliminary restraining orders, preempting restraining orders on a basis of affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.581" offset="10021700">What -- even if we said, and as a matter of social policy, that some type of restraint should be put on this type of work stoppages, what are the possibilities?</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.336" offset="10088678">Our restraining orders and contempt citations to run against individual union officials as well as members of the organization and the organization themselves, the type of injunction requested here would run against organizations, would run against union officials, would also run against members and any new employees that come in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.275" offset="10184495">Do we really mean that granting the injunction request here would allow contempt citations to issue preemptory against all these people?</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.081" offset="10223679">But what if we say be such an injunction should issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.144" offset="10251995">Does this mean that a work stoppage occurs three, four, five years from now?</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.835" offset="10274670">The employer comes running in to court with a contempt citation for this injunction, the employer has requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.189" offset="10300165">The people are out on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.031" offset="10307480">This means that if they refuse to return to work, they are then in contempt of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.584" offset="10325661">This would be solely clearly -- so clearly violative of Thirteenth Amendment, I don't think we have to discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.354" offset="10348753">It would be specific performance of personal service commitments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.177" offset="10368084">But what does it mean to say you're having an injunction running against individuals?</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.992" offset="10395355">Then we ask ourselves, "Well, we won't issue injunction against individuals only be against the organizations."</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.874" offset="10422836">What is it mean to say that the in -- organizations are enjoin from encouraging strikes?</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.757" offset="10458363">These are wildcats remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.560" offset="10465573">In Yellow Transit, there was no question that the company called the work stoppages a dispute whether they have the right to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.590" offset="10493680">Here, it's a wildcat situation that happened and has stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.139" offset="10515937">By its very nature, the union maintains we didn't call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.157" offset="10535999">This is the nature of wildcats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.188" offset="10544149">Now, if you issue the injunction, if the courts were allowed to issue the injunction against the organizations against encouraging the wildcats, does this mean that a labor organization could be held in contempt of court if six employees temporarily refused to work because of a job assignment dispute?</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.534" offset="10625546">73 three employees refused to work for one hour because of same type of dispute, 24 employees for the same reasons for an hour and a three quarters and 24 employees again for two hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.684" offset="10670059">But these are the allegations of work stoppages that are contained in a plaintiff's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.079" offset="10703705">This would mean that the complaint -- the plant -- the employer would be allowed to run into the local federal court that issues the injunction and get contempt citation against the organizations for everyone of these occurrences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.737" offset="10754278">And what about these type of disputes?</text>

            <text syncTime="4147.942" offset="16695150">And the actual grievances that were filed are attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.255" offset="16716361">No arbitration has yet taken placed and I doubt whether one ever will.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.608" offset="16737782">No umpire has been na -- named, no steps have been taken to prosecute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.173" offset="16764113">But there'd been no arbitration here and an arbitration board hasn't even been set up and that affidavit is vigorously contested by the affidavit of Mr. Robert D. Clark which is as factual as we could make it attaching the actual grievance forms that were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.631" offset="16857945">Now, the two issues that are presented here is of course one by ours at the dismissal of the injunction count.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.498" offset="16901413">The count obviously was based upon and is still based upon a filling of a proclivity for illegal conduct in this particular bargaining unit, nine illegal stoppages in 19 months demonstrates the necessity for something.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.242" offset="17000364">When the case was filed, Judge Swygert originally overruled the motion to dismiss the injunction count.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.030" offset="17035473">Then this Court decided the North Western Railroad Telegraphers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.995" offset="17059401">There was a motion for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.532" offset="17073507">Judge Swygert believed that North -- the North Western Telegraphers case stood for a blanket pronouncement that under no circumstances in anything remotely smelling of a labor dispute could there be an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.919" offset="17131081">We think he was mistaken for the reasons that we have set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.800" offset="17158562">And that this case is the counterpart in the industrial field of the Chicago River and Indiana case in the railroad field that you're governed by the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.385" offset="17216867">Now, in railway labor, you have the so-called "major disputes" that the parties are free following process of mediation to do what they please and go on out on strike if they can't agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.213" offset="17272247">And you have the so-called "minor disputes" concerning terms, applications, contracts of employment that they are at liberty to take to the Railroad Adjustment Board and have determined precisely the situation that is provided here in the industrial field by a contract providing for binding arbitration and that's precisely what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.808" offset="17370572">These were all that disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.346" offset="17376737">The complaint so alleges and the motion to dismiss so agrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.931" offset="17407143">If Norris-LaGuardia does not stand in the way of enjoining strike and illegal action for minor disputes under Railway Labor, a fortiori it should not be held to do so on -- in the industrial field under Labor Management Relations Act because the 1947 Amendments spoke so strongly, not merely in Section 301 but in 203 in the various other places, are the desirability of having contracts that are substantially like this one, with a no-strike clause or no-lockout clause with grievance procedure ending in compulsory arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="4387.967" offset="17655202">And I am thinking always in the terminology that the fellow who brings the grievance is the employer or his agent because the management has the right to make the working decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.845" offset="17702745">It makes at its peril as to whether it's right or wrong but it has made its decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="4408.426" offset="17737122">But whatever it maybe, the -- the position of the parties in this grievance matters is -- is not the same because the employer can fire a man if he thinks he's been bad enough or suspend him or whatever he does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.490" offset="17801383">And when I use compulsory arbitration, it was in the sense that the grievant could compel the employer to submit to and accept the results of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.306" offset="17856554">Now, we make an argument in here that I'm not going to burden the Court for trying to recite the cases because I probably couldn't and I think you will want to read them more closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.095" offset="17915800">Prior to the adoption of Norris-LaGuardia, there weren't too many cases because contracts of this nature of course we're not so general in as they are now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.360" offset="17964805">But so far as we have been able to discover, there was never any question that in no lockout, no-strike contract could be enforced by injunctive relief either against strike or against lockout.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.134" offset="18031888">And the courts held such contracts were commendable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.934" offset="18051114">We had one in Illinois, (Inaudible) Workers which we cite in our brief and it had a compulsory arbitration provision in it and a no-strike, no-lockout clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.263" offset="18100433">That case was decided in 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.606" offset="18109837">There were a series of cases in New York in the 1920s.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.476" offset="18129272">There was never any question during the very heated Norris-LaGuardia debates over the wisdom, the social soundness and the legality of those decisions in that limited field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.557" offset="18185592">That's all I'm talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.214" offset="18204191">Now, it's perfectly true that a great deal of ingenuity from some very agile minds went into drafting the definition of labor dispute that is contained in the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.661" offset="18254033">And I would be the last man in the world to say that you can't take that sweeping definition of back-end of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.253" offset="18284335">And dialectally, you can read it to cover nearly anything you can think.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.794" offset="18302516">But this Court through the Virginia Railway case, through the Chicago River, Indiana, through Lincoln Mills as gradually been holding that the definitions of Norris-LaGuardia are to be read in the light and against the evils it was aimed to -- to cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.978" offset="18399274">Roughly, they were the stifling of organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.705" offset="18418186">Now, no labor union has ever had a right, constitutional right, common law right, any kind of a right to violate a contract that it is freely entered into as a result of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.761" offset="18482448">It's grossly illegal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.810" offset="18490598">It does the country great harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.463" offset="18509197">Norris-LaGuardia by none of its proponents was ever intended to legalize that type of conduct nor to takeaway a beneficent remedy that would stop it because you may have all the talk you want, all we can sue this union, we can do this or that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.937" offset="18607104">No court in the land including this high can restore lost production.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.346" offset="18632808">No amount of damages you could give this employer for an illegal strike would compensate the innocent employers who were involved in nearly every illegal strike that takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.061" offset="18703653">And there is nothing heinous or unfair or socially undesirable about stopping an illegal course of conduct before it goes too far and brings about that irreparable damage that no one including this High Court can ever cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.539" offset="18801560">There is no real answer to our injunction prayer here except for counsel to assert, "Oh, what a horrible thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.198" offset="18840116">There'll be contempt, perpetual injunction running on, we didn't ask for that."</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.832" offset="18862686">We ask only one single thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.521" offset="18877419">We used enough words so we hoped we didn't leave any loose ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.010" offset="18899362">But we asked only one thing, an injunction against any further strikes or stoppages over matters which could and if valid might be submitted to arbitration under this contract grievances falling within this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.953" offset="18979192">It couldn't go out on strike over that either under this contract or any renewal or extension of it, that had be identical or substantially the similar language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.043" offset="19027571">Now, to the extent that we asked for one beyond the then life of the then contract, we were reaching into the future in accordance with what I think are generally recognized the facts that these contracts generally and this one in particular provide for renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.217" offset="19104266">And they usually are renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.613" offset="19109804">The basic framework of many of these contracts stays the same year after year after year for grammar ambiguous clauses and everything else because anyone who's anything experience with collective bargaining knows that changing some simple little thing in there is the hardest thing in the world to do and it's about as broad as it is long.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.024" offset="19195486">This injunction was not a sweeping.</text>

            <text syncTime="4973.250" offset="19996400">But 800 men walked out of that plant in Chicago, Friday and they haven't been back yet.</text>
