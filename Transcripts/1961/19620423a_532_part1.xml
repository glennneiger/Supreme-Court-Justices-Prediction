            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="15.970" offset="167267">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.624" offset="185866">These are two cases hereon certiorari to the Court of Appeals to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.127" offset="211884">The question presented is whether injuries sustained by shipyard employees while working on vessels under construction but which have been launched and are float on navigable waters are compensable under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.620" offset="289834">The facts on which this question arises differ in immaterial respect for case to case but they are substantially identical, indeed identical in all material respect and the Travelers Insurance case, the first case, will serve to illustrate both.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.544" offset="365589">The insured -- the Levingston Shipbuilding Company operated the shipyard on the Sabine River which flows between Texas and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.757" offset="406444">It's engaged both in new constructions of new vessels and in the repair of vessels which are previously been put into service.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.941" offset="447091">Unquestionably, many of its employees are engaged in maritime employment and therefore undeniably, Levingston was an employer covered by the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.644" offset="501948">McGuyer, the employee who was killed was employed by Levingston as a welder to work indiscriminately at repairing vessels which had been in service or taken out of service for repairs and also at completing vessels which were under construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.739" offset="582301">On the day in question, he was working on the superstructure of a building rig, a vessel which had been launched and was floating in the navigable waters of the Sabine River but it had not been completed and therefore had not been put into service.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.057" offset="651577">There was an explosion and the cause of which is immaterial, McGuyer suffered very severe injuries of which a week later caused his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.841" offset="698702">In seeking compensation for these injuries sustained in the course of his employment, McGuyer's family had to choose between seeking compensation under the federal statute or under the Texas Act which has agreed would've been the applicable state statute even though the injury happened to occur over on the Louisiana side of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.292" offset="796505">Under the Texas Act, the widow would receive $35 a week for 360 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.224" offset="824299">That would be the maximum, or a total of $12,600.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.673" offset="846033">Under the federal statute, the widow would receive in her own right something over $28 a week during her widowhood and an additional $12.15 a week for each of two children on account of their minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.530" offset="909458">This would make a total maximum compensation to Mrs. McGuyer and the children of $83,500 or approximately six and half times to some payable under the Texas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.357" offset="972779">Mrs. McGuyer in fact filed claims under both the Texas and federal statutes but the Texas claim was expressly made subject to the claims under the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.575" offset="1021680">The Deputy Commissioner, conducting a hearing on the claim under the Federal Act at first found that this was not a covered injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.324" offset="1068701">The case was then carried by the widow to the District Court and while it was pending there, the Deputy Commissioner asked to have it remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.396" offset="1104959">It was remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.052" offset="1111542">The Deputy Commissioner then made a new finding and then awarded compensation to the widow and minor children.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.017" offset="1151457">That award was taken to the District Court by the Insurance Company, the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.900" offset="1174967">The District Court ruled that they're -- McGuyer had been engaged in covered employment and that therefore the injury was compensable under the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.242" offset="1220315">The gist of its opinion is at page 40 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.192" offset="1240168">The Court said in a short opinion, “Here, McGuyer's death arose out of it in the course of his employment and since Levingston had other employees engaged in maritime employment and since McGuyer's death admittedly occurred upon navigable waters of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="302.176" offset="1312057">His widow and children are entitled to compensation under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.303" offset="1328567">So you're not -- the District Court made the right to compensation turn on three facts which we think are decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.829" offset="1362735">First, that the Levingston Shipbuilding Company, the employer, admittedly had the employees engaged in maritime employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.605" offset="1401814">Second, that the injury occurred in the course of McGuyer's work and as a result of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.630" offset="1437863">And third, that it occurred upon navigable water and we think were those three facts here the Federal Act applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.207" offset="1984240">And we think those are the decisive circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.281" offset="2004511">In the Avondale Shipyards' case, the second case, the employee, Minus Aizen was also employed to work indiscriminately upon both vessels being repaired in the Avondale Shipyard and upon vessels under construction and he, like McGuyer, was working upon a drilling rig, a vessel which had been launched and was floating on navigable waters at the time of the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.758" offset="2126451">Aizen was injured while also working.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.952" offset="2143169">In his case, he was not killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.895" offset="2158947">He was totally and permanently disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.484" offset="2173262">And again, we have a marked difference between the compensation that he would receive if he were -- permitted to the state law and the compensation which he may recover under the Federal Act may recover in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.973" offset="2231254">In human terms, the difference is this, under the Louisiana Act, he would receive $25 for 400 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.473" offset="2273259">This would cover him until he was 35 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.156" offset="2287992">From the time he was 35 until his death, he would have no means of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.826" offset="2314637">Under the Federal Act, the payments would run, he being totally and permanently disabled for as long as he lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.069" offset="2347656">In actuarial terms, the payments might come to 10 times as much under the federal statute as under the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.251" offset="2384332">In his case, the Deputy Commissioner's initial award, awarded compensation under the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.349" offset="2416724">The company took the case to the District Court, a different District Court, I may say than the Levingston Shipbuilding case went to and that district judge also sustained the award that's upholding the coverage of the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.657" offset="2489971">The cases were argued on the same day in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and both were substantially decided in the opinion in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.303" offset="2536573">The Court held squarely that employees injured while working on the construction of a new vessel even though it has been launched and float in navigable water, must obtain compensation under the state law and may not obtain compensation under the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.794" offset="2622568">The opinion, I think, really stands on two legs.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.394" offset="2644929">First, the Court drew a very sharp distinction between the completion of a new vessel and the repair of an existing vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.828" offset="2686725">Now, of course, both types of work when the vessel is in float are within the maritime jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.645" offset="2717968">But the new construction the Court -- the Fifth -- the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said, it's within the category maritime but local so that the state law can apply and therefore it said, “The Federal Act cannot apply.”</text>
            <text syncTime="669.416" offset="2781080">The second leg of the Court's opinion was to go back to the early president in Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company against Rohde, a case decided before the enactment of the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.610" offset="2837817">And to say that since that case held that an employee engaged in new construction upon navigable waters on a floating (Inaudible), could recover under a state Longshoremen's Act, therefore, he could not recover under the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.001" offset="2907408">There are two consequences of this distinction and reasoning that I'd like to advert too very quickly, the first is that it makes the compensation, to employee like -- employees like these, turn entirely on the happenstance of whether on a particular day they are on a new home or upon an old house being repaired because they are employed like many of -- these both were employed like any -- many other workers to work indiscriminately on new construction and repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.860" offset="3054843">The second point I would simply mention briefly at this day is that the drawing of this distinction led the court below into a dictum which I think is revealing of its error because it is squarely contrary to two recent decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.081" offset="3139688">In drawing this distinction between new construction and repair, the Court flatly stated that if the men were engaged in repair work, they must sue under the state law and could not recover under the Federal Law because this is squarely inconsistent with the decisions of this Court in the more vast cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.589" offset="3233729">Both of which hold that employees engaged in repair work may recover under the state statute and I think while this is the not -- is the other half of the pair than the case we have here that it is the converse and shows the essential error in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.323" offset="3316694">Now the critical words of the statute are conveniently found on pages two and three of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.784" offset="3354520">At the top of page three, you will find the definition of employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.361" offset="3380851">The term employer means an employer any of whose employees are employed in maritime employment in whole or in part on navigable waters of the United States including any dry dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.236" offset="3436335">And this plainly encompasses both the respondents in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.520" offset="3457442">Then Section 3 (a) 903 of the Code, provides compensation should be payable under these chapter with respect of disability or death of an employee which incorporates by reference as you see the definition of employer and employee but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States including any dry dock, we admittedly meet that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.601" offset="3577814">And if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by state law of the critical question in this case stated in general terms is whether that concluding proviso or qualification, if recovery for disability or death may not be validly provided by state law, bars federal compensation here because through the tolerance or sufferance of admiralty, prior to 1927, states had been allowed to give state compensation under the conditions obtained in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.211" offset="3772165">In answering these question, there is one premise which must be borne in mind and that is whatever may have been the initial intention in this respect, it is plainly clear today that the statute does not make state and federal compensation mutually exclusive in all cases, and that, I say, whatever may I have been the initial meaning of this language, has now become a premise so well established that I think it takes no argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.298" offset="3900583">This is the statute which has evolved in role to meet real conditions and we interpret it in the light of present and not simply going back to earlier interpretation as it was a bare colloc -- bare collocation of words.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.309" offset="3976652">In our view, the concluding portion does not bar recovery under the federal statute, and as I said before, we think the federal statute applies where the three significant factors that I mentioned in the discussion with Mr. Justice Stewart are brought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.989" offset="4055333">We find support for this view in the legislative history and background of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.072" offset="4083649">We think it is plainly sustained by the decisions of this Court and indeed except for some recent decisions in the Fifth Circuit by the uniform course of decisions for 20 years in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.580" offset="4141641">And finally, we urge that even if these contentions were not enough alone to make out petition in this case, even then under the twilight zone doctrine, established by Davis against Department of Labor, the award of compensation should've been sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.776" offset="4218441">I think it would be helpful at this point before coming to those three contentions, if I were to recall for the Court, the background against which the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act were mentioned and also, I recognized, the Court has been offered a good many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.463" offset="4301197">You will recall and I can do it by referring to three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.664" offset="4321991">You will recall first that the Jensen case laid down the proposition of constitutional law that injuries occurring within the jurisdiction of the admiralty courts were not compensable under state statutes because admiralty law required uniformity and therefore the diverse rules of the 48 states might not be applied and that distinction was subsequently extended in two cases, the Knickerbocker Ice and Dawson cases to hold that Congress could not permit the states to apply their compensation statutes in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.818" offset="4510595">The second case that I would refer to is this case of Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company against Rohde, which introduced the so-called doctrine of maritime but local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.888" offset="4570885">In Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company against Rohde, an employee was injured while engaged in new construction of a ship which was afloat on the navigable water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.442" offset="4633161">He had been employed to engage only in new construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.446" offset="4657194">His employment contract contained references expressed or implied to the state compensation act and the state compensation act provided that an employee who elected to come under the Act should be deemed to have waived his rights under the substantive law of torts to sue for personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.144" offset="4755937">And the particular case which ultimately came to this Court was a suit in tort to recover for personal injuries but it was held that the employee was barred by his acceptance rights under the state law and that the state compensation act could apply because the Court said, this was maritime but local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.321" offset="4864606">Many of the commentators striated the Rohde case as they retreat in part from Jensen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.554" offset="4893550">There were a series of five or six cases in this Court that applied the doctrine and the various other kinds of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.550" offset="4937540">The third case, I need to mention only briefly, Industrial Commission against Nordenholt Corporation which drew the line between state and federal -- between -- through the permissible line of state acts in such a way between the ship and the dock so that even if the dock reached out in the navigable waters, if the injury occurred on the dock, the state law might be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.500" offset="5057390">I mentioned this case because it's one of the things to which the concluding words of Section 903 might be taken to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.985" offset="5095320">So the question here stated in the length of its background -- of the background of the Longshoremen's Act is whether this concluding if clause -- if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation, may not be validly provided by state law is to be held to incorporate into the Federal Act a limitation on the cover of which excludes from the Federal Act this pre-1927 category of maritime but local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.944" offset="5243173">Our first point is that the legislative history shows that the Congress did not have any intention -- affirmative intention to incorporate in the Section 903 the doctrine of maritime but local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.598" offset="5333765">I stated in terms but did not have any intention to incorporate it because I do think that this is a statute of which must be interpreted as I have said earlier in the length of developments since it's neck but if there were clear evidence that Congress laid stress on the maritime but local doctrine, naturally, that would give us a pause in arguing that it was not effective law today but quite contraries the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.054" offset="5447555">Well, I do not know that one could press so far as to say that the legislative history shows affirmatively that the doctrine was repudiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.315" offset="5480678">It certainly finds more in that direction than it did in any direction of preserving it or attaching importance to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.811" offset="5518608">The bill of which ultimately was enacted, originated in the Senate and it's interesting to note that the original Senate Bill did incorporate the maritime but local doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.578" offset="5581720">We've set forth the relevant excerpt on page 32 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.890" offset="5610977">This actually apply to any employment performed on a place within the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States except employment of local concern and of no direct relation to navigation and commerce which will not apply to imply if he's a master or a member of the crew of a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.241" offset="5684328">In the hearings, those critical words which are taken from the Rohde case, employment of local concern and of no direction, no direct relation to navigation and commerce were explained as coming from the Rohde case and were severely criticized, indeed in a written memorandum filed some time after the conclusion of the hearings but before the committee made its report, on behalf of the insurance companies, the association of ship builders, there was a precise criticism of this doctrine, the criticism is quoted over on page 34 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.357" offset="5864782">It finds both with the indefiniteness of the words that says that there would be enumerable questions coming before the court if they were preserved and urges that the statute be expanded so as to cover all maritime employment under the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.989" offset="6055372">The chief debate, indeed, was throughout to the hearings of the Senate and in the House and such a few references are on the floor was over the position of seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.843" offset="6106781">But I do think that some significance must be attached to this change in wording which the committee made because if you will look over on page 35, Mr. Justice Stewart, you will see that the Committee, when it reported the bill, rewrote the definition of coverage in such a way as to leave out any references to the language of the Rohde case or maritime but local and to expand its coverage even though it did not changed it to include seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.267" offset="6252440">It then -- it read at that stage, compensation should be payable under these act in respect to disability or death of an employee but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon navigable waters of the United States including any dry dock or occurring while such employee was employed onboard the vessel of the United States on the high seas and if recovery for disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings, may not validly be provided by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.559" offset="6381589">That is the law as it stands today except that there is this phrase coming right after footnote 10 or occurring while such employee was employed on board the vessel of the United States which was of course subsequently believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.714" offset="6454209">I may say that although that suggest Justice Stewart, that seamen might have been covered at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.868" offset="6482840">If you turn over to the next page, you will see that there is even then was an exception that took most seamen out, so that while the committee did broaden the bill, it did not broaden it to the full point of including seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.281" offset="6548459">The best explanation of this chain that I can find is that the Committee did not wish to incorporate in to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act, the maritime but local distinction of the Rohde case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.731" offset="6710314">Well, I think that if we -- I think that it must have had served one or two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.686" offset="6734137">One is that it was put in primarily as a recital of the reasons for enacting the statute as it were to add the saying there in coverage, in the coverage section that we have to act because Jensen and the other cases have excluded the state jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.400" offset="6816998">And this interpretation is certainly supported by the view -- by the fact that the committee report refers to Jensen and Knickerbocker Ice but neither on the committee of reports or anywhere else was there a references to the maritime but local doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.677" offset="6902053">Indeed, perhaps you gain some slight additional strength from the fact that when the Senate Bill was read on the House floor, they simply stopped reading it after occurring on the navigable waters of the United States and nobody attributed any significance to this recital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.133" offset="6975927">Now, if it must be given some substitutive meanings as of that time, I would say that it was intended to cover the situation involved in the Nordenholt Corporation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.130" offset="7027858">To with -- to make it clear that the longshoreman who was injured on the dock, reaching in the navigable waters, belong to the state rather than under the Federal Act because if you had left that out, it would certainly have been possible to argue that an injury upon a fixed structure, reaching out in the navigable water, was an injury on navigable waters just as much as it appeared on the floating structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.187" offset="7164113">Those seem to me taking this now as you have to interpret it as of the -- as of 1927, as to the two most likely interpretations of the words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.104" offset="7219806">The legislative history in the House does not require the same detailed exposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.732" offset="7250317">It's enough to say simply this, in the House the movement was only for expanding comfort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.474" offset="7281246">Indeed, the original House Bill expanded in coverage to the point where seamen and masters were included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.031" offset="7311548">It apparently was impossible in view of the legislative situation than existing to enact such a bill in an effort to get a bill properly enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.085" offset="7355747">There was a return to the Senate floor and that was what the bill became -- and that was the bill that became the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.912" offset="7383019">Now, the point that I'm trying to make is that all of the -- except for seamen, all the changes in language were consistent with the notion of expanding the federal coverage to the full extent of admiralty jurisdiction and that there were certainly nothing to indicate beyond the fact that the Rohde case was on the books since that's an indication but there's nothing beyond that bare fact to indicate that the Congress attributed any importance to the maritime but local exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.369" offset="7536828">Now of course, coming at the statute today, 35 years later, we think that it is not to be interpreted as it might have been in 1927 or 1928, even so, we would have had a pretty good case then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.599" offset="7601716">But the later decisions, the growth, the revolution of the statute, make it all together plain that the maritime but local doctrine is not a limitation upon the coverage of the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.920" offset="7675068">The first case that we think establishes that proposition is Parker against Motor Boat Sales Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.213" offset="7708191">You will recall that in that case, a janitor named porter who was employed to work on land about the premises in someone who was selling out boat motors and small boats went upon a single boat ride with his superior to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.720" offset="7778304">It was said, as a look out for any possible obstructions in the James River.He fell overboard and was drowned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.279" offset="7816443">The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit set aside an award made by the Deputy Commissioner in favor of the widow upon the ground that the state could award compensation under the doctrine that the accident while maritime was a local concern and this really, I think, not the slightest precedent but that it was on that ground the maritime but local exception that the Court of Appeals had acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.588" offset="7925739">Nevertheless, this Court reversed and sustained the award of compensation, and while the opinion is not explicit upon that point, it seems to us that it rather clearly repudiates the whole maritime but local doctrine as a measure of the coverage of the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.567" offset="8005674">There was no discussion of the maritime but local test, on the Rohde case and others like it were not cited, the opinion below, I think, would've been very persuasive if these were the tips.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.497" offset="8061367">Instead, this Court held very simply that the proviso, the concluding language that I've sought to direct your attention to several times, referring the cases where recovery might be had by state law, did not provide an exception, large enough to cover the Parker case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.835" offset="8134719">The commentators and the lower courts have -- with rather complete uniformity, interpreted the Parker case as rejecting the maritime but local doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.188" offset="8196159">Professor Larson and his book on Workmen's Compensation says, this decision by the highest Court appear to scrap the local exception to maritime employment but the relation to navigation and commerce of an unauthorized print in a tiny outward motor might seem to approach the vanishing point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.850" offset="8278810">The second case, which if necessary, puts this proposition beyond dispute is the case of Pennsylvania Railroad against O'Rourke to which I referred earlier in answer to some questions from Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.531" offset="8345475">You will recall that it involved the freight brakemen in the yards of the Pennsylvania Railroad at jury's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.592" offset="8377762">The argument and decision in the Second Circuit had been inter -- had been directed to the proposition that the place where the injury occur because it had occurred on navigable waters was not decisive and that it was necessary to inquire into the character of the employment and the opinion below went on in the respondent's argument in defense of it was that if the employment was not maritime, the Federal Act had no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.636" offset="8513912">Now, this argument is essentially the same as the argument that was made in Rohde and the other old maritime but local cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.524" offset="8557484">In Grant Smith-Porter against Rohde itself, the emphasis was on the character of what the employee was hired to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.365" offset="8596877">Now, the contract for constructing the Ahala that was the vessel he was working on, the Court said was not maritime and also the uncompleted structure upon which the accident occurred was lying in navigable waters, neither Rohde's general employment or his activities at that time had any relation to navigation or commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.628" offset="8677857">And in that opinion, the Court said with reference to Jensen and similar cases, in each of them, the employment or contract was navigable in the cha -- it was maritime in the character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.347" offset="8724773">Here, the parties contracted with reference to the state statute and the Alaska Packers' case, another leading exposition of the maritime but local doctrine is written even more explicitly in terms of the fact that the employee who in that case had been injured pushing a vessel in the navigable waters had been hired to work about a cannery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.229" offset="8824247">It was a dead season and he was a cannery worker the Court had said and therefore the Local Compensation Act could apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.843" offset="8858728">The similarity between the two arguments, the argument by the -- in the O'Rourke case and the argument in the maritime but local cases, had been noted in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.030" offset="8911496">Indeed, it expressly referred to the Rohde case and indicated that in its judgment, Rohde was an outlaw under the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.960" offset="8951202">And the Rohde case and others were cited not unnaturally in the briefs in this Court, in the O'Rourke case, for the proposition that the Federal Act would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.866" offset="8998849">Never the -- nevertheless, this Court squarely repudiated the test which calls for one look at the character of the employment and indicated, we are clear that the emphasis of the nature of respondent's duties here misses the month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.485" offset="9065305">The statute applies by its own terms when the employer has any employees engaged in maritime service than going on the exclusive coverage of Section 903.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.363" offset="9116818">That's the one we are arguing about, 905, extends to an employee of an employer made liable by 904 when he is injured in the course of his employment on navigable water and we have those same three facts, an employee of an employer covered by the act, injured in the course of his employment on navigable waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.537" offset="9673540">There are certainly instances in which the state may grant compensation where the injury occurs under circumstances where the federal law might apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.337" offset="9732681">The clearest illustration is the case of the work on the repair of a vessel where it has been squarely held even though the vessel is afloat on navigable water as in the Baskin case out on the West Coast that the state law may apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.185" offset="9804152">But so, Justice Douglas is not only obviously right but I appreciate him calling into my attention, it seems to me that that statement, however, is too broad and simply does not accord with the precedents in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.495" offset="9881370">I may point out that these three facts that I've sought defect towards, that I've sought to emphasize have been applied Justice Stewart as you recalled earlier in cases where the clearer question was one of the coverage of the Federal Act and whether an award on the Federal Act should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.209" offset="9980217">Thus in this Dixie Sand and Gravel case on the Sixth Circuit stated very categorically in an opinion on which -- from which there was no descent on this point that given these three facts, then the federal statute apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.847" offset="10050748">And I think that it's a -- this is rather clearly the rule not only in Fourth and Sixth Circuit but the Ninth Circuit has held that the maritime with local test does not applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.860" offset="10430777">Speaking of this category of new construction, I think the facts as to the decisions and law are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.252" offset="10472364">First, there are no cases upholding federal coverage as applied to new construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.080" offset="10511653">We have to concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.263" offset="10520430">Second, this is not an area in which it is practicable to ascertain what the practice of the Deputy Commissioner has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.061" offset="10571630">The awards are not filed in a way that they are digested or analyzed and you simply can't run it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.544" offset="10601514">On the other hand, I think that I must acknowledge that probabilities are that there were not any significant number of awards and compensation because I suppose that they would have been taken to courts in view of the decisions if there has been, although I think that's a little speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.298" offset="10684583">I think I have to worsen it on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.947" offset="10703182">So that Judge Brown's -- if limited sufficiently, Judge Brown's reasoning is correct.I would make these points in reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.131" offset="10767862">In the first place, I think the notion that an exact pre-1927 president removed something from the area of doubt, has been thoroughly repudiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.697" offset="10826167">The more Baskin cases, are the best illustrations and indeed the difficulties into which Judge Brown's search for certainty in the pre-1927 precedents leads one, are very well illustrated by his own opinion as I indicated earlier, he said in the Fifth Circuit, the rule is, I'm referring to page 50 of the opinion, in the face of some state court decisions which we have expressly declined to approve or follow, have we spoken in positive terms as to ship repairers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.758" offset="10982379">A ship repairer is not in the twilight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.493" offset="10993351">He is in the federal domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.674" offset="11002023">The State Act may not validly imply but this is just flatly inconsistent with the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.012" offset="11031385">So that's one thing that conventions made that to say that certainty was given by the pre-1927 decision is not really proved in a realistic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.581" offset="11089690">Second, I can't help noting also perhaps it's not with significance that the Rohde case itself is distinguishable on these facts and indeed the opinion that some of the Deputy Commissioners apparently relied on is also distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.512" offset="11161370">The Rohde case dealt with a man who worked on new construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.698" offset="11230124">Again, the only case which followed Rohde early under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act, was a case in the Fourth Circuit and Judge Brown himself acknowledges that that case has not been followed in the Fourth Circuit, not in the narrow sense in which we were talking earlier but in the sense of its broader rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.907" offset="11326986">Again, the distinction between new construction and repair has been clearly repudiated in the case of dry docks and marine ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.248" offset="11372335">Now I see no greater reason for applying it to the construction of ships than there is for applying it to the construction of dry docks and marine ways.</text>
