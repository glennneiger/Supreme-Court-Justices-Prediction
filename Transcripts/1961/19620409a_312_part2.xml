            <text syncTime="10.708" offset="146160">I have I believe, if Your Honors please, only about three minutes so I will attempt to summarize what I've like -- would've like to say at greater length if I will not so interested in asking Your Honor's questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.585" offset="197674">And the other is this, we do make this distinction and we stand by it that an attorney at law has the right to advice his clients as to the invalidity in his opinion of a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.414" offset="248978">Now, when he goes beyond doubt and instructs them to disobey which we feel the -- the record will amply bear itself that he is guilty of contempt, that the hearing which he had, which was punctuated Your Honor by a numerous interruptions, a procedure with which I may respectfully suggest Your Honors are not too unfamiliar was not conducted with the decorum which would -- we would have chosen but we do believe that substantial justice has been done, that the man stated repeatedly that his counsel stated in his stead repeatedly that he had advised the disobedience of a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.653" offset="425984">The issue to us Your Honors is clear, shall an attorney who believes perhaps in good faith that a court order is invalid, use the regular orderly judicial processes and attack that order through filing a proper motion and asking for a hearing or shall he take it upon himself to determine what the result would be upon that motion for a dissolution of a restraining order and that the rest to being repetitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.971" offset="567254">Again, I repeat, the words of the Supreme Court of Ohio, "rightfully instruct his clients to disobey that order."</text>
            <text syncTime="124.056" offset="599646">We do not believe he can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.823" offset="610617">We have no personal feeling in this case or whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.106" offset="623783">We are here in a nominal capacity not as a prosecuting attorney and assistant prosecuting attorney of Lucas County, Ohio but merely because habeas corpus, because of the nature of the remedy as directed to the sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.831" offset="674670">We have no better start with this young man.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.018" offset="995453">There's been some issue made of the absence of a motion to dissolve or its consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.108" offset="1031816">I'll just remind the Court that it was at 4 o'clock on the afternoon -- Friday afternoon prior to declaration day that the lawyer conferred by telephone or reported by telephone to his clients in Chicago the status of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.714" offset="1106213">That was after the court -- lower court had twice failed to carry out its assurances to the petitioner about the petition and so forth and it was until the next Tuesday in the Court's chambers that the petitioner had an opportunity to present a motion to dissolve the temporary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.368" offset="1184893">Now, it is true under the Ohio law that when a motion for a temporary -- a motion is made to dissolve a temporary injunction that has to be with notice to -- to counsel on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.991" offset="1239333">So if you file a motion, the first thing you do is to go in to court and say, "I want to file a motion but I have to put on my notice," the time that it's set for hearing because you'd have to give the counsel to the other side notice when he should appear for hearing in the motion to dissolve a temporary injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.433" offset="1341106">Actually, it's the convenience mostly of the court calendar in addition to accommodating the lawyers if the court's calendar permits it.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.185" offset="1372139">But you see, because there wasn't any contact between the court at 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon until Tuesday afternoon, Monday being a holiday at which time he presented to the court or said to the court, and remember this is the unrefuted and uncontradicted testimony under oath of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.927" offset="1447058">I just want to read one paragraph of the record that's -- that preceded the part that you read Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.374" offset="1472867">Mr. Reagan opened the discussion and he and the judge talked for some time during that con -- which conversation the court concluded that it did not intend to reform the contract, feeling it necessary to advise the court of my position on the jurisdictional matter involved, I interrupt the conversation and I ask if I could say a few words, a request Judge McKay graciously granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.821" offset="1558653">I attempted to explain that the matter to him pointing out that I was there only to object to the jurisdiction of the Court and that my prime interest was to have the matter heard so that we could either appeal it or get it before the NLRB or get it where it belong.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.205" offset="1644231">As to what took place in the court's chambers when they set up this procedure of stipulations so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.660" offset="1674010">Judge McKay had suggested that I was obsessed with his point that Mr. -- and Mr. Reagan suggested that I will file a motion to vacate the restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.387" offset="1704939">And then to follow it immediately in the record what you read where the petitioner said “I have the restraining order and I'll be glad to set up -- we're going to have the file if the court will give us a hearing” and so forth, and because, that's the first time that he was before the court and could present one so that they can put the time in there, you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.616" offset="1773798">So actually, the respondent for some reason tries to read into this thing, an attitude on the -- of -- of defiance on the part of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.369" offset="1820818">This is the first time actually that there's ever been any claim made in this Court, it's not in the brief, I don't believe that -- that the attitude of the petitioner is one of defiance to constitute authority, there's not one thing in the record I -- I suggest that -- that indicates that the petitioner was trying to do anything other than to -- to get justice for his clients to find some means to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.851" offset="1934817">Now, here's all the petitioner did and it's on page 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.527" offset="1953520">He says -- and this is just one paragraph and there are two paragraphs that I'm reading but I think it elucidates what we're interested in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.628" offset="1981837">Operating on the -- on this conviction, meaning that he wasn't going to get a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.527" offset="1997511">This is the -- the petitioner's testimony in the Court of Appeals on his application for a writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.587" offset="2021752">We consult to the higher authorities to affirm the position that an order made by a court in a matter of which it had no jurisdiction is absolutely void.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.041" offset="2119555">I thereupon called Mr. Friedman in Chicago and advised him as to the status of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.641" offset="2141915">Mr. Friedman was the regional counsel for the union who was really the man who retained petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.410" offset="2165008">I explained to him that though it was possible to file a motion to vacate or to demur the petition that it was apparent from the action of the court that such a motion would not be set down for a hearing in the near future and that even if it were, an adverse ruling would seem most likely in view of the court's attitude would not be a final order and could not be appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.620" offset="2241808">I then told them if I were correct under the law that the order of the court was wholly invalid that the only alternative would be to find the order of the court on the hopes that Mr. Reagan would file contempt proceedings which would undoubtedly be heard immediately and from which we could instantly appeal to the Court of Appeals to determine the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.551" offset="2309622">Well that's the whole -- that's the -- that's what the -- that's the advice that he gave after which yourself will be in contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="637.118" offset="2651826">But then he goes on to explain that really the orders came from the superiors.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.922" offset="2667081">Now, the next -- it's the second day on the third where -- where it says, "I did."</text>

            <text syncTime="660.620" offset="2745866">The petitioner says, "Yes, I'm still representing -- oh I met my lawyer or something like that."</text>
            <text syncTime="665.419" offset="2765093">And then he said, "You also advised them to violate the order of the Court or however he can said it," he said, "I did."</text>
            <text syncTime="670.743" offset="2786304">Well, he mean -- sure I advised them that if they want to get a hearing, you have -- you take it in its full context, you just can't --</text>
