            <label>Mr. Harold A. Ward, III</label>
            <text syncTime="40.973" offset="267264">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.168" offset="276041">May the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.004" offset="279385">This is a habeas corpus proceeding which was instituted by the petitioner in the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.856" offset="306761">It was instituted to test the legality of the petitioner's detention by the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.161" offset="327973">The petitioner was convicted on two counts along with his wife who is also charged with two counts of incest and so-called fondling or lewd and lascivious behavior and trial took place on September 19th, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.391" offset="388890">It was a trial before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.409" offset="397040">Petitioner was not aided by counsel in the course of his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.376" offset="412923">His wife is not a party to the proceedings in this Court, thus, I will deal only with the allegation that's set forth concerning the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.438" offset="449076">Summarizing briefly, the allegations of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed in the Florida Court were as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.102" offset="479796">First, the petitioner is being illegally restrained by the State contrary both to the Florida Declaration of Rights and to the Fourteenth Amendment of United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.845" offset="522742">Second, the petitioner was arrested on November 5th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.704" offset="542177">He was held until September 8th, 1958 when he was tried before a jury on September 19th, 1958, convicted and sentenced to a term of from six months to 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.646" offset="594004">Petition alleged that the petitioner was completely without education and “cannot recount the ABCs” that he “did not posses the most elementary rudiments of criminal procedure”.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.959" offset="643218">He was held in solitary confinement so he alleged for five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.883" offset="658892">He was not advised of his right to arraignment without unnecessary delay and he was held without a charge against him from November 5th, 1957 to August 11th, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.226" offset="704240">He also alleged that he requested lie detector test that he did request defense counsel to assist him in his trial that he protested his innocence and his inability to conduct to defense, and that when he attempted to cross-examine the prosecuting witness, he was ordered to sit down.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.027" offset="771532">He also requested that he -- he also alleged that he requested blood test and that no medical doctor testified at the trial and further prosecution waited until after the birth of the prosecuting witness' child to fix the date with the alleged defense occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.947" offset="839137">Finally, he made a legal argument that the two crimes of fondling and incest cannot coexist under the Florida law and he prayed for issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.291" offset="880515">Florida Supreme Court issued such a writ referred to in this Court's recent opinion on McNeal versus Culver I believe is a provisional writ on June 16th, 1960 requiring the respondent to make a proper return to the petitioner's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.608" offset="949791">Summarizing again, the allegations of the return to the writ of habeas corpus, they were as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.009" offset="975391">First, the respondent held petitioner pursuant to a commitment predicated on a judgment and cent -- centered by the Florida trial court on September 19th, 1958 after a jury verdict against the petitioner on both counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.334" offset="1028681">Second, the petitioner was arrested on November 5th, 1957 on a warrant issued by the county judge, which was predicated on an affidavit charging the crimes of rape and fondling allegedly occurring on October 31st, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.343" offset="1092733">On August 8th, 1958, respondent alleged the grand jury returned an indictment against the petitioner charging the crimes of incest and fondling allegedly occurring on July 10th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.510" offset="1141426">And the prosecuting attorneys subsequently filed an information based on the indictment which is the document upon which petitioner was tried on September 19th.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.938" offset="1187088">The respondent asserted that -- in fact the petitioner waived the jury trial but nonetheless, the court required the submission of the issues to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.779" offset="1226480">Respondent denied that petitioner was totally unable to defend himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.921" offset="1243094">He denied that defense counsel was requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.141" offset="1255946">He denied that the court ordered the petitioner to sit down.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.348" offset="1268799">And he denied that lie detector and blood test were requested by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.753" offset="1290428">He affirmatively alleged that petitioner actively participated in the trial, and was carefully instructed by the trial court concerning both his state and his federal constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.201" offset="1332224">The respondent attached a transcript of the trial proceedings to the return along with certain other documents, the information, the judgment in sentence, the commitment, the affidavit upon which the original warrant was predicated, the warrant and the indictment of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.882" offset="1402859">The respondent concluded by denying all allegations of the petition that were not expressly admitted or dealt with in the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.888" offset="1434937">Petitioner then filed a return to the respondent's return in which he asserted that the transcript attached to the respondent's return affirmatively showed that no counsel took place -- were -- was present at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.911" offset="1495019">Also, that the record was silent with respect to petitioner's alleged request for the assistance of counsel, his protestation of innocence and his request for a lie detector test.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.851" offset="1538800">The petitioner also alleged in his return that the record showed, “Two proficient prosecutors were arrayed against these indigent and uneducated defendants.”</text>
            <text syncTime="369.324" offset="1580701">He concluded by stating that the record reflected the ignorance in the total inability of the petitioner to conduct any defense and further that it showed no affirmative evidence of -- of his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.035" offset="1631483">The Florida Supreme Court in an opinion, which it rendered on September 23rd, 1960, which is set forth at the back of the printed record in this Court, discharged the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.037" offset="1683519">It granted petitioner no hearing to establish the truth of his charges, rather, it examined the record before it, the petition -- the petitioner's return and the documents attached to the respondent's return.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.163" offset="1740048">The court noted in its opinion that the law of Florida does not require appointment of counsel for indigent defendants except in capital cases citing Section 909.21 of the Florida statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.390" offset="1788949">It also stated that wherever, our record shows that a defendant either has no counsel or fails to show whether or not he had counsel, it will be presumed that the defendant waived counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.667" offset="1842030">It recited that while the evidence in the record showed conclusively, and this was the Florida Supreme Court talking, “Conclusively, the petitioner was illiterate.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.134" offset="1875884">There was no showing that the petitioner suffered from lack of intelligence”, concluded that the evidence was ample to sustain the charge against petitioner and discharge the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.264" offset="1912456">Petitioner, thereafter, filed a motion on December 22nd, 1960 for leave to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus in this Court, and this Court treating the papers filed as a petition for a writ of certiorari granted the petition on June 19th, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.330" offset="1984658">In summary, I think it's fair to say that following facts or -- or undisputed both from the petition and from the return in the documents attached to the return from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.327" offset="2028648">First of all, the petitioner was in fact arrested on November 5th, 1957, second that he was thereafter held until his trial on September 19th, 1958 that the information which was filed by the prosecuting attorney after the indictment by the grand jury was the basis for the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.023" offset="2119450">He was not tried on the grand jury's charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.773" offset="2130422">And I think it's also clear that counsel was not present, and it's not disputed, the counsel was not present at any stage of the trial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.501" offset="2161351">The record is silent completely with respect to whether or not petitioner requested the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.813" offset="2190608">It's likewise silent as to any advice by the Court to petitioner of -- of a right to counsel either counsel of his own choosing or counsel appointed by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.720" offset="2230209">The verbatim trans -- transcript of the proceedings, as the Court will note from the record, takes -- starts at a point when the jury has already been selected in the court, it is instructing the petitioner that he has the right to make an opening statement to that jury and there's nothing in the record about the proceedings prior to that time either at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.946" offset="2311189">There's nothing in the record with respect to an arraignment or anything of that sort when petitioner might have been advised of a right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.347" offset="2344730">So I think we -- we'll have to conclude that the record is silent on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.353" offset="2364792">The respondent in -- in his return to petitioner's writ does not allege any waiver by petitioner of the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.450" offset="2397184">That point was never presented as a factual matter to the support of the Supreme Court though the Florida Supreme Court did refer to the presumption of waiver in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.589" offset="2441697">And the respondent here in its brief does suggest that in fact, this presumption of waiver should control.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.515" offset="2477432">Finally, I think there isn't any question that petitioner is in fact and has established his illiteracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.080" offset="2499688">The Florida Supreme Court said on its examination of the record that there is no question that petitioner is illiterate.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.319" offset="2532603">Without going into detail review of the numerous opinions of this Court, culminating, I -- I noticed yesterday in your Chewning opinion concerning the denial of -- of due process, denial of Fourteenth Amendment guarantees by state criminal proceedings under circumstances such that the trial cannot be said to meet the test of fundamental fairness required by Betts versus Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.922" offset="2635107">I would like to -- to call to the Court's attention the -- the more or less clear, I think, proposition that among the circumstances that must be considered following the Betts versus Brady rule in determining whether or not fundamental fairness existed at any trial in state court proceedings, among those circumstances are necessarily the education, the mental capacity, the ability of the defendant to defend himself without the assistance of counsel at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.723" offset="2758301">I think also, it's -- it's completely clear, at this point as emphasized in the Chewning opinion yesterday, that the complexity of the issues that either are involved or that could have been involved in the trial are also of importance in all of the cases that I'll just mention briefly, McNeal versus Culver, and incidentally quite a few of these come from Florida courts, Hudson versus North Carolina, Cash versus Culver, Moore versus Michigan, Herman versus Claudy, Gibbs versus Burke, Wade versus Mayo, Uveges versus Pennsylvania, Massey versus Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.784" offset="2902497">There -- there are others cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.600" offset="2909811">And all of these cases, this Court has emphasized the importance of the -- the ability of the petitioner to defend himself in the phase of complex legal charges for his educational ability, his -- his educational background, his ability to defend himself, his ability, as in this case, to read or write to understand the nature of the charges against him are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.473" offset="3017226">Petitioner's basic argument is that his -- the circumstances of his conviction clearly were sufficient to bring back conviction within the rule of these cases, that he was in his trial denied the fairness required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="783.915" offset="3239058">I do argue, however, that if this Court should conclude and -- and I don't believe that it can on the basis of his allegation, but if the Court should conclude that the circumstances here were not sufficient to bring the case within the Betts versus Brady rule, then the Court should reexamine that rule because of the cases that have been decided since that time, and along the line suggested in the concurring opinion in McNeal versus Culver in last term.</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.161" offset="6732048">Well, I -- I will press the matter further, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.209" offset="6740198">I think I've probably done more than I should have already.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.102" offset="6751796">But I think that if I could just summarize the undisputed facts to see what would possibly be left open for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.741" offset="6786382">Now, perhaps what I'm really saying now is not that we should -- that the Court, as you say, open the jail door but that the Court should not infer that it's necessary for the Florida Supreme Court or for a judicial body appointed by it to conduct a full hearing on this matter because there's no dispute according to the Florida Supreme Court itself as to the illiteracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.159" offset="6880005">There's no dispute as to the lack of counsel, there's no dispute to the nature of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.093" offset="6899754">The only thing that I can see that there would be a factual argument on or dispute would be the possible issue of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.757" offset="6930369">And there was no allegation in the respondent's return that counsel was waived at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.612" offset="6957850">The first time that issue has been raised is -- is here and the Florida Supreme Court deals with it only as a presumption of waiver and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.720" offset="6990242">As far as I can see, the only issue that could be going into in a hearing on this petition would be that issue of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.544" offset="7017514">I see no reason for this Court to suggest by as it has in some instances in its opinions saying that the cause is remanded at least to give the petitioner a hearing or an opportunity to prove the -- the truth or falsity of the factual allegations that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.561" offset="7081566">I see no reason for that type of language in an opinion directing the -- the further proceedings below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.939" offset="7119078">I think that I haven't dealt it all yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.801" offset="7134542">Well, I have repeated the illiteracy and -- and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.308" offset="7152619">Anything about the complex issues that where either potentially or implicitly or -- or otherwise involved in the petitioner's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.795" offset="7190549">Again, continuing in an examination of the facts of this case under the Betts versus Brady rule and the rule of the cases establishing, further amplifying that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.497" offset="7237360">This petitioner, apparently, was convicted under what the Florida Supreme Court in the -- and it was locally called the Florida Child Molester Law, Chapter 801 of the Florida statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.712" offset="7286262">This particular law has a number of other provisions in it whereas the petitioner or counsel for the petitioner might have raised if he'd have counsel at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.436" offset="7325132">I don't believe that it is incumbent that we show here and the respondent's assertion in its brief but we couldn't show here that in fact, the trial judge would have granted any of the rights or procedures involved under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.550" offset="7381556">But nonetheless, had counsel been there, he could have made a number of approaches to the court by a way of motion for psychiatric or psychological examination for a commitment for treatment even for suspension of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.135" offset="7435891">And the language of the statute clearly spells out the broad authority of the trial judge in the case that falls under the child molester law to suspend the execution of judgment, if in his opinion the petitioner can best be rehabilitated by that method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.923" offset="7511019">There's -- there are number of other complications involved to the -- their separate statutes in Florida that make incest a crime, that make fondling a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.353" offset="7556786">These statutes are all purportedly incorporated by Section 801.02 of the child molester law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.666" offset="7590013">At least one case, this incorporation of the statute by another has been held by the Florida Supreme Court to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.609" offset="7617808">I don't know that that would have rendered any distinct advantage to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.160" offset="7640064">I can't tell now what might have happened, had some of these points been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.121" offset="7659813">But there were clearly points that could have been raised, procedures that could have been requested for this petitioner under Chapter 801, head counsel then present to request them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.773" offset="7702444">I think it's clear, too, that if you examine the record, there were only two witnesses against the petitioner and they were two of his children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.413" offset="7733060">He was forced with the necessity of cross-examining his own children as the only witnesses against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.761" offset="7754376">He was illiterate, of course, which was a handicap, but was further aggravated by the fact that he -- were members of his own family as sole witnesses against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.800" offset="7790529">An independent lawyer could certainly have done a better job on that or done a job at all if -- if we forget about the fact for the moment that petitioner was illiterate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.416" offset="7837027">There isn't any question if you -- if you look at the transcript that the cross-examination of these witnesses was totally inadequate when the petitioner was unable at all to meet the issues that were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.941" offset="7891153">For example, I -- I think I've set up the total cross-examination I have in my brief of both witnesses on page 14, the entire cross-examination of the prosecuting witness has set forth at the bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.247" offset="7948309">The question by Mr. Carnley was, “Carol Jean, you say your mother, she went and made arrangements to get the casket for your sister?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.573" offset="7977671">"Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.114" offset="7979865">"You are right sure now that she did?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.485" offset="7989269">“I am sure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.024" offset="7995434">“Well, I will tell the court, my wife was out at Mr. Joe Gayfer's house.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.561" offset="8009644">And then the court interrupted and said, “"Wait a minute, sir, you are testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.257" offset="8024377">You will have a chance to testify when the State rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.686" offset="8034095">Any questions you wish to ask your daughter, you are welcome to do it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.124" offset="8047888">Well, after that the petitioner didn't ask anymore questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.715" offset="8062203">That's the total cross-examination of the prosecuting witness that I have just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.324" offset="8080697">The total cross-examination by the prosecuting witness' wife has set forth on the top of page 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.516" offset="8105462">It's -- it's obvious that the issues involved in the testimony of these witnesses were totally overlooked by the petitioner if they were grasped at all and there was no evidence presented to the jury on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.267" offset="8156453">Incidentally, there is a point, I think, worth mentioning that in somewhat rambling testimony of the petitioner's wife in the short portion of the trial in which either petitioner or his wife was testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.163" offset="8216012">There were some indication that a lawyer might very well have raised the severe question of prejudice on the part of the prosecuting witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.340" offset="8248717">On page 53, for example, in Mrs. Carnley's testimony, she says, "We tried to be firmed with them, but it seemed like the more firm we got these two older kids, they couldn't stand the pressure, so they would, every time that their daddy would get after them or something or other about some of their doings, well, that oldest boy would say, "Well, Daddy, you will sure regret it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.261" offset="8328443">I will get even with you one way or the other.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.107" offset="8339832">Had there been counsel present why this line of questioning, cross-examination clearly could have been followed?</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.228" offset="8372328">Further and counsel been present why the petitioner might have realized when he took the witness stand on his own behalf, that doing so would sub -- subject him to cross-examination by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.342" offset="8416737">The State urges that the parties were completely and fully apprised of all of their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.818" offset="8442650">We've already noted that there's no evidence from the record that they were apprised of any right to be represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.703" offset="8466160">It's also clear in the trial itself that they weren't apprised of the fact that if they took the stand themselves, they would be subject to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.535" offset="8501478">They were told that anything they said could be held as self-incriminatory but they weren't told about the cross-examination nor were they told of their right to make instructions or to request instructions of the judge to be given to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.719" offset="8566262">There's no evidence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.365" offset="8576815">There is absolutely no point in the transcript to the proceedings where either of the -- either the petitioner or his wife made any objection to testimony on the part of either the States' witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.055" offset="8627597">In all of these ways, I think it's beyond question that counsel clearly could have been of a great deal of assistance and in fact that without counsel, the petitioners did not have an opportunity to adequately meet the charges against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.928" offset="8695097">In view of the position of the State on -- on possible waiver of this right to counsel is set forth in this -- the brief of the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.428" offset="8733132">I would like to say a word about this waiver issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.986" offset="8751313">The -- as I've said, the return of the respondent in the court below does not allege that the petitioner waived any right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.367" offset="8780884">There's no statement in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.393" offset="8784959">The only statement that could be related to it is the statement that petitioner did not request counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.016" offset="8811395">For the first time here, there's a suggestion I suppose on the basis of the language of the Florida Supreme Court that in fact there was a presumption applied by that court of waiver which is binding here in which petitioner was under a duty to overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.830" offset="8874715">Well, I think it's -- it's obvious at the outset and since petitioner didn't have a hearing below when of course he wasn't given any opportunity to overcome the presumption that is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.766" offset="8914422">But I think even beyond that and this goes again to the question of whether or not there would be anything served as a practical matter by having a hearing on this habeas corpus petition below, is -- is the fact that the presumption of waiver which is the only thing in this record that -- that presents any issue on waiver cannot constitutionally be applied by a state to deny a defendant in his right to fair hearing in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.575" offset="9037720">And this Court noted in Johnson versus Zerbst that, of course, that was a federal proceeding but it noted that waiver of fundamental constitutional rights is not something that's to be presumed and -- and again, in a subsequent case of Moore versus Michigan why it was pointed out that waiver is not to be lightly presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.404" offset="9124968">If a state could apply a conclusive presumption in the absence of a hearing that a defendant waived his right to counsel with no support in the record factually for such a presumption, why it's clear that this Court would, of course, cease to hear any cases of this sort or could cease to hear it because the presumption of waiver could conclusively be applied by the state below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.105" offset="9215770">There would be no opportunity for a petitioner to rebut that conclusive presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.706" offset="9238235">One additional word concerning the ability of the petitioner to defend himself at the trial, the Florida Supreme Court says in its opinion that even illiterate defendants may be intelligent about the common place things of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.094" offset="9307721">As I've stated in my brief, I -- I don't believe that we can conclude that a serious criminal trial carrying a sentence up to 20 years is one of the common place things of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.921" offset="9347009">I cannot believe that the types of issues that were involved here or such that an illiterate defendant regardless of his other abilities would've adequately been able to meet those issues and conduct a defense that could result in a successful -- that would be a successful defense or result in an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.655" offset="9426004">An illiterate defendant cannot examine the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.902" offset="9434990">He can't look at the information for among other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.430" offset="9449096">There's no basis for the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.331" offset="9460694">I respectfully submit that in spite of illiteracy, a defendant is able to conduct a defense in a serious criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.303" offset="9500609">Now, turning, if I could, to the question of, “What if this case doesn't come under Betts versus Brady or what if the Court should feel it permissible in this case to reexamine Betts versus Brady?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.377" offset="9560900">I would respectfully submit that the Court has already done that in effect in the decision in Griffin versus Illinois and Chandler versus Fretag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.495" offset="9597367">When you put those two cases together, I cannot conclude how the Court can -- can say that there is any life left in Betts versus Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.808" offset="9634565">Now, as I've said, it's not necessary to reach -- reach this issue but if we do reach it, why it's clear that under Chandler versus Fretag, Reynolds versus Cochran, in subsequent cases in this Court, a defendant who can afford his own lawyer has an unquestioned and unqualified right to be heard by that lawyer in state criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.914" offset="9723068">There's no -- no qualification on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.065" offset="9735607">It's also clear, I believe now, in view of Griffin versus Illinois that a defendant cannot be denied effective appellate review of his conviction by virtue of his inability to obtain funds to buy a transcript which a state may require as a prerequisite to review of that conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.370" offset="9812825">If it is a denial of equal protection or due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to deny appellate review equally to those who can or cannot afford transcripts required for that review, how can it be otherwise in that denial of due process to deny effective representation by counsel at the trial itself as between those who can afford counsel and those who cannot?</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.410" offset="9917001">It seems to me that the -- the importance of the trial as opposed to appellate review -- review really makes us a stronger case than -- than the Griffin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.961" offset="9963186">It's long been recognized that a state doesn't have to provide appellate review at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.369" offset="9980844">But it is now clear that if it does, why it must provide it on a basis that is available alike to reach in poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.515" offset="10009475">It cannot effectively cut off the right of appellate review to the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.654" offset="10029955">How then can a state effectively cut off the right to assistance of counsel at the trial to a man simply because he can't afford that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.183" offset="10064123">I would believe that putting these two cases together, Chandler versus Fretag, Griffin versus Illinois, that Betts versus Brady has implicitly at least been overruled by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.516" offset="10117413">Now, clearly has not been as such and I don't urge that it is essential at this Court reach this issue, but I certainly believe it is presented by this record and the Court could reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.066" offset="10155656">Now, why is it presented by the record?</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.266" offset="10164433">First of all, because the defendant alleged that he requested counsel from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.040" offset="10187525">Secondly, he alleged, though not very artfully and I recognized this, that he was an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.603" offset="10217827">The record doesn't reveal a specific statement by the defendant, “I am an indigent” in his petition for writ of habeas corpus, but it's clear through the inartful draftsmanship of it that he's saying that on page 3, for example, in the original petition, he says, “Courts of competent jurisdiction withheld without exception to the Court is devoid of jurisdiction when the demand for counsel has denied the poor,” arguing his lack of funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.607" offset="13501837">We represent the appellee, Mr. Cochran, he's head of our Division of Correction, in this particular course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.928" offset="13547081">The -- firstly, in order to lay the foundation for the argument we have to go to as what was the general characteristic of the overall proceedings in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.830" offset="13602670">Now, the presumption is on the petitioner here and it's fair for the Court to assume that as a matter of fact, the judge and the prosecution were in rapport with the defendant as far as complete fair play, unless the record shows something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.005" offset="13683440">Now, just as a sideline, we have -- which has no bear in direct judge has written Division of Correction on behalf of this petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3411.375" offset="13748851">For the Court to come to this conclusion, I asked only that they consider the record as before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.800" offset="13774555">I feel as I go down what occurred in this trial, the Court will come to the conclusion that if any of the individuals on this Court had been sitting as judge on that case that they could have done more -- no more except for the appointment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.074" offset="13843623">They could have done no more than that particular judge did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.133" offset="13879881">I think -- isn't that perhaps your -- your opponent's point that a -- that a judge just isn't in the position to do for a defendant no matter how fair he is or how lacking in animus towards the defendant, he was in the position to represent the defendant because he was there as a judge, not as an -- not as an arbiter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3465.119" offset="13963891">Yes, Your Honor, that -- that would be his point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.154" offset="13976012">But my point is that under Betts versus Brady, if everything in the overall proceedings is completely fair to the defendant and the only factor is the lack of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.268" offset="14032436">Then such factor will not be sufficient to reverse the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.488" offset="14049364">So our first approach is to show that all the factors are fair except that one point of failure to appoint counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.531" offset="14097533">First, we look at the record on page 31 to explain to the defendants if they have the right to make an opening statement, that they can sit back and wait until the State makes their case and then they can make an opening statement to the jury before placing on their defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.551" offset="14165556">The defendant chose to -- to wait.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.931" offset="14175065">They will later be shown if they did make an opening statement to the jury before they put on their defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.869" offset="14206830">The defendants did cross-examine as shown on page 41 and 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.101" offset="14227728">Counsel for petitioner has shown that such a cross-examination was very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.876" offset="14258866">However, the court has pointed out that it's possible that no attorney could have done more but the big factor is it is quite possible that many attorneys would have come to an independent conclusion, “Let's not cross-examine this witness to a further extent to get this exact testimony before the jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.668" offset="14350085">And what was done by a petitioner or about -- was that which might have been done by many attorneys to what not furthering the evidence of the prosecution witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.454" offset="14413197">Now, what did petitioner temp to do in this cross-examination?</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.725" offset="14430229">He attempted to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.228" offset="14436289">He wanted to show that there was an inconsistency on what the witness said to what the witness said that he was alone whether that her mother was in another section of -- of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.984" offset="14479339">He wanted to show that that was not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.811" offset="14490624">He laid the foundation and later on in his testimony, he brings out this to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.561" offset="14521657">Now, there is no inflammatory comment by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.567" offset="14557602">When they attempt to bring out another crime on page 49, it simply, “Had you been convicted of another crime?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.097" offset="14587800">“Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.330" offset="14592711">“How many?”</text>

            <text syncTime="3623.840" offset="14598771">No further whatsoever, not -- no dwelling on it, always it's just -- there's nothing to stir up animosity between the jury and this man which the prosecution does in his cross-examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3648.356" offset="14696782">Yes, sir, it was brought out further on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.033" offset="14739519">The right not to testify was explained in detail to the defendant, his constitutional right not to incriminate himself which explained on page 49 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.030" offset="14787480">Now, keep in mind that all of these arguments about what a counsel might have done as the same arguments that could be used if counsel was present to say, “What could better counsel have done?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.604" offset="14861772">Now, the explanation of the closing and opening rights for making the argument to the jury was given in detail by the court on the record on page 61 of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.357" offset="14900851">They made arguments to the jury as shown by the record on page 62 of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.971" offset="14927287">In the charge on page 62, the court put out in detail how the burden was on the State to prove and how there had to be beyond unreasonable doubt and on the record in page 68, a coercion the jury not to consider testimony given for impeachment as indic -- indication of the guilt of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.561" offset="15029582">We therefore submit that when we consider the overall proceedings of this trial, the judge did every thing possible that any judge could do except the appointment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.200" offset="15080155">And that the one lack of fair play in this trial is the failure to appoint counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.183" offset="15104084">And we're now going to go into the considerations given to Betts versus Brady and whether this case should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.442" offset="15145148">We feel that, as of this point, the case falls under Betts v. Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.293" offset="15168554">Furthermore, in Betts v. Brady there was at least support for the indigents of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.320" offset="15188616">There is no support in this record as far as not the testimony is concerned but as far as the allegations of the defendant that he was indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.755" offset="15230412">He certainly didn't make it in his petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.387" offset="15248906">They have attempted to rely on a statement and what is essentially a reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.160" offset="15275969">And that statement is that is shown by the record that two strong attorneys were aligned against these indigent uneducated defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.234" offset="15332289">Certainly, a denial of such statement does not come to issue of the indigents of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.983" offset="15359352">The statement is, as to whether the attorneys were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.722" offset="15386311">Now, the first reason that we do not think this Betts v. Brady should be reversed in this particular case is because of the effect this Court has given the Mapp v. Ohio decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.846" offset="15438764">Now, in the Mapp v. Ohio decision where the Court reversed these prior holdings on the evidence of miscibility of illegally obtained evidence in state courts, the court here was confronted with not a collateral attack on the judgement -- not a collateral attack on the judgement but a direct proceeding, appellate proceeding on the judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.241" offset="15552345">The court has refused to apply that change of law, that change of law to convictions that took place before the Mapp holding, the federal system has.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.979" offset="15607306">Therefore, we have here the situation where if we were to change Betts v. Brady, if we had changed Betts v. Brady one year ago, this petitioner could not here be attacking his lack of counsel and the urging that Betts v. Brady had been reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4742.870" offset="19074800">Now, this right attempted to show that -- that the right to appeal if we make this similar to the right of appeal where you have to be given that right and that the burden is on the petitioner to show his need for the right and the court has no duty to point out that he has the right and therefore, the same analogy should be present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.691" offset="19154108">We also believe that this is similar to a jury trial requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.657" offset="19173961">This is a procedural requirement of a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.089" offset="19191724">Very similar to jury trial and is in fact located, if I remember correctly, in the same part of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.457" offset="19221191">The court has held that this proceeding -- that jury proceeding is not required of the States if they have great discretion in the exercise of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.443" offset="19261106">And certainly, where the similarity between jury and the counsel here, the two were very comparable and these too is a procedural aspect that the court should be given great discretion unless they denied the man's right to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.230" offset="19340309">Now, we urge if the man is feeble-minded, if the man is in fact below 21, if the man for any factor other than education, cannot represent himself, let's take people not mind in this, in minority, a court very likely would point a guardian in a civil trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.112" offset="19439783">As understood, the man doesn't -- can't represent himself and that a hearing from himself is not a hearing from -- of his course.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.073" offset="19467682">But this particular man here is given full recognition under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.066" offset="19487640">He is entitled by this Constitution to be president of the United States except for the manner of vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.923" offset="19511045">There is no educational requirement whatsoever for him to hold that post.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.064" offset="19527659">As I've said he could be on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.296" offset="19544586">Education is not given constitutional recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.255" offset="19564440">The very -- we feel the very beginning that we feel now education might possibly over emphasized and certainly in the beginning when the Constitutional was developed, and now, the requirements that you have in education are very few in this Constitution and that shown not for for this Court or not for presidential office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.740" offset="19658376">Now, when his right to counsel that's developing under the Sixth Amendment, anyone had a provision as long as -- as far as 1838 that you could have no counsel come into court to represent you in a felony charge.</text>
