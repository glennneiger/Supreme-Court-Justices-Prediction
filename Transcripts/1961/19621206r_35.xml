            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 35, Edward Yellin, Petitioner, versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.312" offset="188583">Mr. Rabinowitz.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="23.436" stopTime="307.513">
            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="23.436" offset="197151">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.398" offset="217004">The petitioner was convicted of a violation of Section 192 of Title 2 for his refusal to answer several questions put to him by a subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities at a hearing held in Gary, Indiana in February 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.445" offset="297148">The alleged subject under inquiry was Communist infiltration for basic industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.178" offset="320136">And it was the tenth investigation that the Committee had held over a period of some four or five years under that Title, to say nothing of course of hundreds of investigations that the Committee has held on related subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.363" offset="388786">He testified between the Watkins and the Barenblatt decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.073" offset="411669">And in refusing to answer the questions put to him, he expressly relied on the Watkins’ decision on the vagueness of the authorizing resolution upon his rights under the First Amendment and on the lack of the jurisdiction of the Committee over the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.293" offset="488573">Like Barenblatt and Braden and Wilkinson and Russell and the other cases that were decided by this Court at the last term, he did not rely on the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.103" offset="539773">He was not indicted or tried until after the Barenblatt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.816" offset="558686">At that time he was found guilty and received the maximum sentence of one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.818" offset="582614">Prior to his testimony, he had been a steelworker.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.952" offset="599228">At the time of his testimony before the Committee, he was an undergraduate engineering student at Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.669" offset="626082">Since then he has been a graduate student and a candidate for his doctor’s degree at the University of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.683" offset="658056">It doesn’t appear in the record of course but the fact is that in 1961, he received a fellowship from the National Science Foundation which was taken from him when Congressman Scherer made a speech about it on the floor of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.372" offset="708838">And in 1962, he received the fellowship from the National Institutes of Health which was similarly taken from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.192" offset="736110">He is however receiving a scholarship from Johns Hopkins University, not out of public but of private funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.449" offset="769128">The case was argued at the last term and is now here on reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.649" offset="793997">It differs from the Russell and other cases that were decided by this Court at the last term because this indictment was drawn by the United States Attorney in the Northern District of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.189" offset="844152">And he apparently used his own forms for drawing an indictment and did not fall into the error that the court found fatal in the cases decided at the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.369" offset="892844">I shall argue both constitutional and unconstitutional grounds for reversal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.726" offset="918235">There are facts in this case that were not present in Barenblatt, Wilkinson and Braden.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.217" offset="944253">And even one of my constitutional arguments may not require a reversal of Barenblatt, Wilkinson and Braden, at least I may have found a crevice in which I can find some shelter.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.719" offset="1006216">But if I have, it’s a narrow crevice and I shall ask the Court here to reconsider the Barenblatt, Wilkinson, and Braden cases because I suggest that those cases were bad law.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.120" offset="1079881">I must say that the brief on reargument, a new brief on reargument submitted by the Government in this case gives my some comfort in that regard because I think that the Government recognizes that issues such as these are never finally decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.115" offset="1155845">At page 26 of the Government brief, the Solicitor General says, after discussing Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson, under normal circumstances therefore and perhaps in the present instance, it would be enough to show that the case at bar is indistinguishable from the controlling precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.863" offset="1230869">We are mindful, however, that the present controversy involves the most delicate and dangerous of the court’s responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.654" offset="1269948">The Solicitor General then goes on to describe what those delicate and dangerous responsibilities are, I disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.378" offset="1300877">And I’ll come back to that a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.578" offset="1309654">But the Government goes on to say, “For these reasons, we would be derelict in our duty despite the precedence”.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.996" offset="1339329">I’ll come to the reasons in a few minute -- at the close Your Honor because I think that the reasons are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.265" offset="1360436">There is a vital difference of opinion between the Solicitor General and I myself with respect to the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.966" offset="1383215">I have no intent to omit it, I will show you.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.109" offset="1399829">“For these reasons, we would be derelict in our duty despite the precedence if we fail to show in some detail the constitutional foundation for the congressional investigation into the subject.”</text>
            <text syncTime="335.980" offset="1447267">I too feel that there are delicate and dangerous issues involved here and that this kind of issues can never be left rest as certainly the history of this Court has shown.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.821" offset="1550608">The petitioner was subpoenaed to appear on February 10th, 1958 in Gary.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.511" offset="1573386">On February 6th, counsel sent a telegram, addressed to counsel for the Committee reading as follows, “Undersigned represents Edward Yellin and Nicholas Busic.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.376" offset="1636916">On their behalf I request executive session in lieu of open session.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.948" offset="1655202">Testimony needed for legislative purposes can be secured in executive session without exposing witnesses to publicity”.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.386" offset="1692923">The response by -- signed by Mr. Arens, the Staff Director of the Committee read, “Reurtel requesting executive session in lieu of open session for Edward Yellin and Nicholas Busic.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.585" offset="1761677">Your request denied”.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.115" offset="1775783">The request was made in the first place pursuant to Rule IV-A of the Rules of the Committee on Un-American Activities which reads as follows: “If a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee, duly appointed as provided by the rules of the House of Representatives, believes that the interrogation of a witness in a public hearing might endanger national security or unjustly injure his reputation, or the reputation of other individuals, the Committee shall interrogate such witness in an executive session for the purpose of determining the necessity or advisability of conducting such interrogation thereafter in a public hearing”.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.091" offset="1955715">At the hearing, counsel for Yellin attempted to introduce this exchange of telegrams into the record so that the matter could be called to the attention of the Committee and would appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.706" offset="1998242">Congressman Walter who was presiding refused to permit counsel to address the Committee at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.688" offset="2030111">At the trial, he said that he never saw the telegram.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.545" offset="2041501">He didn’t know what they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.132" offset="2047875">He didn’t see him at the time of the hearing and as a matter of fact, he hadn’t even seen them until he got on the stand at the trial and when I showed him those telegrams, during the course of this examination, he said, that was the first time he saw them.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.038" offset="2143483">In the view of Congressman Walter’s express on the witness stand, this was all a big misunderstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.575" offset="2169710">He said the telegram should’ve been sent to him and not to the counsel for the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.578" offset="2189667">Moreover, he said, Mr. Arens, who denied the request, had no authority to deny any such request.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.919" offset="2211088">Only the Committee had the authority to deny such a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.476" offset="2225298">He said and I quote, “I am sure this could not have happened had you addressed the telegram to me”.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.191" offset="2256123">He further said that he had he known of the request for an executive session, “We might have a different situation today”.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.210" offset="2296247">As a matter of fact, Congressman Walter said, that the Committee had concede -- considered calling the petitioner on executive -- petitioner an executive session.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.627" offset="2341909">And this appears at page 70 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.310" offset="2356642">And he said, “Well, the Committee had already passed on the question of whether or not we would hear Mr. Yellin at a session”, when the purpose of calling him was discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.862" offset="2386840">Then it was decided then that the rule with respect to an executive session was not applicable because the investigator and I might say it was Mr. Collins, a former FBI agent, who developed this entire matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.630" offset="2445876">And we were willing to accept his story with respect to the proposed testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.706" offset="2470222">I gather from this not completely clear answer that Congressman Walter was saying that an executive session was denied because they had a very reliable investigator and they were prepared to take his word for what the witness was going to be called for and an executive session was therefore not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.853" offset="2554755">Now, that of course is not the standard that is required by the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.642" offset="2573981">The rules say that an executive session shall be called when in the opinion of the Committee, the interrogation of a witness at a public hearing might endanger national security or unjustly injure his reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.216" offset="2636257">The Government points out that the witness has no right to an executive session and I think this is true.</text>

            <text syncTime="1127.783" offset="4614457">Nevertheless, I think it's a perfectly sound point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.551" offset="4629608">It was not argued in Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.651" offset="4637968">It was not argued in Wilkinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.533" offset="4645491">It was argued in Braden but apparently not forcefully enough to -- Mr. Boudin argued it, not forcefully enough to require any response by the majority of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.931" offset="4695124">In all candor, I must say that it was considered and considered at very great length in the dissenting opinion in Barenblatt although it had not been argued in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.912" offset="4735039">And I must also confess with candor that much of my argument is cribbed from that dissenting opinion, but I would like to make it nevertheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.457" offset="4773177">The Government points out that Section 192 reads pretty clearly and I suppose it does, every person who having been summoned as a witness by the authority of either House of Congress to give testimony or to produce papers upon any matter under inquiry before the House, or who having appeared refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry shall be guilty of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.988" offset="4875368">The Rumely case, however, interpreted that statute as applying only to a situation in which the question is asked on the matter concerning which the Committee has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.973" offset="4943287">And therefore, that statute I suggest, must be read as meaning that a witness who having appeared refuses to answer any question within the jurisdiction of the Committee is guilty of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.492" offset="5013295">That's what Rumely said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.454" offset="5025207">And therefore, we must go back to the jurisdiction of the Committee in order to ascertain what the statute means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.114" offset="5059793">It's analogous to a statute which says it shall be a violation of law for anyone to violate the regulation of the State Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.709" offset="5094170">If the regulation of the State Department is unclear, the statute is unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.496" offset="5117367">Now, it is true that this Court at some length in Barenblatt did consider the meaning of Rule 11, the authorizing resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.122" offset="5171911">And as a result of rather extensive research, all of which appears at page 120 of the Barenblatt decision, it found the meaning for the language which the Chief Justice had been unable to find in the Watkins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.271" offset="5232410">And it said that, as I understand the decision, the words Un-American propaganda activity really means the investigation of Communist activities generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.684" offset="5282147">Congressman Walter, when he was on the stand at Gary, expanded this a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.893" offset="5302941">He said that the words “Un-American propaganda activity” means and I quote, “Any activity that is inimical to the best interests of the United States”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.787" offset="5354559">Congressman Walter is the ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee and I should think that his views on the subject would be worthy of at least some consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.311" offset="5396668">I am not disposed at this time to argue what that resolution means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.035" offset="5423522">We are -- I am not arguing now the question of pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.123" offset="5439822">I am not now arguing the question of whether this particular investigation was within the scope of the Committee's jurisdiction as that jurisdiction has been determined by this Court to be in Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.876" offset="5494888">I am directing myself only to the question of whether this statute read as a criminal statute with Rule 11 was sufficiently clear and certain to justify to be able to sustain a criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.823" offset="5574614">Now, I submit that Section 192 read in the light of Rumely as with the emendation of Rule 11 does not meet the standards of -- retried to this Court of a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.717" offset="5646190">The court has formulated these standards on many occasions and let me just refer to the standard applied in the Connelly case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.521" offset="5685478">The statute is bad, said the Connelly case, if and I quote, “Men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ at its application”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.320" offset="5740648">Well, men of uncommon intelligence have been compelled to guess at its meaning and have differed in its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.561" offset="5789654">Aside from Congressman Walter, this Court has divided on what the statute means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.599" offset="5825808">I have never heard of a case and the Government cites no case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.043" offset="5843571">I don't believe there is any case in which a court has examined the legislative history in order to uphold a conviction on a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.988" offset="5883277">And it seems to me on its face impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.195" offset="5896129">If a statute is clear on its face, legislative history is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.294" offset="5920580">And if a statute is unclear on its face, a criminal statute used to sustain a conviction, then most certainly, legislative history cannot be used in order to clarify that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.616" offset="5981811">Now I repeat, we are not here concerned with whether the Committee had jurisdiction although this subject under inquiry and I am willing although I don't think it did, nevertheless, I am willing to concede for the purposes of this argument that it had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.099" offset="6043773">Had there been a subpoena and the motion was made to vacate the subpoena versus the motion perhaps should've been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.685" offset="6070105">The Committee had a right to hold this hearing and to call these witnesses, I will stipulate to all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.858" offset="6106781">But here we have a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.257" offset="6120364">And a man cannot be held criminally liable on the basis of a statute which combines the fairly clear language of Section 192 with the most obscure and meaningless language of Rule 11, language on which as I say, many, many people have difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.650" offset="6217958">If there ever was a case of blurred signposts to criminality concerning which the court spoke in United States against the CIO, this is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.544" offset="6265501">It would be bad enough if Rumely were the only gloss that had been placed on Section 192.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.302" offset="6304580">But this Court has placed still another gloss on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.223" offset="6320253">And in the Barenblatt case, the court found that these questions could be asked depending on the way a balance felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.802" offset="6382529">And when this is added to Section 192, it seems to me that to require a person to guess as to whether he is supposed to answer, whether he is required to answer a question or not, is far beyond reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.807" offset="6462568">And that brings me to balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.520" offset="6485452">There has been so much written and discussed about the balancing doctrine as set forth in the Barenblatt case that I hesitate somewhat to take up the time of the Court to discuss this matter in detail again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.468" offset="6549295">Not only have there been a majority and minority opinions of this Court on a -- in a number of important cases, but there have been law review articles written on it and books written on it, and the subject is really been discussed most extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.578" offset="6605720">Nevertheless, it is an issue in the case and a very important issue.Petitioner contends that the balancing theory is unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.310" offset="6652635">But it is as of today the rule of this Court, and therefore, we must try to live with it and we tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.952" offset="6695163">I would like to read although perhaps the recollections of the Court doesn't need refreshing, I'd like to read the balancing doctrine as set forth in the Barenblatt case, a single sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.639" offset="6741974">“Where First Amendment rights are asserted to bar governmental interrogation, the resolution of the issue always involves a balancing by the courts of the competing private and public interests at stake in the particular circumstances shown”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.149" offset="6803937">Now, this presents two very difficult and serious problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.909" offset="6823058">The first might be called a substantive problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.359" offset="6836851">What do we weigh?</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.484" offset="6845315">How do we ascribe?</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.680" offset="6850121">How much weight is to be placed to the various elements that we've put in this balance?</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.841" offset="6878751">The second might be described as a procedural problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.610" offset="6897768">How do we as practicing lawyers trying one of these cases go about the task of convincing the court at the trial level?</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.205" offset="6948237">How this balance is to be struck?</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.478" offset="6961298">Do we present evidence to the court on this matter?</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.489" offset="6973315">Do we say to the court the balance should be struck one way or another on the basis of certain facts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.988" offset="6999333">I would assume from the language of the court that the question of whether X weighs more than Y is a question of fact, and like all other questions of fact is to be tried by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.833" offset="7062653">Taking the procedural matter first, we attempted to meet this at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.242" offset="7084387">And after I assure you a great deal of deliberation, we came to the conclusion that we would try to convince the court that in the particular circumstances in this case, whatever may have been true in Barenblatt and those preceding cases, the balance fell all the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.198" offset="7172159">And we call an expert witness, Professor Thomas Emerson of Yale University, the record contains his qualifications on the subject and we asked him a series of questions which went to the problem of how much weight do we give to the various elements in this scale?</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.431" offset="7245093">How many investigations has the Committee had into subversive activities?</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.881" offset="7258885">How many has it had into infiltration in the steel industry?</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.376" offset="7296920">How much of this evidence was known to the Committee?</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.172" offset="7312071">What is the extent of the Communist menace in the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.550" offset="7325550">How important is the Communist Party as a threat to the security of the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.709" offset="7342164">What kind of laws do we already have on our books with respect to this matter, all of this being directed to the question of where the balance lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.973" offset="7387303">Now, the Government says that his testimony which of course was presented as expert testimony was contrary to a lot of decisions of this Court, ACA against Douds, the Dennis case, Subversive Activities Control Board case, Carlson against Landon and to the findings of Congress and the Subversive Activities Control Act for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.022" offset="7479463">And it's true of course that Professor Emerson's testimony was contrary to it but what of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.390" offset="7508929">I would think that in a criminal trial if a defendant wants to prove -- that today is Friday, he has a right to come in and try to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.617" offset="7541844">That may be hard to prove but he has a right to try.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.336" offset="7556681">The court rejected the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.674" offset="7566085">The District Court as I recall gave no reason for rejecting the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.488" offset="7585311">The Court of Appeals, however, said that the testimony is rejected because the question of balancing is a matter of law and not a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.749" offset="7630346">And I must confess that at that point I have some difficulty in following the reasoning because assuming that the determination of which outweighs what is a matter for the court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.755" offset="7690428">How was the court going to tell, what are the facts on the basis of which this question of law is going to be determined?</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.013" offset="7715401">Does the court reach its conclusions with respect to the importance of the steel industry with respect to the importance of the Communist Party with respect to all of these other things, by reading the newspapers or by reading acts of Congress, or by listening to the television?</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.069" offset="7775692">I should assume normally that one of the ways in which a court makes up his mind how to decide even a question of law is by the presentation of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.488" offset="7821354">We think we had a right to introduce that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.977" offset="7831280">We think it was highly relevant on the question of balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.265" offset="7848417">Now, I would like to get to the first problem which I have characterized as the substantive problem and it is here that I have the greatest difficulty and if what I say sounds --</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.339" offset="8004733">There was no countervailing testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.836" offset="8014764">That is, the Government made no effort to meet the testimony but its here for the court to examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.463" offset="8045275">I should like to discuss the problem of what gets in this balance and if I sound in this discussion more like a metaphysician than a lawyer, all I can say is that it wasn't my idea of this balancing theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.950" offset="8111208">The Solicitor General says -- or let me put it this way, there are two sides to this balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.819" offset="8138689">There's the side for affirmance and there's the side for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.331" offset="8156662">The side for affirmance which is the Solicitor General's side, says that the public interest that is involved in this situation and I quote from page 48 of the brief is, the need for information concerning putative subversive activities in a critical area of our national life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.793" offset="8246523">Now, remember in discussing this, I am not discussing admissibility of testimony or pertency -- pertinency of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.531" offset="8277452">I am addressing myself to the question of how much weight shall be given to it in this constitutional balance?</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.609" offset="8301798">How important is it to outweigh the very weighty considerations which everybody concedes at least in the language, everybody concedes lie on the other side of the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.592" offset="8349759">How much importance is it that the Government have this -- the answers to these questions?As I said before, this was the tenth inquiry into the question of Communist infiltration into basic industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.304" offset="8424573">Thousands -- literally, thousands of pages of testimony had been taken on this subject before the Gary hearing and hundreds of witnesses had been called.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.112" offset="8459786">It is conceded by counsel that much of the testimony sought of Mr. Yellin was corroborated of information that was already in its files.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.756" offset="8510360">As a matter of fact says the Government, it had most of this information, its far back as 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.443" offset="8541184">Look at the debates when the Taft-Hartley law, Section 9 (h) was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.883" offset="8566888">And I might refer also to Mr. Justice Jackson's opinion in ACA against Douds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.337" offset="8600743">Now, the Government responds to all of this by saying that the -- it isn't for the court to decide whether Congress needs more information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.393" offset="8676916">It isn't for the court to decide whether Congress wants corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.353" offset="8692799">And I would say that would be true if we were talking about questions of admissibility because I suppose counsel in a case have the right to get evidence which corroborates information in its files if he wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.221" offset="8744208">But it is for the court to decide how much weight is to be given in the balance, otherwise, how can we possibly apply the test in the Barenblatt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.851" offset="8790810">How many times are we to listen to a repetition of the same testimony sometimes from the same witnesses repeating over and over and over again the same the facts with respect to alleged Communist infiltration in the steel industry or in other basic industry before we get to the point where we say this weighs as only a grain of sand in the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.254" offset="8912436">It's not admissibility, it's not pertinency but weight in the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.353" offset="8932812">Is there not a time when this must end and we will say that the constitutional rights of the witness will overcome?</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.331" offset="8976697">Mr. Tavenner in his testimony in this case said at one point and I quote, its in the footnote of page 19 of my brief, he said, “We received a considerable amount of evidence at Flint, Michigan or perhaps eight or 10 instances of colonization of the exact type that you describe”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.701" offset="9094144">How long do we continue to deprive persons of the way he writes which everybody admits that they have in order to get this additional bit, this additional one man who will testify to something after thousands of pages of testimony have taken and hundreds of witnesses have testified on this subject?</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.631" offset="9201873">That's on the one side of the scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.579" offset="9209710">What have we got on the other side?</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.570" offset="9217651">The first place we have the petitioner's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.149" offset="9235937">The right to engage in public debate on critical issues, a right which the court has on frequent occasions held there's tremendous importance and the right which the activities of this Committee inhibits for reasons that are set forth fully in the Watkins and Sweezy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.625" offset="9313886">But, there is another right, a right which a very great Justice of this Court felt was perhaps the most important right of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.359" offset="9364773">Mr. Justice Brandeis said, the makers of our Constitution recognized the significance of man's spiritual nature of his feelings and of his intellect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.356" offset="9400822">They knew that only a part of the plain pleasure and satisfactions of life are to be found in material things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.147" offset="9427989">They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.953" offset="9455156">And they conferred as against the Government the right to be let alone, the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.016" offset="9515447">This is the right which lies or one of the rights which lies on one side of the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.005" offset="9559437">But there is another element in this balance on petitioner's side which I think is even weightier and that is the right of the public to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.211" offset="9620250">In De Jonge, this Court said the security -- the security of the Republic, the very foundation of constitutional government lies in full opportunity for free political discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.154" offset="9671973">Edward Yellin is the petitioner in this case but ranged along with him as co-petitioners unknowing, sometimes perhaps even unwillingly, there is a host of other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.604" offset="9745742">There is the Committee for Sane Nuclear Policy which was investigated by the Committee and was almost destroyed, if not completely destroyed, by the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.853" offset="9794748">Next week in this city, there will be hearings at which some 20 witnesses of Women Strike for Peace will be called before this Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.738" offset="9846366">Last week, an organization called Medical Aid for Cuba, two weeks ago perhaps, was the subject of an investigation by this Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.099" offset="9895790">The World Fellowship camp was the subject of an investigation not by this Committee but by a little Committee of little -- Un-American Activities Committee up in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.516" offset="9945422">The Integration Movement, almost every progressive movement in the United States has at one time or another been subject to the investigation by this Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.924" offset="10015117">To my mind, this is the weightiest element of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.176" offset="10036120">Now, the Government responds by saying Mr. Yellin wasn't trying to debate, he wanted to keep quiet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.268" offset="10068407">He had an opportunity to express his views freely at this Committee and they would've given him plenty of opportunity to do so perhaps and perhaps they would have, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.135" offset="10111875">But certainly the right to engage in free political discussion involves the right to choose your own forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.091" offset="10143744">No one who was present at the Gary hearing could possibly have confused that hearing room with the free marketplace of ideas which is supposed to be the guarantee provided by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.015" offset="10199437">Mr. Yellin, if he wanted to express his views, had a right to express his views in the circumstances and in conditions that he chose, not in conditions in which he was appearing as a witness before a Committee in a courtroom crowded with hostile persons, with the opportunity for an exchange of ideas which the Constitution is supposed to guarantee was not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.540" offset="10317511">Now, I'm aware as I speak that really in talking about this balance, I am attempting to weigh the imponderable, to measure the limitless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.872" offset="10362859">In a sense, that's perhaps the principal reason why I feel that the Barenblatt balancing test is improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.143" offset="10399953">It cannot be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.503" offset="10409357">It would turn the law into a scholastic's debate rather than a living technique or a living method for ruling man and in this case, for protecting the fundamental freedoms without which, we have no democracy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.700" offset="10490128">And there are other reasons which have been called to the attention of the court why the balancing theory is not consistent with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.150" offset="10535999">As Mr. Justice Black has so frequently pointed out, the language of the Constitution is absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.329" offset="10564733">Furthermore, the doctrine is based on the fullest premise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2662.696" offset="10754173">I submit that furthermore the Barenblatt decision, Braden, and Wilkinson decisions provide -- proceed on a false premise namely that our national security can be injured by too much free speech, by too much political organization, by too much free association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.627" offset="10837870">I don't know of any society, certainly no well-established society whose security was ever threatened by too much free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.958" offset="10875173">It may be true of a country that is just emerging from colonialism where for a period of time, limitations on free speech are necessary, but we're a strong country, probably the strongest in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.682" offset="10930134">Our political institutions are stable and the greatest threat to that stability is I suggest an interference with the freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.632" offset="10989902">I would like to return now to the point raised by Mr. Justice Stewart at the very beginning namely the remarks at page 26 of the Government's brief, namely the delicate and dangerous of the -- the most delicate and dangerous of a courts' responsibilities with which justifies a constant review of the constitutional issues that are involved in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.985" offset="11119261">The Solicitor General suggests that this -- the issue raised by this controversy relates somehow to the balance of -- to the balance of powers between the Court and Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.611" offset="11185821">And that the real issue in this case, the most important problem in this case is the manner in which the Congress, an equal and coordinate branch of Government, has performed one of its own constitutional functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.436" offset="11253112">And it goes on to refer to the dangers of collision between this Court and the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.624" offset="11273906">Now, I admit that that is a dangerous and a difficult controversy and a delicate one also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.263" offset="11304417">And I don't think that it is in this case too in a very great extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.024" offset="11331480">I should have thought that the fundamental problem with respect to the extent to which this Court may interfere with if I may use that word or review the actions of Congress had been set on the Marbury against Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.887" offset="11386964">And while I know the question keeps recurring every once and a while, I really think it's a pretty unimportant part of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.078" offset="11419669">There is, however, a delicate and a dangerous issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.524" offset="11445478">And that relates not to the relationship between this Court and Congress but rather to the much more important, much more critical relationship between the citizen and this Government, the extent to which the Government may interfere with the freedom of speech and the freedom of association of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.517" offset="11549445">This is the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.755" offset="11558431">This is the issue which has been -- which has come before this Court scores of time, particularly in the last 17 years, I guess it is since the Cold War began.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.307" offset="11612557">And although I don't want to discourage any of the members of the court, my guess is, it's going to continue to come before this Court because it is a difficult and a dangerous and a delicate problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.447" offset="11661145">It's the issue which I think begun in ACA against Douds and then to the Dennis case, and the Yates case, and the Ballin and the Lerner case, and the Uphaus, and Watkins, and Sweezy and Barenblatt and all of these other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.053" offset="11719555">It had to be faced in those cases and I think it has to be faced again and it will continue to come before this Court as long as there is a court because the problems which arise out of the efforts of a Government to interfere with the freedom of its citizens are never ending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.001" offset="11799385">The effect of the decisions of this Court are well-known.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.610" offset="11821850">It has resulted in -- well, one of the members of this Court has referred to in two articles written I believe 10 or 12 years apart as the Black Silence of Fear or more recently the Submerged American.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.151" offset="11887992">I think this Committee has played a tremendous role in creating that Black Silence of Fear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.555" offset="11917563">And while it is not the only one of our Government agencies which has resulted in submerging the American and cutting off so much of the vital debate which is necessary if our country is to survive as a free country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.175" offset="11972106">It has played its role in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.038" offset="11991542">I hope that the Court will take this opportunity to reconsider the decisions that I have referred to and to free our people and our democracy from at least one of those repressive forces which has interfered for I guess about 25 years now with the free and full expression of opinion by Americans and their free association.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.546" offset="12141589">I would like first to deal with petitioner's only non-constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.745" offset="12166353">One that he was not obliged to answer the Committee's questions because the Committee violated its own rules, its act of questioning witnesses in executive sessions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.683" offset="12222151">The Committee has a rule which apparently dates back to 1953 set forth on page 82 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.910" offset="12254960">If a majority of the Committee or subcommittee duly appointed as provided by rules of the House of Representatives, believes that the interrogation of a witness in a public hearing might endanger national security or unjustly injure his reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.645" offset="12317968">The Committee shall interrogate such witness in an executive session for the purpose of determining the necessity or advisability of conducting such interrogation thereafter in a public hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.110" offset="12371780">Pursuant to this rule, the subcommittee met and considered whether there was sufficient reason to believe that questioning petitioner in a public session might endanger the national security or unjustly injure his or another's reputation so that the petitioner should first be preliminarily questioned in an executive session.</text>

            <text syncTime="3567.319" offset="14372655">Coming to the constitutional issues, I must make two preliminary remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.087" offset="14407764">First, we are concerned here with the refusal of a particular witness to answer four specific questions during the course of a particular congressional investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.551" offset="14461576">I stress the point because petitioner's reply brief complains of our close and literal attention to the facts of this case and says that the real issue is what the petitioner's calls the enormity of the Committee's offense against the American people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.021" offset="14531480">This Court, I need hardly say sits to decide particular cases and we're here concerned with the case of Edward Yellin, a case which as I shall argue later is very different and in our view much stronger for the Government than any of the previous cases that have come before the court and other conceivable cases involving the Committee's activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.152" offset="14623953">The rights of other witnesses not to answer other questions under other circumstances and on other occasion will have to be decided when those questions arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.569" offset="14677661">Second, I must emphasize that we are not concerned here with the rightness or wrongness, the wisdom or folly, the necessity or superfluity or even the fairness or unfairness of the Committee's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.313" offset="14736593">The responsibility for legislating is vested in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.055" offset="14755610">With it goes the power and duty of deciding what bills should be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.036" offset="14775568">What information should be obtained and how it should be obtained in order to frame appropriate legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.192" offset="14804093">When an individual asserts that the Congress has trespassed on one of his individual rights, then of course, this Court has the constitutional duty of deciding between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.303" offset="14848606">The court can avoid unseemly conflict and avoid upsetting the balance of our constitutional system only by exercising special care in such cases in marking the line between violation of constitutional rights which the courts must redress and simply bad judgment in the exercise of legislative power which is remediable only in Congress or at the polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.234" offset="14964276">The previous decisions of this Court coming down directly to the constitutional merit, the previous decisions of this Court require affirmance of the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3757.083" offset="15131669">This -- and appropriate indeed and essential when the inherited law has lost reality or changes in the condition and the community has altered the conditions on which the precedence were based.</text>

            <text syncTime="4075.159" offset="16404041">Of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.008" offset="16415431">Coming to the substantive question, in our view, reason and principle also demonstrate quite apart from the authority that the use of compulsory process in examining petitioner as a witness before the Congressional Committee deprived him of none of his constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.359" offset="16504769">In examining this question, we may begin with the proposition that it said along that Congress' power to use compulsory process to secure information in aid of a proper legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.470" offset="16561298">It is also clear beyond dispute on this record that the questions that petitioner was directed to answer were asked in pursuance of a proper legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.448" offset="16609155">The Committee's purpose was set forth in the resolution authorizing the hearings in Gary and it was restated by the chairman at the start of the hearing in the presence of all the witnesses including the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.154" offset="16667982">Without reading his statement at length, it emphasized that the Committee was holding the hearing for the purpose of receiving testimony concerning Communist techniques and tactics of infiltration, and the extent, character, and objective of Communist Party activity in basic industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.478" offset="16741334">He then went on to refer to the existing laws over the administration of which the Committee was exercising oversight and to some of the bills and kinds of bills that were before the Committee at the time the hearing was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.774" offset="16810506">Among those proposals just to make it specific that there was legislation to which this inquiry was highly relevant, were Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Hartley Act which had been repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.615" offset="16861811">HR 8151 which proposed to amend the Internal Security Act by setting -- by authorizing the Secretary of Defense to establish a system of security around defense plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.998" offset="16919385">Another bill introduced by Congressman Shearer, who was one of the Committee conducting the hearing to accomplish the same purpose by other ways and various proposals to amend the Smith Act, the Internal Security Act, and the Communist Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.197" offset="16988139">Whatever might be the merits of any particular piece of legislation, it is also -- it is not denied in this case at least that Congress has some power to enact some legislation, to deal with infiltration of vital defense plants, in basic industries by professional revolutionaries through fraud and deception for the purposes of a foreign dominated conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.876" offset="17090853">And that is the kind of conduct that the record shows very clearly into which this inquiry was being conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.337" offset="17120737">It's also plain that the pertinency of the questions was made clear to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.126" offset="17143829">He acknowledged that he was present when the chairman made his statement and as I understand it, he has not challenged the pertinency seriously in the lower court or in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.965" offset="17191267">It follows therefore that the use of compulsory process was a lawful exercise of legislative power unless it violated some constitutional privilege or other restriction upon the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.345" offset="17244766">Petitioner's claim is that the answer violate -- is that the use of that process violated the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.315" offset="17276635">We think otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.319" offset="17288652">In the beginning, it is plain that petitioner is not being prosecuted because of any statements, any publications, or any associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.934" offset="17335150">He is being prosecuted because of a refusal while under subpoena to answer the inquiries of the legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.935" offset="17367124">The use of compulsory process is concerned primarily with the witness' performance of the normal duties of all citizens to furnish information needed in the legislative or judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.199" offset="17420204">Second, the use of the compulsory process did not in itself curtail petitioner's freedom of expression or association.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.167" offset="17464090">He remains free from any governmental compulsion to think, speak, or form such associations as he chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.403" offset="17500975">Nor was this petitioner being tolerated by the Committee because of any past statements or association.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.418" offset="17529083">Being so far as the record shows, he has never made any past public statements of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.585" offset="17549667">He was subpoenaed because he apparently could give information needed in the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.725" offset="17574222">He does not even claim that this is a case of exposure for the sake of exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.917" offset="17595016">In this case, we submit, in this respect we submit, the case is markedly different from Uphaus, Wilkinson, and Braden where the dissenting justices did find occasion, that did find that the occasion for calling the witnesses was their public criticism of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.461" offset="17665233">There is nothing like that present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.968" offset="17679235">Fourth, the Committee's questions I think can fairly be described as primarily concerned with conduct with reported infiltration of professional revolutionaries into the basic steel industry concealing their background and identity through fraud and deceit all in support of a program looking forward to disruption of normal trade union activities, political strikes, or sabotage, or espionage as might be directed by a foreign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.995" offset="17803368">Undoubtedly, the questions would also have elicited information concerning petitioner's associations and beliefs or possibly including his speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.107" offset="17839835">But this is because the speech and associations were an extra complaint intertwined with the conspiracy to engage in conducts subversive of bona fide unions and dangerous to the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.296" offset="17896573">In short, the petitioner's only complaint here when one analyzes it carefully is that the consequences of compelling him to testify about conduct might result in disclosure of views and associations sufficiently unorthodox, unpopular, or even hateful to the general public to damage him and perhaps to discourage others from embracing unorthodox or controversial views or associations in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.851" offset="18018826">Let me make it clear that I do not suggest that those consequences raise no constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.340" offset="18048711">Of course they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.940" offset="18055084">In some cases they lead to the conclusion that the use of compulsory process would violate the First or the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.065" offset="18087581">My only point is that in this case, any interference with freedom of association as an indirect consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.820" offset="18122689">The constitutionality of which cannot be decided without taking into account the justification for requiring the disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.885" offset="18158947">Let me take a moment to try and make that clear, both the distinction of its importance by a simple and indeed perhaps trivial example what I think it illustrates the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.865" offset="18202833">Suppose that a man is on trial for first degree murder and he offers an alibi to the effect that at the time the murder was committed he was at a closed meeting of the top members of the John Birch Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.480" offset="18257272">The defendant subpoenas me as a witness hoping to prove through me that he was at that meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.037" offset="18295515">Now, if I am compelled to answer on the ground overruling my claim of freedom of speech or freedom of association, certainly the disclosure of the secret membership in the John Birch Society would be damaging to my career.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.180" offset="18360090">I assume that I would lose the pleasure of appearing before this Court as often as I do, I doubt that I should be welcomed back by my former associates with much enthusiasm.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.642" offset="18405961">Others who observe my faith, I suppose might be deterred from engaging in the same associations at least under the same circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.056" offset="18443577">Nevertheless, it seems fair to conclude that no one did -- would dispute that the testimony could be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.449" offset="18477119">That the interest in the fair administration of justice would prevail over my interest in privacy of associations and that it would add nothing to the argument to say it would be true that the public interest in my associational secrecy so that others might be -- might feel free from engaging in associations would also be sacrificed to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.130" offset="18575862">Now, of course I don't say that the present case is identical with the example.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.520" offset="18597491">My point to repeat it is that the effect on First Amendment freedoms in the present case is indirect and consequential as in my example.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.771" offset="18642422">And that therefore, one cannot dispose of the present case simply by asking whether freedom of association might be adversely affected by requiring the testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="4722.527" offset="18993507">The critical element is the existence of and the weight to be ascribed to the interest of the Congress in compelling disclosures from an unwilling witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.236" offset="19036348">Here, the public interest in questioning petitioner lay in obtaining for legislative purposes information concerning putative subversive activities in a vital area of our national life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.552" offset="19097579">The information if the reports the Committee had withdrew was relevant to national survival.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.602" offset="19125791">The Communist Party, Congress had previously found, also purportedly a political party is in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.837" offset="19170722">The policies and programs of the Communist Party are secretly proscribed for it by foreign leaders of the World Communist Movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.836" offset="19202696">Even if that finding were not supportive by convincing proof, certainly there would be the strongest reasons for inquiring further into the conduct of a conspiracy which there was substantial reason or indeed any reason to believe might be being manipulated by a foreign and sometimes hostile power for treasonable purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.122" offset="19295901">Nor are we concerned here and I wish to emphasize this distinction between some of the prior case, nor are we concerned here with a general inquiry into the activities of the Communist Party, the Committee was investigating a reported program for infiltrating highly educated rev -- professional revolutionaries into the basic steel industry by concealment, fraud and deceit.</text>

            <text syncTime="4916.052" offset="19767568">Petitioner was in a position to furnish extraordinarily accurate and pertinent information about this reported conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.393" offset="19812916">He was not subpoenaed as the result of indiscriminate dragnet procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.976" offset="19835277">The Committee had information before he was called that he was a long time Communist Party member who had actively participated in the party's organization of the steel industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.691" offset="19882088">In the Gary area, he was apparently one of the professional revolutionaries with higher education whom the party had recruited to conceal their past, pose as laborers and thus gained for Communist purposes key positions upon the workers in basic industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.397" offset="19960978">His education and this long experience put him in a position where if he were willing, he could give invaluable information upon the direction, techniques, and purposes of the program of colonization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.514" offset="20025448">Now, it is said that although the Committee was asking questions directed to that very program of action, that the Committee had all the information it could possibly use on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.232" offset="20088351">And that this would be redundant and therefore of no value to the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.838" offset="20110712">We think Mr. Justice Douglas that there are two complete and very short answers to that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.897" offset="20143000">In the first place, it seems to us to have no foundation in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.098" offset="20163793">We can't tell what petitioner would've said since he refused to even to tell where he lived in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.389" offset="20192946">But every indication in the records shows that he could've contributed in part for the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.240" offset="20216351">Now first, at the time petitioner was called, there was no witness who had testified about Communist infiltration in the steel industry in Gary, Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.618" offset="20269850">Its nonsense I think to say that testimony about what happened in Buffalo or some place in the fish industry down in North Carolina or in the auto industry in Flint covered this subject completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.351" offset="20324812">Certainly, a conscientious legislature would wish to know the extent of the colonization programs in terms of the number of vital industrial plants effect, it wish to know its intensity in terms of the number of professional revolutionaries are on that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.406" offset="20393044">And he'd wish to know about the degree of its success or failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.173" offset="20412061">If the evidence convinced him that the conspiracy was ineffective and made up on the whole of rather pathetic or radically inclined young men, he might conclude that the wisest fallacy would be to leave them alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.309" offset="20476635">If the evidence showed that numerous vital steel mills were affected and that there were professional revolutionaries in key union positions of each, new legislative measures might be deemed appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="5570.763" offset="22386395">I would like to add that they didn't have any testimony about activities in Gary either then or later after 1950 or 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.580" offset="22433729">This was a hearing in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.332" offset="22444701">Looking to -- or early 1958, looking to legislation to be enacted at that by some early Congress of manifestly knowing whether these efforts had continued or not, or whether they had been intensified or not at Gary would be highly important to one who is trying intelligently to make up his mind on this precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.721" offset="22534248">Third, as Your Honors suggested, the witness, there was every reason to believe could have given information on this point in a great deal, more detail than any of the previous witnesses who had testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5627.673" offset="22614079">There has been -- I understand that no colonizers, they were called, no professional revolutionaries who infiltrated by this process of fraud and deceit who has been willing to testify before the Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="5743.398" offset="23076968">Now, there is one other answer to this argument about new information that I would like to submit to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.610" offset="23105808">It's more fundamental so it doesn't need to be ruled upon in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5756.721" offset="23130258">We submit that whether information sought by a Congressional Committee is necessary or unnecessary or fruitless or useful or helpful or redundant is not a subject for a judicial determination once it is determined to be impertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5777.185" offset="23212074">There's no doubt that the objective of the Committee must be legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.259" offset="23232449">The information sought, as I just said, must be pertinent to that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.388" offset="23256900">There must I assume for present purposes be some reason to believe that the witness has the pertinent information and he must be made aware of its pertinence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.570" offset="23297651">The public importance of Congress' acquiring pertinent information on the subject under investigation must also justify the risk of damage to the individual liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5814.123" offset="23359822">But once those points have been covered, I submit, the judicial function is exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.412" offset="23385004">Choosing among pertinent lines of inquiry deciding when the ground has been adequately covered, decide -- relying on testimony received or seeking new testimony that will corroborate or disprove the testimony already received are all parts of the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5839.542" offset="23461491">No one can tell how helpful a logically material bit of information will be without studying and drawing inferences from the information you already have and ascertaining the other potential sources of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5854.137" offset="23519901">Obviously, the line that an investigation takes next requires some judgment as to what are the most likely forms of legislation and how will the Congress and the public respond from the legislative process to the information already adduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.816" offset="23590640">That I submit although as I say, I don't think our case rests on it, is a test for the law made and that the court should not undertake and substitute its judgment of theirs once the basic constitutional requirements that I had listed have been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5889.258" offset="23660440">Now, I would like to turn to the information to the interest asserted by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.953" offset="23691160">And I suggest that we should examine it very carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="5902.807" offset="23714565">Let me make it plain that when I talk of this as an individual interest, that we fully recognize that there is a public interest in individual liberties not only because of the importance of the individual himself, but that is what the Government exist for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5919.306" offset="23780603">But also because of the effect of the example on others and because the exercise of First Amendment freedoms and other civil liberties is of course important to the community as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.905" offset="23835042">Exactly stated, the in -- only interest that can be asserted by this petitioner is secrecy of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="5942.411" offset="23872972">Indeed, it's fair to say that everything indicates that the -- his claim is really to a right of deception concerning his association.</text>
            <text syncTime="5951.529" offset="23909439">Petitioner was not subpoenaed as I said earlier because of having a public or private utterance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.959" offset="23935248">He was not subpoenaed because of any participation in an open assemblage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5964.229" offset="23960325">The information in the possession of the Committee indicated that petitioner was recruited by the Communist Party to conceal his true beliefs and associations and then by false representations to insinuate himself in a bona fide worker organizations, and then to subvert them to his revolutionary purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.704" offset="24050186">The interest he asserts is in not having those activities known to the public so that he and others may feel free to engage in them in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.669" offset="24089997">I submit therefore, it is inaccurate to say that petitioner is simply invoking a right of freedom of speech or freedom of public assembly or association.</text>
            <text syncTime="6007.773" offset="24134510">At best, his claim is to a right of privacy in associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6014.221" offset="24160214">That right has received and in my judgment should receive constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="6022.177" offset="24192084">The point was decided in NAACP against Alabama, Bates and Little Rock, Shelton and Tucker and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6030.680" offset="24226043">There are two reasons however for concluding that the right to secrecy of association is not entitled to the same very high degree of protection which is acknowledge for freedom -- recognized for freedom of speech are open in public assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6050.991" offset="24307336">One reason for a deference in the degree of constitutional protection is that the reasons for the special protection we incurred, the freedom of speech do not pertain to the right of privacy of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.243" offset="24372328">The other is that the asserted freedom to conceal one's association may be used to subvert the freedom of association of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="6078.537" offset="24417468">Let me develop each point if I may very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6083.605" offset="24437844">First, we place a unique constitutional value upon freedom of speech because the public discussion is the only part -- that is not only the best half of the truth, but the indispensable condition of a democratic government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6099.828" offset="24502732">The best corrective for error in thought and speech is more thought and more discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.222" offset="24528227">We pitched our constitutional philosophy upon the belief that men who have the chance to hear all sides will reach the wisest and best decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6115.716" offset="24566262">No one ever stated the point more eloquently than Mr. Justice Brandeis in his separate opinion in Whitney against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.608" offset="24605759">I would like to take time to read a lengthy passage which states the ideas I've tried to condense, time forbids but I would like to emphasize that he winds that passage up saying, “If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech not enforced silence”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.804" offset="24718608">Now, petitioner is unwilling to stake his doctrine on such intents of being unwilling to suppress -- to subject them to the free competition of ideas, to the marketplace of ideas, to have them discussed, known they didn't -- have them known and publicly discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="6173.535" offset="24797497">He's not in a position to claim the same degree of individual freedom as those who are asserting the right to speak openly and publicly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.646" offset="24845981">Second, I would point out that secrecy or privacy of association is susceptible of abuses not open to speech or open public assemblage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6196.641" offset="24889971">It can be used not only to protect one's own freedom of association but to destroy or subvert or mislead the associations of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="6208.508" offset="24937409">There's no better example than the activities of the Communist colonizers described in the present record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6215.793" offset="24966562">According to the testimony before the Committee, these highly educated young men embraced Communism, joined the party, took part in its activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6226.183" offset="25008149">This counsel says is a normal -- is an exercise of the normal freedom of belief, of speech and association.</text>
            <text syncTime="6234.650" offset="25042004">But then by fraud and deceit, they were to gain jobs for workers, infiltrate the worker's organizations pretending to be bona fide trade unionists but in fact acting for a foreign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6248.765" offset="25098428">In this way, the asserted cloak of privacy would become a method of deceiving others in order to subvert or destroy their associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6259.293" offset="25140537">Now finally, I must emphasize the point made from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="6264.638" offset="25161958">The Committee was not investigating speech, thoughts, or political associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.050" offset="25187558">It was investigating conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.696" offset="25198111">The violation of any privacy of beliefs or association would be incidental to that same central inquiry, the result indeed of the misuse of speech and association to further a conspiratorial end.</text>
            <text syncTime="6291.076" offset="25267702">Judging the claims of petitioner's right and giving it its due public importance against the importance of the end being -- against the importance of the inquiry, the importance of full knowledge upon this very important subject of infiltration of our most basic industry, it seems clear to us that the judgment below was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6317.882" offset="25374908">Now, I've thus far not dealt with two of the arguments that were presented by Mr. Rabinowitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="6326.896" offset="25410957">One is the claim that the statute he says is unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="6334.454" offset="25441155">I must say first that it seems to me that any question about the vagueness of the rule -- of rule -- of the rule constituting the Un-American Activities Committee was clearly disposed of in (Inaudible) -- in Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6350.837" offset="25506670">As I read on page 122 after a long discussion, the opinion of the court says, “The rule cannot be said to be constitutionally infirmed on the score of vagueness”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.174" offset="25564035">And then it goes on to discuss whether Congress could constitutionally confer this authority on the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6371.811" offset="25590575">Now, it doesn't seem to me to change the argument to say that we are looking at this through the rule of dealing with -- in behalf of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6380.419" offset="25625057">Second, dealing with the argument on its merits, the petitioner had no reason to doubt what it was that he was required to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6391.952" offset="25671137">He was directed to answer those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6395.373" offset="25684825">And he knew that if he failed to answer the question, he in all probability would be charged of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="6403.186" offset="25716067">This is not like a situation that one can argue that he doesn't know what his legal obligation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6409.014" offset="25739473">His legal obligation was specifically pointed out to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.917" offset="25755042">The argument here is that well, we challenged the authority of the Committee to require that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6420.750" offset="25786389">Maybe it did require it or attempted to require it but it didn't have the legal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6426.013" offset="25807391">It's now settled that it did had the legal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6428.597" offset="25817736">Indeed that is conceded by petitioner and I would've supposed it was perfectly claimed that whatever be the exact limits of the Committee's authority, that there was no doubt about its authority to conduct this kind of investigation into this kind of activity and this by industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6446.885" offset="25890879">The other argument deals with the failure to receive Professor Emerson's testimony in answer to a general question what are the factual considerations and values that we should take into account in resolving the basic constitutional issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6465.608" offset="25965798">It's enough to say that the difference between the petitioners and ourselves is not whether Professor Emerson's views should be taken into account, but how should that kind of material be brought to the attention of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6483.497" offset="26037373">Should it be done by testimony under oath or should it be done in the normal manner by briefs or by the citation of such statements in law review article by the court's own study and understanding, by reference to public documents, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="6501.638" offset="26109889">Its enough to say that this kind of question dealing with the basic conditions, the basic human values, if you will, and conditions in society that enter into the determination of a constitutional question have always in our constitutional system, have been decided by the courts, and the basis of such knowledge or -- and information as it may come to them in briefs or through their own reading and prior experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="6532.633" offset="26233919">And that it is not something to be found on the testimony in a particular record with the findings of fact by the particular trial judge on that record and not taking into account anything else binding upon this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6548.688" offset="26298075">Certainly, Professor Emerson's view should be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="6552.466" offset="26313226">They're in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6553.970" offset="26319287">I hope the Court will read them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6556.043" offset="26327542">They're an excellent illustration in my view of how easily and intelligent man could miss the whole point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6562.146" offset="26351992">But all such arguments are important for the court to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="6567.314" offset="26372577">But they needn't come in through sworn testimony and cross-examination, so that we submit Mr. Chief Justice that there was no error below and that the judgment should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="6700.091" offset="26903698">Now, to decide whether to recognize such a privilege requires a judge to have a view about Government, about the importance of freedom of expression on the part of Government officials and of course, a view about the knowledge of the kind of harm that such statements may do to the one who is defamed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6723.708" offset="26998157">But that kind of understanding about the impact in the community has never in the law I think been decided by calling witnesses to testify on the particular record.</text>

            <text syncTime="7428.128" offset="29815933">I trust I need not remind the court that we are dealing here with the application of a criminal statute and the right I take it that every person accused of a criminal statute has to present whatever facts there are in its favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="7443.285" offset="29876537">And to have the determination made on the basis of the record that's presented in the court and not determine on whether this Court or any other court who has read newspapers or what newspaper they have read.</text>
            <text syncTime="7458.985" offset="29939336">It doesn't seem to me that any intelligent system of justice can be operated on that basis and we never have up to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="7468.606" offset="29977788">I am somewhat entranced by the suggestions, somewhat belatedly made that the Government is now prepared to stipulate Professor Emerson's testimony, because this Professor Emerson's testimony is admitted as I understand the situation, this judgment of conviction should be set aside as contrary to the weight of the evidence since there's no evidence at all on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="7498.390" offset="30096906">No one -- nobody put any evidence here about the extent of Communism in the United States, about how vital or not vital the steel industry was, or any of these other facts, and I would take it that where there is some evidence on one side and no evidence on the other, the court would have to rule on the basis of that record.</text>
            <text syncTime="7524.822" offset="30202650">Of course this was not the position of the court below and I am sure of the -- and not the position of the Government below and I am sure that had the matter been -- had the evidence been admitted, there would've been cross-examination and I should think that there would have been not only cross-examination but perhaps rebuttal testimony because Professor Emerson's testimony, it seems to me, goes directly to this whole process of balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7556.708" offset="30330232">And while it may not have been as effective as calling a hundred thousand or a hundred and eighty million witnesses and asking them whether they're members of the Communist Party, somewhat impractical, it seems to me the kind of occasion which opinion testimony is appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="8010.569" offset="32145638">And I'm not going to read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8012.886" offset="32154937">It runs on some -- well, its too closely printed pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="8019.248" offset="32180328">I'll just read a few words.</text>
            <text syncTime="8021.186" offset="32188165">“Describing the tactical maneuvers of the Communist Party in its infiltration of labor unions, Mr. Lautner asserted that colonizers were sent to Gary, Indiana for the purpose of building a party in the steel industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="8034.144" offset="32239992">He defined a colonized Communist as” -- and then he goes on to describe one.</text>
            <text syncTime="8038.663" offset="32258069">“The witness told the Committee of classes conducted by J. Peters, a national functionary for the Communist Party for colonizing members of the Communist Party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="8047.293" offset="32292551">And he goes on at very considerable length discussing the whole colonization program of the Communist Party in Gary and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="8054.362" offset="32320867">Mr. Lautner testified immediately before Mr. Yellin.</text>
            <text syncTime="8057.706" offset="32334242">The Committee goes on to discuss the testimony of Mr. LaFleur who also testified as to the colonization in the Communist Party and it ends up with this conclusion reached without the benefit of Mr. Yellin's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="8070.731" offset="32386278">“The testimony disclosed the pattern of colonization in the steel industry by young men with excellent training and education who came into the area from New York City and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="8079.983" offset="32423267">It is apparent that a hard core of Communist Party -- of the Communist Party is actively engaged in the rehabilitation of a Communist Party in the steel industry in Gary”.</text>
            <text syncTime="8088.312" offset="32456600">So I submit the question two and four were just as cumulative as the others and weigh just as little in the balance, if we are to balance.</text>
