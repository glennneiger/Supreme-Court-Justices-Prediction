            <text syncTime="1029.031" offset="4219486">It is my desire very briefly to state the position of the State of Utah in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.576" offset="4245713">Utah was impleaded as the party defendant by order of the Court but only in its capacity as a Lower Basin State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.609" offset="4281762">Utah's principal interest in the Colorado is, of course, as a member of the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.917" offset="4307048">The portion of the Lower Colorado River Basin located within Utah lies in the extreme southwest corner of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.556" offset="4361592">In its north-south dimension, it is about 35 miles.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.286" offset="4408508">Where the Virgin River comes through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.664" offset="4414046">The principal streams are the Virgin River System, Kanab Creek and Johnson Creek and they enter into the Colorado below Lee Ferry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.894" offset="4462947">Of these three streams, the only one which contributes any appreciable quantity of water to the Colorado River is the Virgin River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.188" offset="4504116">By its pleadings in this case, Utah asked for a decree awarding it the right to the consumptive use of 125,000 acre-feet of water per annum from these tributaries of the Colorado River flowing through the Utah portion of the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.329" offset="4580707">This included approximately 50 -- 58,000 acre-feet of water for present uses and approximately $67,000 -- 67,000 acre-feet for future development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.709" offset="4638177">The future development consisted principally of an irrigation project known as the “Dixie Project” on the Virgin River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.423" offset="4677047">As the hearings before the Master progressed in this case, it became evident that no other State of the Lower Basin challenged any -- in anyway Utah's present uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.804" offset="4726575">Only California expressed any objection to Utah's proposed development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.700" offset="4754160">On the -- and the California objection in that respect wasn't made only as a part of its general contention that because of the inadequate water supply in the mainstream, no new project should be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.316" offset="4812675">In this date of the record, the Special Master held that no justiciable controversy was presented so far as Utah's present or future uses were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.151" offset="4863979">In fact, the Master's ruling applied not only to Utah but he declined to adjudicate any main stream rights to inflow from the tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.629" offset="4909850">Likewise, he declined to adjudicate any rights as between the tributary states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.286" offset="4936495">He did say, the Special Master, that in the event that the dispute arose that such dispute should be settled by application of the doctor -- doctrine of equitable apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.120" offset="4995845">Although Utah naturally would have preferred a decree from this Court affirming to it the rights it claimed as to present uses and future uses, we did not take any exceptions to the Special Master's Report and recommended decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.309" offset="5084557">This, for the very practical reason, that so far as the report and recommended decree were concerned, it left us free to continue our present uses and to pursue our future development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.717" offset="5142235">Presently irrigated acreage in the Utah portion of the Lower Basin is about 25,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.734" offset="5170343">The Dixie Project, the plans for which have already been implemented by state action, will increase this amount of irrigated acreage by about 13,500 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.787" offset="5234500">If the Court please, Utah is not directly concerned in how the Court may choose to divide the waters of the mainstream of the Colorado as between the States of the Lower Basin located on the mainstream, particularly, a division based upon a construction of the Project Act as distinguished from the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.313" offset="5328645">It is our considered judgment that the Lower Basin rights of Utah are left unimpaired by the Special Master's Report and recommend decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.433" offset="5821106">The issues are in recommendations of the Special Master that our primary concerns in New Mexico have not been discussed by the other parties to this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.871" offset="5882859">As defined in the Colorado River Compact, New Mexico is both a part of the Upper Basin and Lower Basin.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.012" offset="6003440">Upon motion of the defendant, the State of California and the cause of our tributary interest in the Lower Basin, this Court ordered us to be made a party to the action and the order of December the 12th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.577" offset="6073657">As the hearings progressed, it became increasingly more evident that our interest in the principal controversy was more academic than real.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.301" offset="6116603">However, in view of our important, though by comparison de minimis, uses of water from the two aforementioned tributaries, New Mexico had a great expense prepared and submitted to the Special Master, evidence of these uses both present and contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.376" offset="6204897">Since there had not heretofore been an apportionment of the waters of the two streams between the States concerned, we precede on the premises of -- of equitable apportionment as previously enunciated by this Court in the case of Nebraska versus Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, to sustain our burden and because of certain rulings of the Special Master as to evidentially matter to be received was necessary to take the deposition of something over 200 witnesses comprising a deposition of some 3,700 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.551" offset="6381589">And this deposition was for the purpose of proving or providing direct evidence of present uses of water for irrigation in New Mexico, largely from the Utah River.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.450" offset="8857161">As Mr. Justice Harlan observed that yesterday in a question or a comment relate, California does have two strings to its bow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.043" offset="8899584">One is a so-called “limitation issue”, that is our contention that the claims marshaled against us on the main river should not be 3,100,000 acre-feet but should be only of the order 1,100,000 because 2,000,000 of the 3,100,000 from which we are excluded are accounted for by the advantages, the beneficial use which our neighbors make on the tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.358" offset="9008776">The second string of our bow is that if there is less than 7,500,000 acre-feet available for consumptive use in Lake Mead and below then the burden of shortages should be adjusted by application of the rules of equitable apportionment and should not fall pro rata upon this contract users irrespective of any of the elements of equitable apportionment, namely, priority of their inception of their use nor the magnitude of their existing users.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.781" offset="9130506">I shall deal first today with that second problem, namely, assuming, for the moment, that there is a shortage that is that the Secretary of Interior cannot deliver from Lake Mead and below as much as 7,500,000 acre-feet of consumptive use in any year, how shall that shortage be borne?</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.634" offset="9201873">With respect to that string of our -- on our bow, we have two errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.576" offset="9225697">One is that the statute did not either set up a -- an apportionment, an allocation among these States nor authorize the Secretary of Interior to do so but if he did do so then he did not impose a federal apportionment a proration scheme upon us but he preserve the doctrine of priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.988" offset="9323290">I shall take up first the question of what the statute did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.066" offset="9343666">If any authority is to be found in the Boulder Canyon Project anywhere for the imposition of a federal apportionment absent a -- I presume, an interstate compact, that authority must be found in Section 5, no other source is suggested by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.697" offset="9414196">This is a section which directs that the Secretary of Interior is authorized a contract with the storage and delivery of water and second that no person shall have the right to use of the water stored as aforesaid without a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.985" offset="9471352">Did or did not, that language delegate to the Secretary of the Interior, the authority to “impose a federal apportionment” those are the Master's words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.350" offset="9512730">Upon these three States absent the consent of their legislatures to a tri-state compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.994" offset="9543346">Now, as a preliminary matter, this Master is quite firm -- quite firm in rejecting Arizona's contention that the Section 5 language, which says that such contract shall confirm to Section 4 (a), means that the Secretary was given a mandatory formula by Section 4 (a) which he should impose by his contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.647" offset="9629968">The Master is unequivocal upon that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.184" offset="9640103">He says that the authority in Section 4 (a) to these States to enter into a compact is permissive only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.011" offset="9663404">It was never entered into and has no operative effect whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.312" offset="9680645">It did not control the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.254" offset="9692348">That means so if the Secretary did impose a contractual allocation scheme upon us, it was by the exercise of his own discretion at some later time and the Master says that he voluntarily looked to the apportionment which might have been made by an interstate compact had one been made in the pattern of Section 4 (a) and more or less adopted that scheme and, hence, imposed it upon us against our will a compact which our legislature had rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.541" offset="9813556">We find that to be an extra ordinary piece of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.093" offset="9835708">We looked to the language of the statute and we look to the temper, the time, the spirit, the language of the debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.312" offset="9860577">This was a Congress which was acutely sensitive to the necessity of proceeding by a consent of the States and not by a mandate of Congress attempting -- attempting to divide water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.372" offset="9908851">That is inherit in almost every section of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.467" offset="9921285">Have this been the simple problem above Congress laying its mighty hand upon the river and dividing up the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.467" offset="9945213">There was no occasion whatever for the Colorado River Compact in the first place, the cumbersome device of first, an authorization by Congress in 1921 to the States to negotiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.537" offset="9989517">They send in of a federal commission to preside and then bringing back that Compact for a consent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.500" offset="10013341">Second, there was no necessity had they to offer to the legislature of California a limitation agreement to be made effective by the legislature of that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.055" offset="10051584">All Congress had to do was to make the division on the phase of the statute and that's all it was to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.264" offset="10076453">Why go through to this cumbersome device of the -- of the consensual arrangement?</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.511" offset="10093380">And third had Congress indented to divide up the waters among Arizona, California and Nevada, why not say so and do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.146" offset="10123995">Why again go through the cumbersome device of inviting these three States to agree in either in the pattern here offered or in some other pattern in the latter event bring it back for the approval of Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.096" offset="10171747">Why throughout these Acts set up the -- the enthronement, as the Senate Committee called it, of a compact clause of the constitution, use that device to bring about agreement rather than impose it by a federal mandate, for the very good reason, for the very good reason that all of the Senators who address themselves to this subject denied the existence of the constitutional power in Congress to affect any such division of the waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.775" offset="10270490">They control the sovereignty, the jurisdiction and the, let us say, ownership of the waters vested in the States and not in the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.416" offset="10301001">Whether they were right or whether they were wrong in their constitutional analysis is beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.144" offset="10323989">There was a complete absence of intent by Congress to make any such division.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.937" offset="10347081">And of course, a fortiori, a complete absence of any attention to delegate to the Secretary of the Interior an authority which the Congress itself denied that it possessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.965" offset="10395251">Let me read to you a few examples of what the Senator said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.592" offset="10425762">But first may I call the Court's attention to a compilation of -- on this subject of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.992" offset="10451362">You have it before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.542" offset="10457527">It is captioned, legislative history appendixes accompanying the reply brief of the California defendants to the answering briefs of the United States, Arizona, Nevada is dated October 2, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.870" offset="10502875">This contains a collection of the -- what was said by the proponents and the opponents of the -- of the bill upon five related topics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.768" offset="10546448">Appendix A, beginning at page 7, is a collection of extraction, the debates evidence in Congress view the Congress had no power to allocate the waters of the Colorado River System.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.273" offset="10596498">Appendix B, beginning at page 31, is a collection of the extracts from the debates showing that both the proponents and the supporters of the Swing-Johnson bills clearly and consistently denied that the bills purported to make or to authorize any federal allocation of water among the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.791" offset="10674552">In Appendix C, beginning at page 79, says the legislative history items selected by Arizona do not relate to any Federal allocation within the Lower Basin but rather to substantial effectuation of the Colorado River Compacts apportionment to the Upper Basin without Arizona's ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.820" offset="10758666">Appendix D, beginning at page 103, makes the point that the legislative history refused Arizona's contention that the proponents and opponents of the Swing-Johnson bills believe the Project Act would abrogate interstate priority principles within the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.230" offset="10828257">And Appendix E, beginning at page 134, makes the point that the legislative history of the Section 5 requirement that water delivery contracts executed pursuant thereto shall conform to Section 4 (a) refutes Arizona's argument that Congress, unilaterally, imposed a federal allocation of Colorado River waters upon Arizona, California and Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.629" offset="10921880">The specific items that I would like to call the Court's attention to are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.974" offset="10963257">Let me start with a Senator who was disinterested not for any of these States, Senator Borah.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.792" offset="10990529">This -- the extract I am about to refer to is in page 75 of the legislative history compilation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.748" offset="11026369">And the particular statement appears at 70 Congressional Record 391-92.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.849" offset="11050820">He says, "I can see how Arizona might loose her rights not by reason of this legislation but by reason of Acts of appropriation and going on, and going in carrying out the terms this bill in case Arizona did not assert her rights in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.609" offset="11105782">If she stood by and water were appropriated to beneficial use in other States, she might loose her rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.133" offset="11127933">She would not loose it, however, by reason of this legislation but by reason of the Acts of appropriation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.951" offset="11155205">And he goes on to say “Undoubtedly,” referring to page 92, “Undoubtedly, if Arizona stands idly by and does not protect her rights either by appropriation or by such action in the Courts as will protect them, she will loose her rights ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.788" offset="11226572">That is one of the penalties of living under the doctrine of prior appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.508" offset="11241409">If an individual has a farm or a ranch and the water is running by it, he does not use his neighbor below him or above him can appropriated and taken away from him ultimately.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.142" offset="11271920">So, here, I presume, if Arizona should not act, she perhaps would be prejudiced by this legislation in the sense of the Acts carrying out would result in appropriation by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.350" offset="11304730">It would not be act to Congress which took away her rights however but the acts of appropriation following as a result of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.953" offset="11331166">Senator Pittman, Congressman White, Congressman Bankhead others all made statements to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.311" offset="11364603">Senator Bratton said -- he -- his expressions are the same effect, I shall not take your time to review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.953" offset="11451225">All of this, Your Honors, points up the points of appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.824" offset="11470660">It seems to us that Section 5 when it use the expression “That no person should have a right to the use of waters stored aforesaid without a contract” was talking about the incremental supply not therefore appropriated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.912" offset="11570970">The Court may recall that in the last time the Court wrote an opinion on the Colorado River case in the 298 U.S. 558, the Court denied to file on the ground of United States was unnecessary party to Arizona's suit brought against the States of the Colorado River Basin for what it has been called a judicial apportionment of the unappropriated waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.558" offset="11685595">Now, there, the Court to Mr. Justice Stone said this, I -- what -- the point and want to emphasize is that the Court construed the Boulder Canyon Project Act as dealing in its authority delegated to the Secretary where the unappropriated waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.554" offset="11773576">The unappropriate waters, what is the fond of water?</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.994" offset="11791339">The water stored as aforesaid to which the contractual power shall relate, and the Court said this, at page 565, “It is conceited both by the bill of complaints and the returns that all the States in the Colorado River Basin except California and California so far as material to the present case apply the doctrine of appropriation to the waters of flowing streams in their respective territories.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.599" offset="11893739">Under this doctrine, diversion and application of water to a beneficial use constitute an appropriation and entitle the appropriator to a continuing right to use the water to the extent of the appropriation but not beyond that reasonably required and actually used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.282" offset="11956537">The appropriator first in time is prior and right over others upon the same -- same stream and the right, when perfected by use, is deemed effective from the time that purpose to make the appropriation is definitely formed and actual work upon the project has began or from the times statutory requirements of notice of the proposed appropriation or complied with provided the work is carried to completion and the water supplied to have beneficial use with reasonable diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.876" offset="12074924">At page 567, this Court said, “A judiciable controversy is presented only if Arizona, as a sovereign state, order citizens, whom she represents, have present rights in the unappropriated water of the river or if the privilege to appropriate the water is capable in division and when partitioned maybe judicially protected from appropriation by others pending it -- its exercise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.463" offset="12177220">Now, the question is when Congress delegated to the Secretary the authority to make contracts and directed that no one should have the right to use the water stored as aforesaid saved by a contract, did it mean as the Master oblige that it cut off, took over all of the -- all of the waters not there before in fact put to use by 1929 and cut off all appropriative rights to the extent they had not been in fact put to use by the use of water, took that appropriation away and that the Secretary may now contract out that appropriated but it's -- as yet unused water to others or did the Court -- did the Congress says we believe, especially in the light I have just read from 298 U.S., mean that it was not cutting off appropriative rights but was dealing with the unappropriated water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.372" offset="12432906">The distinction is this, the Master construes a present perfected right as being a right measured by the quantity of water in fact put to use by June 25, 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.520" offset="12485465">There were, as of June 25, 1929 as everywhere on every western stream, appropriative rights perfectly valid, vested, existing property rights to the -- to quantities in excess of those in fact used as of that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.497" offset="12557354">Let me illustrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.561" offset="12565608">When you build a great project, it may take years to put all the water to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.565" offset="12593612">A municipality that doesn't build ahead 25 years ahead of its requirements is delinquent in its duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.447" offset="12625168">A federal reclamation project automatically under the reclamation law allows a ten year period of development in which the farmers pay nothing toward repayment of the cost of the project because everyone recognizes it takes time to get farm started.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.101" offset="12687757">You can't begin to grow crops and pay up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.119" offset="12699878">The history of the west is if the water used gradually increases on every project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.175" offset="12716074">You don't put it to use the day after you complete your -- your dam and your canals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.522" offset="12733419">That is a very reason for the requirement of diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.085" offset="12747734">It is a reason for the law of relation back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.374" offset="12764871">Did or did not Congress, in Section 5, intend, without saying so, to abrogate a doctrine of relation back and to recognize and protect then the valid appropriative rights only to the extent that the water had been applied to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.113" offset="12827773">That would be a remarkable conclusion to read into this statute written by western Senators acutely conscious of the -- of the fact that water rights depended in all of their States on the law of appropriation and it -- either on state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.505" offset="12897364">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.455" offset="12905200">The word “present” is derived in -- in the statute from the use of the word “present” in Article VIII of the Colorado River Compact which provides that this present perfected rights are unimpaired by this Compact and in the Second Section provides that when a storage has been provided on the main river to the extent of 5,000,000 acre-feet, those present perfected rights shall attach to that stored water in effect releasing up stream flow for use by junior appropriators in the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.016" offset="13035395">So far as the matter of statutory interpretation is concerned in Section 6 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, all that Section 6 did, written by Upper Basin representatives, Mr. Carpenter of Colorado, as he explained was to designate that this reservoir, Boulder Dam -- Hoover Dam is the reservoir referred to in Article VIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.016" offset="13119404">That when this reservoir has built, a present perfected rights in the Lower Basin attached to that reservoir and or not to remain operative against the Upper Basin pending the completion of a dam say Glen Canyon in the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.246" offset="13172381">Why they use the word “present perfected rights” is not apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.684" offset="13194115">It is not apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.228" offset="13200280">It has -- as used in the Boulder Canyon Project Act, surely, not the -- the implication that we are restricting the recognition of appropriative rights to the quantities in fact used as of June 25, 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.732" offset="13262346">There are two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.178" offset="13268093">One, the Master gives is why that can't be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.208" offset="13284185">He treats as a present perfected right as of June 25, 1929, the full requirements of Indian Reservations created prior to that date even though they hadn't use or drop the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.729" offset="13330265">To him, present perfected right as to a federally created reservation doesn't mean the water put to use as of June 25, 1929, it's the ultimate requirement of the irrigable acreage of the reservation even though he may not discover that until a land of -- utilization surveys made 20 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.229" offset="13408319">Second, a more controlling from our view point, is the fact that this Act offered to California a limitation applicable to her rights which may now exist, rights which may now exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.335" offset="13476760">Article III of the Compact provides that the 7,500,000 acre-feet apportioned to the Lower Basin shall include the water necessary to supply “rights which may now exist”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.224" offset="13524302">That is a different definition and a greater right than a more restricted “present perfected right”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.369" offset="13560874">Did Congress, did Congress in offering to California a -- an agreement which would limit the quantity of water available for our “rights which may now exist” intend without saying so to redefine and limit that expression down to the quantity in fact used in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.987" offset="13639346">In short, when we get onto the discussion of what is a present perfected right, we are on a subdivision of the true problem which is what is a right which may now exist as of 1929, a right which may now exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.677" offset="13702040">If I may have your attention to Section 4 (a) at page -- on top of page 382, start at the bottom of page 381, if you please which is a direction of the Act shall not take effect until conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.061" offset="13827636">But this is a pro -- language of the prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.154" offset="13839966">This Act shall not take effect, no authority be exercise so forth and so on then as return the page and no water rights shall be claimed or initiated here under and no steps shall be taken by the United States or by others to initiate or perfect any claims to the use of water pertinent to such structures unless meant held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.491" offset="13917288">These conditions as to the enactment -- limitation are met and ratification of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.814" offset="13942680">But two thirds the way down the page appears the language of the limitation which California is to enact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.195" offset="13964204">The quantity stated is to include all uses under contracts made under the provisions of this Act and all water necessary for the supply of any rights which may now exist, any rights which may now exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.753" offset="14030346">Consequently, we say, Your Honors, that our rights which may now exist as of June 25, 1929 were preserved, not cut off as of the magnitude of the quantity of water there before put to use and that those rights are entitled to retain their interstate priorities as against Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.196" offset="14116133">We think that the language of this Court in the first of the Colorado River cases, 283 U.S., is precisely to that point because there, the Courts speaking through Mr. Justice Brandeis relied upon Section 18 of the Act to accomplish precisely that result in reassuring Arizona that her appropriative rights were not cut off by the statute as against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.517" offset="14213413">Section 18, appears 395 of the report, and this provides that nothing herein shall be construed as interfering with such rights as the States now have either to the waters within their borders or to adopt such policies and enact such laws as they may deem necessary with respect to the appropriation control and use of waters within their borders except as modified by the Colorado River Compact or other interstate agreement of the United States gives out or Arizona that gives that language inter-basin affect only as to practically Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.100" offset="14351757">The Master gives it intrastate effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.965" offset="14363251">He relies upon it to preserve the priorities intrastate within Arizona, let us say, as between contract holders and appropriators under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.454" offset="14409226">We say that Mr. Justice Brandeis speaking for this Court gave an interstate effect because the claim of the State of Arizona was that the Project Act had in effect cut off its right of control of appropriation and for that reason was unconstitutional for variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.787" offset="14486549">The Court rejected that claim relying upon Section 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.474" offset="14529285">Now, the -- to pursue this line of thought for a moment, the distinction between what the definition of what our water stored as aforesaid which the contracts of a right shall relate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.514" offset="14573380">This question came up early for administrative determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.230" offset="14588322">And in 1930, the Secretary of the Interior advised the Palo Verde Irrigation District which was then had a problem before of whether should or should not apply for a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.187" offset="14636074">It had used since 1877 the natural flow of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.974" offset="14655300">And on July 31, 1930, the Secretary of Interior wrote to the Palo Verde Irrigation District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.761" offset="14682467">This is California Exhibit 351 and he construed Section 5 of the Project Act as relating only to the incremental stored water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.363" offset="14728861">He said, “If no stored water is required by the Palo Verde Irrigation District, no contract between that District and the United States will be required.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.967" offset="14763238">Those possess their priority rights to the unregulated flow of the river will be privileged to continue the enjoinment of those rights without an interference by storage in the Boulder Canyon reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.507" offset="14801377">As a result, the Palo Verde contract and all of the contracts subsequently made in California provide for the delivery of so much water from storage as together with all other waters diverted, all of the waters diverted, equally stated quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.579" offset="14905657">We think that when the Master disowns and rejects the contention that Section 4 (a) imposed a mandatory proration formula, he thereby holds under opinion out the many contention that the Congress made any division of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.919" offset="14979009">And we do not find in Section 5 any delegation of authority to the Secretary of Interior to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.440" offset="15005132">What Section 5 does say is that the Secretary shall make contracts for the storage and delivery of water and those contracts shall be for permanent service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.045" offset="15047555">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.907" offset="15054973">The Master twice explains the phrase “permanent service”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.571" offset="15069706">It is required, he says, in order to give a project a reasonably stable and reliable source of water, legally and -- and physically available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.914" offset="15107009">That is precisely the policy, the purpose of the law of priority of appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.409" offset="15129057">So that he who has by his efforts to put water to use shall not be deprived of it at a later time by some administrative proration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.502" offset="15165419">The Secretary did in fact enter into a contracts before California agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.295" offset="15184541">There are not many contracts involved here to control these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.214" offset="15204185">There are contracts in existence with four California agencies, two with the State of Nevada, one with the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.452" offset="15245145">We do not find in Section 5 any authority to the Secretary to make any interstate allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.290" offset="15268551">These are to be, in our mind, contracts with such as those that had been made for years under the reclamation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.702" offset="15298226">Section 8 of the 1902 Reclamation Act provides that beneficial use shall be the basis of the measure and the limit of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.169" offset="15332080">United States doesn't issue patents or grants to water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.177" offset="15348067">The States don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.713" offset="15354232">The United States beginning in 1902 has followed the pattern established by the state law, which is that possession, beneficial use measures the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.643" offset="15397909">The State doesn't issue you a grant or patent to water rights anymore than does to wild flower or fish in the rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.075" offset="15423718">It gives you a license to appropriate them, to take possession of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.775" offset="15438451">The right is possessory in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.431" offset="15445138">You establish it by self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.204" offset="15452139">It is measured by what you do for yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.104" offset="15463737">There is no such thing in the doctrine of any States water law or until this moment, until this moment in the laws of United States which delegate to any administrative officer the power to set aside to reserve or as this Court said in 298 U.S. to somehow apportion, judicially apportion irrespective of use to set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.705" offset="15554226">That isn't the way of life for the West.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.215" offset="15568227">Water is not locked up in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.630" offset="15581915">It is made available for use to the extent its use, the right is acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.762" offset="15598425">Now, the Congress intend to generate some new kind, some new kind of a water right never there before heard of in the western water law, of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.908" offset="15634996">It was dealing against the -- the background, the pattern, the whole tapestry of the water law of the West and it took care not to tinker with it, not to tinker with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.211" offset="15676165">If Congress, if these Senators disclaim that the United States the power to divide up the water, if they insisted that the legislatures of the States do -- do so, it is inconceivable that they've delegated this great power to any Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.244" offset="15732381">Now, I turn to the second phase of this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.787" offset="15750562">If the Congress didn't divide the water and didn't delegate to the Secretary the power to divide it, the search ceases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.384" offset="15780864">No such creature as a contractual allocation scheme imposing a federal apportionment likely now a priority exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.260" offset="15824436">But if did delegate any such power to the Secretary, where is the piece of paper that made the apportionment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.997" offset="15859336">And if we can find that piece of paper, does it throw out the window the law of priority or does it preserve it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.760" offset="15894444">Let's embark briefly upon that search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.286" offset="15908551">Yesterday afternoon, the question was asked by Mr. Justice Black and by Mr. Justice Frankfurter about the power -- disposition of electric power to Hoover Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.860" offset="15946794">Now, that opens up a very interesting comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.979" offset="15963303">Section 5 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act in the one section provides for the disposition of power and the disposition of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.836" offset="16002696">With respect to power, with respect to power, it provides for contracts with States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.691" offset="16034147">With respect to water, it does not, it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.458" offset="16053164">With respect to power, the -- as Mr. Justice Frankfurter indicated, there weren't any preexisting rights to power, there were as to water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.517" offset="16085452">There wasn't any preexisting pattern as to how you allocate power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.045" offset="16103528">This was a new resource being freshly created.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.449" offset="16113142">There wasn't existing pattern of water law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.386" offset="16124949">What did the Secretary of the Interior do under the authority of Section 5?</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.481" offset="16141249">First, let's glance at the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.873" offset="16190882">It appears that at the bottom of page 384 of the -- of the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.904" offset="16218990">“The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized, under such general regulations as he may prescribe, to contract for the storage of water in said reservoir and for the delivery thereof at such points on the river and on said canal as may be agreed upon for irrigation and domestic uses.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.467" offset="16281266">I'll stop there in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.539" offset="16285550">That looks and sounds like a delivery to a water user and not to a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.149" offset="16315956">Next, “And generation of electrical energy and delivery at the switchboard to States, municipal corporations, political subdivisions and so on upon charges that will provide revenue adequate”, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.257" offset="16364440">Then it goes on with the language in which it will become familiar here, “Contracts respecting water for irrigation and domestic uses shall be for permanent service and shall conform to paragraph (a) of Section 4”, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.537" offset="16413550">Now, did any in Secretary of Interior construe this language as authorizing him to make an interstate apportionment of water?</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.126" offset="16459839">Did he construe this language as authorizing him to make an interstate apportionment of power?</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.682" offset="16478124">The answers are diametrically opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.869" offset="16486797">Here is what in fact happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.642" offset="16497977">The Secretary of the Interior in 1930 did sign general regulations for the -- governing the allocation of power to be generated at Boulder Dam not Hoover Dam.</text>

            <text syncTime="4487.600" offset="18053726">It pays for 35% of the cost of Hoover Dam, a dam from which it will be denied all water whatsoever if the Master's decree is approved and if the Colorado River Compact is ever enforced, which it will be, to restrict the water supply in the main river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4508.538" offset="18137527">As I mentioned earlier, the Metropolitan Water District's water rights by a federal contract as well as by the terms of the state priorities enforced in these contracts are junior to agricultural priorities in California to such an extent that if the Colorado River Compact has ever enforced against the Lower Basin, this great district that face 35% of the cost of the dam that makes all of the water here in dispute available, gets not one drop of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5120.461" offset="20585200">So that Secretary Icke, in 1944, had had the advantage of reading four decisions of this Court dealing with the Colorado River question and he surely could not find in any of those decisions, any determination aid that the -- the reference to the Colorado Red River Compact means something other than the Compact, the fond of water that I -- Secretary administering is different from that which statutes seems to talk about nor could he find in that statute any obligation of priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.889" offset="20710902">So that when the Arizona Water Contract was signed in 1944, it doesn't purport to be an interstate allocation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.276" offset="20748518">Secretary Ickes was just as careful as Secretary Wilbur to stay out of that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.484" offset="20773282">Let's look at the Arizona Water Contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.945" offset="20783104">Here, if anywhere, you find the piece of paper which is the interstate apportionment and what do we find?</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.748" offset="20806405">This begins at page 399.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.427" offset="20821034">The very first preliminary paragraph says this contract is made as such in such a date under the Act of Congress approved June 17, 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.266" offset="20856456">That's the reclamation law enacts amendatory thereof and so on including the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.900" offset="20886967">Now, the fundamental of the reclamation law is Section 8 which provides a beneficial use shall be the basis to measure the limit of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.775" offset="20922493">Did this contract attempt to setup anything other than beneficial use says the basis to measure the limit of the right?</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.259" offset="20948407">Did this put in deep freeze, so to speak, 2,800,000 acre-feet?</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.768" offset="20970454">Now, turn to page 400.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.356" offset="20976828">Here is Article VII (a), Delivery of Water, subject to be availability thereof for use in Arizona under the provisions of the Colorado River Compact in the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5228.179" offset="21016116">United States will deliver, top of Page 401, a maximum of 2,800,000 acre-feet up to a maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.383" offset="21044955">And how is he going to do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.369" offset="21060838">It is -- he's going to deliver to actual users.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.596" offset="21085706">Thereafter shall make contracts for the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.889" offset="21098977">It is simply a -- an expression of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.902" offset="21114964">The Government is quite explicit about this in saying that this about this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.997" offset="21143385">And this is from page 47 and 48 of the -- of the United States answering brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.755" offset="21170343">It is our understanding that this contract with Arizona does not, by itself, authorize the actual delivery of water in compliance with Section 5 of the Project Act since that Section requires that the contracts be entered into with the actual users of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.874" offset="21238888">We think so too.</text>
            <text syncTime="5286.053" offset="21247561">United States goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.333" offset="21252681">Rather, this contract is in nature of a commitment by the Secretary to enter into contracts with users in Arizona up to the limit of 2,800,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.024" offset="21291447">In this sense, it is an allocation by the Secretary, that amount of water for a future contractual use.</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.060" offset="21319659">We say there's no such authority in the Boulder Canyon Project Act of the Secretary of Interior to make any allotment for future contractual use.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.529" offset="21349439">He's authorized a contract with users.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.570" offset="21361664">And to deliver to them a specific name points on the river or on the canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.404" offset="21380995">Any contract by the Secretary of Interior that seems to take over the authority to make an interstate apportionment is ultra vires, ultra vires.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.322" offset="21428642">And Secretary Ickes didn't attempt to do it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.312" offset="21440658">Here's what he go on say.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.437" offset="21461138">He says at page 40 -- page 405, Article X.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.297" offset="21480573">“Neither Article VII”, Article VII is the one that provides for delivery of water, “neither Article VII nor any other provision of this contract shall impair the right of Arizona and other States and the users of water therein to maintain prosecutor defend any action respecting and result prejudice, too, any of the respective contentions of said States and water users as to: One, the intent, effect, meaning and interpretation of said Compact in the said Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.824" offset="21594676">Two, what part, if any, of the water used or contracted for by any of them falls within Article III (a) of the Colorado River Compact.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.011" offset="21627382">Now, let me pause there a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.805" offset="21634591">Is Ickes talking shorthand when he says our paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado River Compact?</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.845" offset="21658728">He was not a man inclined to use shorthand either.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.859" offset="21674820">Now, it passes all understanding that every Secretary of Interior for all of these decades was talking shorthand by paragraph (a) of Article III something other than the Compact said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.678" offset="21738036">Here, he goes on to say, “And furthermore, if the Master is right, this is wholly irrelevant question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.030" offset="21763532">What part falls within Article III of the Colorado River Compact?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.671" offset="21778056">That's nothing to do with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.484" offset="21785266">Ickes' goes on to say “Three, what part, if any, is within Article III (b) thereof?</text>
            <text syncTime="5425.454" offset="21805223">Four, what part if any has excess or surplus waters unapportioned by the said Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.327" offset="21824658">And five, here's my point, "What limitations on use, rights of use and relative priorities exist as to the waters of the Colorado River System provided however, by -- by these reservations?</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.253" offset="21880351">There's no intent to disturb the apportionment made of Article III (a) of the Colorado River Compact", same article “between the Upper Basin or the Lower Basin.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.918" offset="21919013">Now, how can you use reference to Article III of the Colorado River Compact in the disclaimer at the end as meaning of something other than the same Article when he refer to it as relating to their respective rights of these Lower Basins States, all in one sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.018" offset="21979408">But the significant thing is if the Secretary of Interior had made an interstate apportionment that wiped out relative priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.293" offset="22012531">Why in the world, in 1944, Secretary Ickes announcing that this contract that does not make any determination with respect to relative priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5485.545" offset="22045550">If the Master is right, it didn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.888" offset="22054954">And they ceased to exist by the Secretary signing of this very piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.075" offset="22071672">This is the piece of paper if any is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.274" offset="22080449">You can't find anything that even touches it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.518" offset="22089435">Because until 1944, until 1944, by no one's contention was there any interstate apportionment made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5504.180" offset="22120051">No contractual allocation scheme was completed or came into existence until Harold Ickes signed this piece of paper and this doesn't do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.397" offset="22164982">I have to turn back to page 403.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.478" offset="22185253">You'll find that in -- in paragraph -- paragraph (l), the last sentence, “Present perfected rights to the beneficial use of waters of the Colorado River System are unimpaired by this contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.983" offset="22247320">As of 1944 -- present, I suppose means 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.592" offset="22317746">Now, at the same time the Secretary Ickes signed that contract, he promulgated a decision dated February 9, 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.791" offset="22346585">He'd held hearings before he signed that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.436" offset="22361109">This appears the Special Master's Exhibit Number 4 at page A567.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.684" offset="22394128">This is a decision in which he explains what he's done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.078" offset="22423698">You won't find here the statement I have “forever allocated” or I have “determined priorities” or I have substituted proration with priorities, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5596.013" offset="22487437">He says, Article X, that's the one I read to you a moment ago that made these reservations, was purposely designed to prevent Arizona or any other State from contending that the proposed contract or any provision of the proposed contract resolves any issue on the amounts of water which are apportioned or unapportioned but the Compact, any amounts of apportion or unapportioned of water available to their respective States under the Compact and the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.026" offset="22603525">It expressly reserves for a future judicial determination any issue involving the intent, effect, meaning and interpretation of the Compact and Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.197" offset="22644172">The language of Article X is plain and unequivocal and adequately reserves all questions of interpretation of the Compact and the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.457" offset="22681161">Now, there is not the announcement by the Secretary Of the Interior that -- that I had made an interstate apportionment, I have forever allocated, I have substituted proration with priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.280" offset="22720449">Here is an announcement by the Secretary of the Interior that all questions as to relative priorities are reserved.</text>

            <text syncTime="5779.196" offset="23220120">But first, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the -- we -- we conceive the contracts made under Section 5 with the California users has been true Section 5 contracts to the type the United States talks about the contracts with -- with users for permanent service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.302" offset="23316564">We treat those and any Section 5 contract that conforms to the requirement and being a contract with the user as being in a sense, a -- an initiation of an appropriation stored water under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5817.488" offset="23373302">These contracts to us are licenses or permits to appropriate stored water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5822.781" offset="23394513">No one may have the use of stored water without a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5826.242" offset="23408306">But having a contract, he has the same thing as a license to hunt birds or a permit from the State to appropriate water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.532" offset="23437458">He doesn't have any grant or patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5836.567" offset="23449684">He may then put the water to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="5839.411" offset="23460968">And thereupon, Section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902 becomes controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.120" offset="23479881">That is a control over the effect of Section 5 contract's beneficial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.355" offset="23500779">These are basis of measuring the limit of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5851.833" offset="23510706">As the Court said in Ickes versus Fox, United States is a carrier of water under its contracts to the man who is establishing the right to -- right to that water by its user.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.139" offset="23551979">And under Section 8, in general, that water is appurtenant to land as a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5866.845" offset="23570787">The law of relation back applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.550" offset="23589595">To our mind, the contract with Arizona is not that at all, it doesn't purport to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.691" offset="23614151">If the United States puts its finger right on it, it is not a Section 5 contract at all, at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5884.566" offset="23641631">It is -- if given that effect as an apportionment, as a reservation and perpetuity for Arizona, it's ultra vires, secretary didn't have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.182" offset="23676113">The wrong, the Master's (Inaudible) is by his -- creating the Arizona contract of 1944 as only it were authorized by statute to be and it in fact was an apportionment in substitution for interstate compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.324" offset="23752704">There just isn't any such creature contemplated by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5915.775" offset="23766497">The Arizona contract re-visualize as nothing more than an announcement by the Secretary of the amount of to which he will contract with individual users in Arizona just as the California Limitation Act was a determination of the ceiling up to which he might contract with users in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5936.417" offset="23849044">He didn't call it limitation by agreement if you like.</text>
            <text syncTime="5939.602" offset="23861791">It's -- if the Limitation Act is not a grant of anything to California as the Master concludes, and I -- I think he's probably right about it, then the Arizona contract is no grant of anything that Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.588" offset="23913723">It's a statement of the conditions on which he will contract with individual users up to a ceiling that may or may not ever be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="5960.310" offset="23944652">And if this tri-state compact had been signed between Arizona or ratified between Arizona, California and Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.427" offset="23969102">That's where the Master says that the Secretary got these figures and I don't doubt he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.854" offset="23990836">But if that -- if that interstate compact had become effective, then, as to Arizona and Nevada, it, too, was a ceiling on appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5981.320" offset="24028662">Merciful heavens if the Colorado River Compact itself is just a ceiling on appropriations in the Master says and if the limitation on California is a limitation, not a grant, it's inconceivable that this tri-state compact, we were invited to sign, is somehow a limitation on California but a grant to Arizona and Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="5999.131" offset="24099924">They have same effect on all three of us, some sort of a reciprocal ceiling on appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.535" offset="24121553">Now, the Arizona contract certainly can't do anymore for Arizona than the ratification of that tri-state compact would've done.</text>

            <text syncTime="6331.942" offset="25431124">If one's in California and the other is in Arizona, but above Hoover Dam, priority controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.644" offset="25461948">We're invited to come back to this Court to sue anybody that depletes the flow of the river by a new diversion above Hoover Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="6346.907" offset="25490996">Priority will control even though the right we here assert is that solely of a contract user, a -- a contract holder has no preexisting right in -- under state law at all, priority preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6361.676" offset="25550033">Now, the very narrow question is did or did not Congress intend, having to recognize priority of appropriation and surviving everywhere except in this narrow little field of competitors on opposite sides of the river below Hoover Dam, didn't intend somehow, but I'm saying say so, that priority maybe abrogated by the Secretary of Interior if he feels like it, it's his discretion and then did any Secretary undertake to do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="6391.062" offset="25667584">The answer is no in both instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6393.828" offset="25678660">Why write into the statute Section 12 which defines reclamation law of Section 14 that says that this Act is a supplement to the reclamation law which shall control unless otherwise specifically provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="6404.868" offset="25722859">Unless they intended that Section 8 of the reclamation law be given effect, that beneficial use is the basis for the measurement of the limit of the right and why put in Section 18 after Senator King, it's author had ex -- expressed his vast discontent with the notion that the Federal Government somehow delay its mighty hands on the river dividing up the water except for reassurance that state priorities are to be preserved?</text>
            <text syncTime="6428.004" offset="25815437">And why did this Court say in 283 U.S. of Section 18 should have precisely that effect and therefore Arizona was not wounded by the passage of the Project Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="6529.849" offset="26222738">We say that the priority of the Palo Verde Irrigation District continues and is not struck down by the Project Act to the full 400,000 acre-feet if that water is put to use with reasonable diligence after 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="6543.542" offset="26277491">The period of reasonable diligence been affected by the magnitude of the project, the quantity of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="6559.779" offset="26342484">Second, with respect to a -- a water right that was initiated, let us say, after the passage of the Project Act in 1930 by the signature of a water storage and delivery contract by someone else, it happens that all of the California projects had initiated appropriations under state law prior to 1929, the most recent of them being the Metropolitan Water District which had filed this notice of appropriation, spent $2,000,000 in -- in truly gigantic preliminary work.</text>
            <text syncTime="6594.654" offset="26481977">But let's say that we had no such project with any -- any roots at all prior to 1929, this is project X, I don't what project that is going to exist, but let's preposterous say that here's a California project that nobody ever thought of before 1930 and it came into the Secretary of Interior and got a store -- water storage and delivery contract and it did went ahead and built that project and put the water to use and then now comes along a project in Arizona, which in some later date, 1933 let us say, came to the Secretary and got a contract and built this project, put that water to use and comes a time when there's a shortage on both these contract holders cannot be satisfied, what law shall govern in -- in distributing the shortage?The Master would say proration.</text>

            <text syncTime="7280.889" offset="29226924">If we take as a magnitude of present perfected rights, the quantity that could have been diverted by actual existing structures in existence in 1929, the figure would be 3,707,100.</text>

            <text syncTime="7313.580" offset="29357641">The figure of 3,707,100 is in the same document and it is finding 19 (d) 201.</text>

            <text syncTime="7342.575" offset="29473625">Now, we say, Mr. Justice Harlan, that first of all, when we speak of present perfected rights, we're on the wrong railroad track as measuring the -- the magnitude of the State generated prior -- pre-1929 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="7356.916" offset="29530990">They're bigger than present perfected rights by any definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7360.549" offset="29545618">They are rights which may now exist which include the right of relation back and that consequently the figure of 4,490,000 is the proper measure of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7370.800" offset="29586578">But if -- if the Master should be sustained that present perfected rights are measured by the quantity in fact put to use in 1929, then our figure becomes 3,275,000 thereabouts and Arizona is about 250,000 and Nevada is substantially zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="7389.788" offset="29662542">We're talking about an aggregate of about 3,500,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="7393.624" offset="29677902">Now, the Master would add to that in the category of present perfected rights, the ultimate requirements of Indian and other federal reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7401.190" offset="29708100">We don't agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7402.516" offset="29713429">But if you have those in, then you increase the Arizona figure to about 600,000 and you just my total of to about something less than 4,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="7412.677" offset="29754075">But if -- if present perfected rights are restricted in this manner, then the provisions of the report and of the decree, which provide for two years of attempted negotiation, failing that determination by this Court of a magnitude and priorities of present perfected rights, really results in a supplemental decree that is not likely to ever have a great deal of utility because nobody forecasts that the flow of this river is ever going to get down to 4,000,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="7447.123" offset="29891897">You're never going to reach a point where you are subsisting on present perfected rights only because the river is that low that no -- no there's no evidence to support that -- that notion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="7459.245" offset="29940381">The true significance of a determination of -- of present perfected rights, it seems to me is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="7466.052" offset="29967548">If the Master's formula is approached for correcting every other respect is wrong in this, that he has lumped together in his numerator and his denominator 44/75ths, 28/75ths, 3/75ths, this present perfected rights that didn't depend on storage at all, though should be subtracted.If you're dealing with an allocation of “water stored as aforesaid”, the incremental stored water then the power to allocate doesn't go further than the power to store.</text>
            <text syncTime="7497.152" offset="30091995">The Government had the right to interrupt and store the unappropriated water.</text>
            <text syncTime="7501.144" offset="30107982">Now, we said the inappropriate water is much narrower margin because valid appropriative rights should all be subtracted but if he subtracted only the present perfected rights then he's got the wrong equation because he's much in the position of saying I -- I agree that bonds have our priority ahead of stocks or the ventures.</text>
            <text syncTime="7523.007" offset="30195440">But in the event of insolvency of this corporation, I'm going to give you pro rata as your numerator of your fraction on your total holdings.</text>

            <text syncTime="7754.660" offset="31122056">Well, it had a -- a definitely defined source.</text>
            <text syncTime="7760.313" offset="31144626">It came into the statute on the demand of an Upper Basin representative, not in the Senate but in the House that he wanted to get in this statute some indication of the -- of the dam that was going to satisfy the function prescribed in Article VIII of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="7780.132" offset="31223933">Article VIII of the Compact says first present perfected rights are unimpaired by this Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="7785.013" offset="31243473">And second that when storage to the extent of 5,000,000 acre-feet has been provided, then present perfected rights are to attach to that storage and he wanted this dam named as that storage and he did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7796.815" offset="31290598">And he was very careful to say, this is Mr. Carpenter of -- of Colorado, he was very careful to say just prior this was being done, and that purpose was to, as I've indicated, to protect the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="7828.655" offset="31417971">And he made it very clear, indeed, that he wanted to designate this -- this dam as -- that to which the present perfected rights were apply to trigger Article VIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="7838.582" offset="31457677">“It had nothing to do”, he said with a determination of rights between Arizona and California.</text>
            <text syncTime="7843.194" offset="31476172">Indeed, Arizona and Nevada are both quite empathic here in saying that Section 6 of the Project Act has only inter-basin effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="7853.176" offset="31516087">And we don't think that the presence of Section 6 in the statute thereby demand of an Upper Basin representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="7861.012" offset="31547434">That's anything at all to do with limiting the doctrine of equitable apportionment in Lower Basin to the protection of present perfected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="7868.508" offset="31577422">And now, if you'll bear with me Your Honors, I'd like to return briefly to this other problem, the other string to our bow of -- of the -- the limitation question.</text>
            <text syncTime="7885.207" offset="31644191">You only reach this problem of priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="7890.353" offset="31664776">If you hold against us, if you hold against us upon our limitation issue, and let me just briefly answer some of the things that has been set here about that, the question is not, is not whether California shall get it's 4,400,000 acre-feet out of the stream below Lake Mead what I call the “Red River”, of course, it will.</text>
            <text syncTime="7914.342" offset="31760697">That's the only place it can now go unless they builds a new aqueduct to confine above Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="7920.337" offset="31784730">The question is may or may not the 3,100,000 acre-feet from which we're excluded be claimed against the Red River, Lake Mead and below or must it be asserted against the whole Lower Colorado River System including the tributaries?</text>
            <text syncTime="7936.742" offset="31850350">That is the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7938.806" offset="31858604">You don't reach your question of shortage unless you decide that question against us because the flow of the resource of the Lower Basin including the tributaries of 2,000,000 acre-feet and the -- the mainstream is adequate to sustain the 8,500,000 acre-feet to which the Lower Basin is restricted by the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="7959.312" offset="31940629">You run into the problem of shortages only if you honor the 3,100,000 acre-feet of claims that we can't have and which we perpetuated against the stretch from Lake Mead and down.</text>
            <text syncTime="7972.802" offset="31994546">Now, as to this, as to this, there is in the Master's Report this relationship between Section 5, on which I have devoted so much time today, and Section 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="7986.119" offset="32047835">Section 4 (a) authorize the Compact among Arizona, California and Nevada to which it had been ratified would have divided up the waters of the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="7996.645" offset="32089945">Now, the Master says that when the Secretary of Interior under Section 5 made water delivery contracts, he voluntarily, although not obliged to do so, looked to Section 4 (a) to the figures these States would have adopted in their Compact and they ratified it and picked those out and made them effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="8014.376" offset="32160893">Note this, Section 5, by its terms, operates only with respect to the Red River water stored and Lake Mead and below.</text>
            <text syncTime="8023.524" offset="32197465">Does Section 4 (a)?</text>
            <text syncTime="8025.460" offset="32205197">Of course, not, of course, not.</text>
            <text syncTime="8028.033" offset="32215542">Whether or not Section 4 (a) encompass the Gila, which was the subject of the -- of the legislative material offered yesterday by the Solicitor General, it is perfectly clear from the debates that Section 4 (a) as a minimum comprehended that main river from Lee Ferry down and not just from Lake Mead down.</text>
            <text syncTime="8047.630" offset="32293909">There's no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8049.946" offset="32303208">The Master relies upon Senator Pittman and Senator Hayden.</text>
            <text syncTime="8054.075" offset="32319718">But those Senators were not contending, that's the Compact opposed in Section 4 (a) was one that dealt with the stream from Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="8064.563" offset="32361618">They were identifying, they were misconstruing the Compact as dealing with the main river from Lee Ferry to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="8072.930" offset="32395055">Now, there's a vast difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="8075.602" offset="32405817">The inflow between Lee Ferry and Lake Mead is approximately equal to the Gila River inflow at the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="8085.874" offset="32446882">All the tributaries in the Lower Basin in the state of nature contributed about 3,000,000 acre-feet per year to the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="8092.480" offset="32473318">And though that the Gila contributed about one-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="8095.484" offset="32485334">So we are -- there is a disparity between Section 4 (a) arithmetic that resource was dealing with and then the resource dealt within Section 5 to the extent of 1,500,000 acre-feet per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="8107.813" offset="32534653">They can't mean the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="8110.760" offset="32546461">Now, if you, consequently, if you -- you cannot restore the rationale of the Master's argument by correcting his truncation of the river at Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="8124.173" offset="32600064">If you drew that river back together again, you do not restore, you do not give validity to his interpretation of Section 5 as taking into -- putting into effect the tri-state compact because it can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="8136.816" offset="32650637">We are dealing with entirely separate bodies of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="8176.833" offset="32810715">But he did not tell you, it's -- the salt content of this river as he call it is higher than the salt content of the Colorado flowing into Mexico which has occasion this current international crisis to which Mr. Justice Douglas referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="8195.440" offset="32885112">The Mexicans are complaining because the water reaching them in the main Colorado River has a salt content of three and a half tons per acre-foot and they can't irrigate with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8204.769" offset="32922415">This water that is leading the Imperial Valley has a salt content of four and a half to five tons per-acre foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="8210.543" offset="32945507">We can't irrigate with it anymore than the Mexicans can and this water is agricultural sewage.You see it the sewer flow and that's all there is to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="8221.335" offset="32988662">We would happy to have in this decree exactly the same provision before California as for Arizona that there shall be no waste of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="8236.160" offset="33048012">And let -- nobody be misled that there is vast amounts of water wasting to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="8242.244" offset="33072358">Now, Your Honors, in -- in the closing, I -- I would like to come to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="8246.219" offset="33088240">We are defending here California projects built at a cost in excess of $600,000,000 over the past 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="8254.316" offset="33120632">The youngest of them, 20 years old, serving 7 million people or more built and rely and it's upon an agreement with the United States, the statutory compact that our legislature accepted in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="8266.462" offset="33169220">The great principle at bay here at stake is whether a State may safely enter into an agreement with the Congress of the United States unambiguous on its States, unambiguous on its States.</text>
            <text syncTime="8278.134" offset="33215927">And they rely upon it, built our projects and then find that 30 years later that they are to be destroyed by an interpretation of the federal statute that no one has suggested in five previous trips to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8290.385" offset="33264933">Yesterday the -- someone objected to what do you call -- to my epithet describing this as a patentable novelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="8296.829" offset="33290637">That was the Special Master description of his severance of the limitation from the Compact, not ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="8303.147" offset="33315924">He said if these were a patent case, I would claim novelty upon this invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="8307.616" offset="33333791">Great projects are not to be destroyed by a patentable novelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="8311.252" offset="33348420">We are here defending a rule of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="8314.290" offset="33360541">The contracts made for permanent service, projects built in reliance upon them, upon the understanding of the law of the river, promulgated by the present and simultaneously in three enactments on June 25, 1929, brought back to this Court four times, back to Congress six times and never until the Special Master's Report came out in May of 1960, had anyone suggested that when we agreed to limit our rights in terms of the Colorado River Compact, this was “shorthand”.</text>
            <text syncTime="8342.769" offset="33474435">That simply is not basis of -- of confidence of reliance between the United States and the State in making this -- planning the project of this magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="8352.763" offset="33514454">We are not writing on a clean slate in 1929, not writing the lower view article how to interpret the Coloro -- the Colorado River Compact or the Boulder Canyon Project Act, we are here 30 years after the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="8365.048" offset="33563564">And here, Your Honors, we rest our case into confidence that we will have the protection of the application here of the law of this Court has applied in every other interstate water case that a law of equitable apportionment.</text>
