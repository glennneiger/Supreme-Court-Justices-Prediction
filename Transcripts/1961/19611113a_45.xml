            <label>Mr. Morris Wolf</label>
            <text syncTime="17.917" offset="175000">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.476" offset="185240">This case presents to the Supreme Court for the second time the dangers that are inherent in permitting the three great television networks to acquire and operate in a proprietary capacity, stations of their own at the same time that they supply programs to affiliated stations in something akin to in agency capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.630" offset="301850">In National Broadcasting Company against the United States from which the phrase ‘in a proprietary capacity' and ‘in something akin to an agency capacity' is quoted, this Court and its opinion by Justice Frankfurter upheld the FCC limitations on the location of radio stations which the networks might own, and quoted from the FCC report that the common ownership of network and station places the network in a position where its interest as the owner of certain stations may conflict with its interest as a network organization serving affiliated stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.412" offset="469034">This was similar to the condition which existed in the motion picture industry until this Court in United States against Paramount forbad producers of pictures to operate theaters.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.999" offset="523368">The first case that came up, which this danger had foreseen was U.S. against RCA where NBC wanted a station of its own in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.416" offset="581047">It threatened its affiliate Westinghouse, that if it didn't sell Westinghouse's Philadelphia station to NBC, NBC would cancel or refuse to renew Westinghouse's affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.763" offset="638412">You held, as we all know, that the antitrust aspect of NBC's action was not washed out by FCC's approval of the deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.140" offset="687940">The same thing has happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.590" offset="701733">This time, CBS is the actor, and it has used its leverage as a network, the phrase used by the Chief Justice in U.S. against RCA on a much smaller affiliate than Westinghouse, and with much more devastating anti-competitive results than in the Westinghouse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.720" offset="794206">The third instance of the same thing is involved in the pending suit which the Chronicle Publishing Company of San Francisco, another affiliate of NBC, has brought in the District Court for the Northern District of California against NBC for using similar tactics to compel that plaintiff to sell its television station in San Francisco to NBC.</text>

            <label>Mr. Morris Wolf</label>
            <text syncTime="202.820" offset="914683">I would like to -- I'm just going to give you the facts of the case if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.941" offset="935163">This is an appeal by Poller from the affirmance by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit of an order of Judge Holtzoff, granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment and dismissing Poller's complaint with courses.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.167" offset="1004022">Judge Washington dissented from the judgment of the Court of Appeals which was made by Chief Judge Wilbur K. Miller and Judge Prettyman, this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.110" offset="1047803">The action was brought under Section 4 of the Clayton Act for damages sustained by Poller as the assignee of the Midwest Broadcasting Company by reason of the violation by the defendants, Columbia and others of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.944" offset="1119169">The alleged conspiracy, the violation alleged was a conspiracy among the defendants to reduce competition and hence restrain trade in the television broadcasting industry in Milwaukee and to attempt to monopolize that trade as far as it concerns ultra frequency broadcasting in Milwaukee and throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.704" offset="1226167">The natural and intended result of the conspiracy as we claim was to force Poller to sell his television station to CBS at a distressed figure far below its real value, and this action is to recover the resulting damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.834" offset="1298683">The Court of Appeals in an opinion by Judge Miller, accepted as true, all the exculpatory testimony of the defendants in their pre-trial affidavits and deposition and on that basis found as facts that there was no conspiracy, no restraint of trade, no monopolization or attempt to monopolize.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.911" offset="1395022">“Hence,” he said, “Such injury as Poller sustained resulted from his own foolishness in investing so much money in his station when he had only an affiliation agreement with CBS which it cancelled in the exercise of its legal rights so to do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="341.779" offset="1470464">Judge Washington dissented on the ground that Poller raised genuine issues of material fact as to whether there was a conspiracy against him in restraint of trade and the monopoly, and that Poller should have a chance to have these questions of fact decided by a jury particularly where he said, as here, “It is charged that the public has been deprived of maximum television service by a reduction of competition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="371.078" offset="1587702">He pointed out that CBS's freedom to select its customers did not sanction what amounts to a conspiracy to restrain trade and the monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.182" offset="1636080">Of course, I realize that even if we win our battle in this Court, we have not won the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.350" offset="1660740">I do not at all underestimate the skill of our opponents, but we shall gain all that we have a right to ask, an opportunity to present our full case to a jury to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.082" offset="1711731">In order to reduce the questions of fact, which we claim and which Judge Washington thought were raised, we must recite the transactions which resulted in the injury to Poller.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.885" offset="1762931">In February 1953, Midwest Broadcasting Company, I think I -- it will be less confusing if I speak of that company as Poller because he became the assignee of all of its rights at the end of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.078" offset="1827715">Midwest Broadcasting Company which had been operating a radio station in Milwaukee was granted by FCC a permit for one of the three ultra-high frequency channels which FCC assigned to Milwaukee when FCC felt that it had opened a large number of new channels to ultra-high frequency broadcasting in order, as it said, to establish a truly nationwide and competitive television system because the previously 12 available very high frequency channels were so completely occupied that there was no room in them for further development.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.989" offset="2011303">From the commercial point of view, these VHF channels were preempted almost exclusively by the three great networks and their affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.704" offset="2054144">By 1954, CBS, NBC and ABC had affiliations with 90% of the operating stations in the United States, CBS itself with 202 of these stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.592" offset="2117778">These 202 stations served 90% of the population of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.871" offset="2150902">The development of ultra-high frequency broadcasting was difficult because no receiving sets then in the hands of the public could get UHF programs unless the owners attached converters which cost about $20 each, and it was a problem to get the set owners to make this investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.598" offset="2245778">Poller, however, when he got his permission, had faith in his ability to solve this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.377" offset="2280887">He built his station in Milwaukee with the call letters WCAN-TV and in September 1953, he entered into an affiliation agreement with CBS-TV which at that time had no primary affiliation in Milwaukee and was very eager to affiliate with Poller.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.820" offset="2378689">This was because, as the deposition show, CBS considered him a very promotion minded, sales minded, aggressive station operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.102" offset="2423829">As I am sure you know, an affiliation agreement is an arrangement with one of the three national networks under which the network agrees to furnish programs to a local broadcasting station in return for which the local station must show at specified hours, programs and advertisements which the network have agreed with national advertisers, shall be shown in their self-owned and affiliated stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.091" offset="2547754">The Poller agreement ran for two years.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.457" offset="2601148">It since has been abrogated as you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.990" offset="2615359">The power of agreement ran for two years but it gave CBS-TV the unilateral right to cancel it at anytime with six months notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.769" offset="2658408">CBS's high opinion of Poller's ability was justified for Poller had unexpectedly good results in getting thousands of TV owners in the Milwaukee area to convert so that they could see UHF programs, and CBS was highly complementary of its progress.</text>

            <text syncTime="737.867" offset="3054843">At the end of 1953, FCC in order to encourage the use of ultra-high frequency stations announced that it was considering a rule to allow any of its licensees to own two UHF stations in addition to the five VH stations which they previously had been permitted to own.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.582" offset="3157661">CBS at that time owned three extremely profitable VHF stations in the key cities of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, and had applications pending for the two more VHF stations which it was permitted to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.377" offset="3240835">As soon as the UHF matter became to be agitated, CBS began looking into the situation and decided that if it wanted to take advantage of the UHF channels, one of the two most desirable markets in the United States to do so was Milwaukee, which had more than 400,000 homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.265" offset="3340413">While CBS was making its investigation into the UHF situation, Congress also was looking into the situation, and Stanton, President of CBS told the Senate Committee in June 1954 that Poller's station was a vigorously and aggressively manning UHF station and was doing well in Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.671" offset="3442082">And Akerberg, Vice President of CBS-TV and one of the defendants had a meeting with Poller in New York just about that time, told Poller that CBS was very happy with the job that he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.779" offset="3502477">By that time, over 200,000 owners of sets in the Milwaukee area had invested over $4 million in converters for UHF reception, and Poller already was on a profitable basis with sales of about $110,000 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.309" offset="3584606">But it was only a few days before or after these compliments from CBS that CBS asked the Birmingham, Alabama businessman named Holt with whom they've had some business connection to come to New York to discuss doing a very hush-hush job for CBS in Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.280" offset="3672482">Holt came to New York, met the top management of CBS and agreed to accept the job which was to go to Milwaukee and try to get an option to buy Bartell's WOKY station.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.821" offset="3734653">Holt went to Milwaukee and in a few days returned to New York with an option to buy WOKY for $335,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="964.782" offset="3962546">Salant, one of the Vice Presidents of CBS, testified that CBS must have known about Poller's intention to improve his facility in this manner, for he said that Poller kept CBS fully informed of his plans, and Poller's affidavit said that CBS encouraged him to go ahead.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.309" offset="4320632">I shall dwell on that a little more in detail as admitted by my -- CBS, knowing Poller's plans and knowing of this new lease that he had taken, said nothing about it's dealings with Bartell's for WOKY.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.016" offset="4411434">About a month and a half after the option was obtained, FCC approved this rule allowing the networks to acquire two UHF stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.336" offset="4464724">Poller had once wrote to Stanton, President of CBS, telling him about the new construction and promotional work he was engaged in, and said that if CBS wanted to buy a UHF station, Poller would be glad to talk to it about selling his station, WCAN.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.095" offset="4543718">Stanton, with the option on WOKY in his pocket, wrote to Poller that he wasn't interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.448" offset="4585200">Without a word of warning, a few days later, CBS sent Poller a telegram canceling its affiliation agreement, no reason assigned or explanation offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.832" offset="4642670">It is not difficult to guess what happened when Poller got the telegram.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.323" offset="4660642">He rushed to New York and unsuccessfully protested the cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.299" offset="4684570">Salant of CBS was amazed that Poller protested the cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.965" offset="4711215">He told Poller that that was one of the hazards of the business, that CBS would buy its own station, and cancel out its affiliate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.063" offset="4747577">He said to him, “You don't oppose the inevitable, you don't oppose the normal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.456" offset="4769207">Well, Poller was really in difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.903" offset="4779029">His affiliation agreement with CBS was cancelled and both NBC and ABC had or about or were about to enter into affiliation agreements with the only two VHF stations in Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.682" offset="4846111">Poller had on his hands, his 15 years studio lease, his construction contract and his expensive equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.016" offset="4879444">So we come to the last act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.801" offset="4890624">As Salant describes it, in the course of our conversation, the suggestion developed that CBS might buy the physical equipment, studio lease and construction contract, but he told Poller right off the back that CBS wouldn't do a thing about it unless Poller said that he would continue in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.673" offset="4986023">This has to find Salant probably had nothing to do with the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.276" offset="5012459">Our standards of contract, I would like to think, have nothing to do with the antitrust laws and they are four times as high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.815" offset="5050598">I need not tell you that Poller said what CBS tell them that he had to say if he wanted to make his deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.891" offset="5082885">He testified, “I knew I had a gun at my temple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.095" offset="5099708">I had to say yes, and I said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.686" offset="5110157">Then I made every effort to comply.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.148" offset="5123950">Thereupon, CBS agreed to buy Poller's station for $500,000 and told Poller that he could have the poor WOKY equipment for which CBS had no use when it bought Poller's superior equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1516.082" offset="6167698">As a matter of fact, so clear was it to Poller that he could not continue after the station was sold to CBS, but already in January, two months before closing under his contract with CBS, in anticipation of the discontinuance of its business, the stockholders of Midwest had adopted the plan of liquidation and dissolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.240" offset="6264351">When Poller got the WOKY equipment, put it in storage, the WCAN-TV was out of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1551.332" offset="6308655">It kept its permit alive, but has not operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.965" offset="6327254">There is no evidence of the subsequent events except that later, a man named Storer who had wanted to buy Poller's station but had been discouraged by CBS from doing so, acquired a third VHF station in Milwaukee whereupon CBS and he entered into an affiliation agreement, where that VHF station and CBS promptly closed WOKY, its UHF station thus confirming what Poller had said from the beginning that CBS planned to destroy any hope that UHF stations would be successful on a commercial plane in protection of its vested greater interest in VHF operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.918" offset="6527039">These indeed are the outlines of the course of events that led to the silencing of Poller's UHF station.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.302" offset="6672593">These courts also considered that they themselves were the jury, should determine, whose testimony they believed and decide the motion to dismiss on the basis of this belief incredibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.507" offset="6725360">With all due respect, I submit that this record -- this method of disposing of a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, that judicial atomic bomb, shows a complete misunderstanding of the scope of such a motion and can produce a fall-out which will wreck the whole theory of pretrial preparation of jury cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.449" offset="6829119">In the first place, it assumes that a record like the one here represents the entire case that can be presented to the jury, and therefore, as a safe basis on which to render a verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.422" offset="6905083">Every trial lawyer knows that pretrial procedure never was designed or used to bring out the entire case of either side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.837" offset="6946670">If as the lower court here thought, these trial procedures presented all that there was in the way of evidence and if in addition, the Court on motion for summary judgment might pass on the credibility of such witnesses as filed pretrial affidavits or gave pretrial depositions, there would be very little need for juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.640" offset="7037889">All cases could be determined on summary judgment, probably to the great delight of the trial courts which shudder at the thought of time consuming antitrust jury cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.315" offset="7088671">Certainly, neither side is obliged to call any witnesses pretrial certainly not all the witnesses it may wish to call neither as either side required to ask any witness on cross-examination, all the questions, it will want to ask the witness in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.976" offset="7159306">The essential purpose of each side pretrial is to get as much damaging evidence from the other side as it can to use at the trial while revealing as little of its own evidence as is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.958" offset="7219179">In the second place, the Court on consideration of motions to dismiss may not base their action or their determination of the credibility of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.268" offset="7260453">That is solely a function of the jury which sees and hears the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.896" offset="7282918">The function of Rule 56 and it is a most important one, is to permit the dismissal of an action where there are no questions of fact which would entitle the plaintiff to go to a jury, the pure unadulterated questions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.966" offset="7347284">Because this is the essential feature of my argument, I must mention the leading case on the use and the views of the motions for summary judgment is Arnstein against Porter in a 154 F.2d which is not in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.041" offset="7419486">Judge Jerome Frank's opinion in that case, presents my argument on my -- on this point so much better than I can, but except for a possible accusation of plagiarism, I should've copied it in toto instead of using my own language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.235" offset="7480299">I quote just a few sentences from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.817" offset="7494614">“Although part of plaintiff's testimony on deposition, does seem fantastic, yet plaintiff's credibility, even as to those improbabilities should be left to jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.437" offset="7541112">It follows that as credibility is unavoidably involved, a genuine question of material fact presents itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.292" offset="7576534">It has been said, that as the appearance and manner of the witness is often a complete antidote to what he testifies, we cannot very well overestimate the importance of having the witness examine and cross-examine in the presence of the court and jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.351" offset="7644766">This brings us to the consideration of the questions of fact which should have been left to a jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.679" offset="7674128">First, we mentioned three general principles of law which are relevant to our discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.741" offset="7698369">The first is, like where there are number of acts, all calculated to bring about one result, if the result is illegal, it is not safe by reason of the fact that some of the individual acts or even all of them individually leading up to the final result maybe legal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2606.117" offset="10527848">Just what will be developed at a trial, when he and his associates are examined, we cannot tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.135" offset="10551881">However, the evidence is clear that Bartell's, long before closing the CBS under their option agreement with Holt, knew that CBS was the interested party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.373" offset="10596916">With this information, they nevertheless went ahead and completed their deal, surely knowing what the result would be as far as Poller was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.750" offset="10630353">If knowing that, they went ahead and carried out the option agreement, the jury may find that Bartell's joined the conspiracy since they could not have been compelled to complete their agreement with CBS when they found out that in the circumstances of the matter, the agreement violated the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.010" offset="10707362">What testimony would be brought out of the trial if the case from other witnesses, nobody can tell at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.726" offset="10734320">There were three other CBS people of the meeting with Holt in New York from whom nothing has been -- has been heard, the three other shareholders of WOKY from whom nothing has been heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.565" offset="10785625">As we've said, there is no obligation on Poller pretrial to call all the witnesses that he had or to examine those who were called as exhaustively as he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.199" offset="10832123">If as we have argued, the jury may find that there was a conspiracy among CBS and others, we come to the next question, was the conspiracy in violation of the antitrust laws?</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.716" offset="10878203">Court of Appeals thought as a matter of law that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.786" offset="10894503">Judge Washington thought that this was a question of fact for a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.574" offset="10913625">We consider the purpose and the effect of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.975" offset="10927313">What was the purpose of the conspiracy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.747" offset="10938389">There is not a word in the record from any CBS witness which answers the question of why CBS undertook the destruction of Poller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.506" offset="10973393">What explanation CBS may give at a trial, we do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.566" offset="10993664">We assert that the purpose of CBS was to buy Poller's station as cheaply as possible in order to own and operate WOKY as the only UHF station in the Milwaukee area with the effect on competition described hereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.537" offset="11061478">We can see that CBS denied all of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.761" offset="11074435">We also admit that the incomplete record now before this Court on pretrial evidence does not go nearly so far toward proof as we expect to go on the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.730" offset="11122291">However, what other reason could CBS have had?</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.252" offset="11136397">We start out with the undisputed fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.697" offset="11146115">Poller was an exceptionally able and successful station operator, was producing good results with his UHF station through not only exceptionally of good by highly surprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.190" offset="11196165">Up to the time of the cancellation of the affiliation agreement, CBS had had no complaint against Poller, any quarrel or disagreement with him concerning any matter connected with his operation of the station or his relations with CBS.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.825" offset="11262621">The next circumstance is that it is not normal to terminate an affiliation agreement where this agreeable situation exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.910" offset="11298983">Stanton testified, “We don't change any affiliation agreement because of when it is based on performance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.971" offset="11331271">Then he was asked, “Where the operator is performing well and the station is prosperous and things are satisfactory, it is advantageous to you, you'll normally continue regardless of the two-year limitation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.199" offset="11384142">That is absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.187" offset="11396159">In spite of this general policy all through the case, appears statements by Stanton and by Salant that since they had refused Poller's request to modify the six months cancellation notice, Poller should have known better than to make a long-term lease, build a fine new station as if the six months cancellation notice was an exception or provision in the CBS affiliation agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.165" offset="11508067">As the matter of fact, the record show that in -- I beg your pardon.</text>

            <text syncTime="2859.291" offset="11540564">-- as if it was unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.889" offset="11550908">Now, I am about to say that in the record, it appears that 75 of their affiliation agreements contain cancellation clauses of six months or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.764" offset="11594480">No affiliation agreement could be for more than two years under the FCC regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.707" offset="11618200">If affiliates could not depend on more than one year which is the longest cancellation notice provided in any of the affiliation agreements, how could the industry ever have been built?</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.157" offset="11663966">If it was extremely unwise with the six months cancellation notice for an affiliate to invest the large amount in his station, it would be only slightly less reckless for him to do it with the one year cancellation notice and all the stations in the whole industry would have been built on a makeshift basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.463" offset="11741184">The fact is that in spite of the short-term of these affiliation agreements, the whole stability of the industry depends and has been built on the supposition that affiliation agreements will be renewed indefinitely as long as the station operator is loyal and skillful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.205" offset="11816208">Stanton himself, President of CBS, recognized this and agreed that “broadcasters invest large sums of money in stations in reliance on the affiliation agreement even though they know that it is terminable in the two-year period.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.330" offset="11884648">Although as we have said, CBS has not advanced any explanation of why it withdrew its affiliation agreement from Poller, both Stanton and Salant have pretended that their most adherent wish was that Poller would continue in business in competition with their WOKY station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.536" offset="11961553">Stanton said, “All I was interested in doing, looking back on it, was seeing that we didn't diminish the number of stations operating in the community.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.644" offset="12001991">And Salant, his -- the assistant who handled this transaction said, “I said to Poller that I didn't want CBS or me to be in a position where we were acquiring one station and putting another off the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.675" offset="12062072">And I told him I would not consider buying his equipment unless I was sure, as sure as one could be and I was sure too that there would be the same number of stations on the air after this whole thing was completed as there were now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.825" offset="12126647">The jury may believe this, but there is enough evidence in the record to allow the jury to disbelieve the sincerity, the CBS's protestations that it desired or expected Poller to remain in business in competition with CBS.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.117" offset="12195819">It is true that in the agreement Poller said that he continued -- intended to continue to operate his station, but as the agreement itself shows, CBS did not agree to provide any location for its operation since there was no location in which Poller could operate a station when he got Bartell's old equipment, there was nothing for him to do except put it in the warehouse which is what he did, which was perfectly obvious to CBS.</text>

            <text syncTime="3094.815" offset="12482644">He's been in business about two or three months or longer than Bartell's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.455" offset="12517230">So as I say, the jury may decide that CBS's insistence on keeping Poller in business was nothing but pretence, and that both CBS and Poller knew very well that when CBS bought Poller's equipment and location for their own station, he was through and that was the purpose of their purchase of WOKY in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.014" offset="12607404">The reasons they bought Poller's equipment and locations were first, they wanted to be sure that Poller had a fast and sure demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.592" offset="12645752">The second was if they had a bad conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.472" offset="12657246">As Salant said at this transaction which he had engineered, it was not the sort of thing you enjoy or appreciate, surely a under statement, not that the Sherman Act has any insurance against business cruelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.704" offset="12722239">The third was that it was a tremendous benefit to CBS.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.975" offset="12739271">Together, the bargain price, a brand new station with fine equipment in working order and to be able to continue without interruption, the operation which Poller was performing so well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.097" offset="12787754">As to the Bartell equipment, CBS -- CBS had no use for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.428" offset="12813040">It wasn't even testified that Poller asked for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.051" offset="12827564">The real purpose of giving this to Poller was to create some pretence that Poller would stay in business but the pretence became quite transparent when it was obvious that when he got the equipment, he had no place to put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.916" offset="12887019">Having considered the purposes of the CBS activities, we now consider their effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.320" offset="12912619">Assuming that a jury found that there was a conspiracy among the defendants to get Poller's station for CBS-TV, could the jury find that the conspiracy had the effect of a restraint of trade or an attempt to monopolize the Sherman Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.759" offset="12986389">We submit that a jury surely could so find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.634" offset="13001958">In the first place, the conspiracy directly affected the Milwaukee area market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.095" offset="13027767">Before CBS bought WOKY and used its leverage as a network to force Poller to sell his station, there were two independent UHF stations in the Milwaukee area competing not only with each other, but also with the Milwaukee area VHF stations for local and national spot advertising and local news programs with the further potentiality of competing for affiliations with any of the three national networks no matter how unlikely it was that Bartell's with their inferior operation could win such an affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.103" offset="13199757">After CBS bought WOKY, Poller was out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.336" offset="13224730">There was only one UHF station in the Milwaukee area and that was owned and operated not by an independent but by the largest of the three giant networks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.165" offset="13272064">This naturally in the words of the opinion in U.S. against du Pont led to the insulation from free competition of the Milwaukee area markets for local and spot advertising and local news programs and remove the possibility of competition for network affiliations as far as Poller's station was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.681" offset="13366105">That station no longer existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.515" offset="13377390">As to the VHF stations, there was one competitor less, as to UHF, there was competitor at all left.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.562" offset="13413648">That market was closed completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.319" offset="13424619">It is no defense to CBS that Bartell's might not have survived even if CBS had not entered the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.785" offset="13458474">It is true, within our opinion, a UHF station in Milwaukee without a network affiliation could not be profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.216" offset="13492224">How long Bartell's might have lived, we do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.628" offset="13505912">There is no evidence with respect to his earning history or its net worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.307" offset="13524616">In any event, it was in the market competing with Poller until CBS put through its deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.401" offset="13548962">These were the considerations that Judge Washington pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.796" offset="13566516">He thought that Poller's case was stronger than Westinghouse's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.400" offset="13580936">In that case, at least there would have been as many stations left in Philadelphia and Cleveland after the exchange as there were before whereas in our case, there was one less station when Poller was put out of business in Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.870" offset="13638823">As to Section 2 of the Sherman Act, Judge Washington found substantial indications that CBS had monopoly power over UHF in Milwaukee when it cancelled Poller's affiliation and the jury might so find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.334" offset="13704756">If the anti-competitive effect of CBS were limited to Milwaukee, that would be enough, and if only Poller were injured that would be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.833" offset="13742686">But in fact, the anti-competitive effect to what CBS did in the Milwaukee market affected televisions throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.015" offset="13779466">Every UH -- UHF operator in the United States was put on notice that if he established a successful UHF station in his community, CBS, NBC or ABC for its own purposes might come in to his community by -- apply for a new license or buy the license of the competing UHF operator and do to the successful UHF operator in that community what it did to Poller in Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.234" offset="13896286">The fact that the number of stations, the networks could buy was limited, would not change this situation because no operator could tell whether one of those it could buy would be his.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.535" offset="14129507">But beyond this, by acquiring an exclusive position in what CBS had selected as one of the two best markets for UHF in the United States, CBS could conduct its operations in such a way as to influence adversely the growth of UHF throughout the United States in protection of its vastly greater interest in VHF.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.220" offset="14224280">Ultimately as we have said, CBS abandoned its UHF Milwaukee station when it got an affiliation with the third new VHF station in Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.085" offset="14275688">“Will Salant's words be prophetic?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.256" offset="14284361">This is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.802" offset="14290631">I think it would be the kiss of death to UHF if either NBC or CBS abandoned a UHF station.</text>

            <text syncTime="3692.854" offset="14874833">And it does no good to talk about getting called up and having trade names, code names and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.542" offset="14921540">Perhaps the Court doesn't agree that that's the way this business should be conducted, but this Court has held in the Eastern Railroad case that disputes about business ethics are not questions of antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.159" offset="14996041">Even unfair means of competition, which Judge Washington referred to below, have nothing to do with private suits for treble damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="4117.218" offset="16572270">Here in Washington, CBS has an affiliation contract with WTOP channel 9, so that if you turn on to channel 9, you will either get some local program, either of local interest or local news or within certain hours, if you turn it on, you will get a network program; a network program which goes practically over the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.395" offset="16684910">So that as my friend said, 90% of the people, or 80% of the people can see it if they wish, they can flip the knob and look at an NBC program or they can flip the knob again and look at an ABC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.099" offset="16751783">They can flip it again and see an independent local television program, so that to speak about monopoly by CBS or lack of competition borders on the absurdity.</text>

            <text syncTime="4880.695" offset="19626193">Now to add insult to injury, because we think it was, included in this $2 million, it's conceded that his equipment, the actual physical assets were worth only a half a million, that's what we paid.</text>
