            <label>Mr. I. Henry Kutz</label>
            <text syncTime="39.074" offset="259636">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.409" offset="273011">In this consolidated peti -- cross-petitions, my associate, Mr. Wilkenfeld will state the facts and give the argument in Number 268 in which the United States is respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.557" offset="365589">With the Court's permission, I will argue Number 190 in which the United States is the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.714" offset="410206">The issues in Number 190, and the questions are quite desperate in the two cross-petitions, the issue in Number 190 is whether a taxpayer husband realized capital gain when he transferred to his former wife, a stock which had appreciated in value during his ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.262" offset="532459">And when the transfer was made in consideration of the wife's release of his marital obligations to her, the Court of Claims have -- has held that no capital gain was realized but in so ruling expressly recognized conflict with decisions of the Second and the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.834" offset="666728">On the other hand, it found support in the reasoning of the decision by the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.529" offset="705494">The facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.709" offset="718242">Both taxpayer and his former wife were residence of Delaware and all the property involved was located in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.197" offset="764113">Taxpayer was the director and vice president of the du com -- du Pont Company and the stock in issue is du Pont stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.329" offset="804655">Serious marital disputes arose between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.114" offset="823777">And by July 1954, they had both retained attorneys and property settlement negotiations commenced being conducted through the attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.776" offset="886471">In November 1954, a formal property settlement agreement was arrived at and signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.154" offset="927953">And the court explicitly found that all the property involved in the settlement negotiations was owned by Mr. Davis, subject only to her marital rights under the laws of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.336" offset="1008724">Those were the marital rights of the common law state she had.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.385" offset="1028890">I will describe in a little more detail later.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.734" offset="1042265">She had a dower, the common law dower interest in his real estate, otherwise, no property rights in his estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.987" offset="1183326">The agreement was wrong to say that this and this shall be transferred to her for her support and this and that, including the stock here involved, shall be transferred to her in division of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.494" offset="1245393">But -- in as much as she had no -- no property in the stock, it will be our contention that that's a mere language and could give her no property.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.315" offset="1308609">The -- so far as pertinent, the agreement provided that he was to deliver to her 500 shares of the du Pont stock, agreement having been made in November 1954.</text>
