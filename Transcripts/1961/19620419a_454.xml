            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 454 Bernard Silber, Petitioner, versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.105" offset="131741">Mr. Rabinowitz.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="13.190" offset="156087">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.682" offset="170088">Mr. Silber is another one of those cases that came between the decisions in Wilkinson and Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.656" offset="201958">He was called in the same inquiry, same investigation as Mr. Grumman in the immediate preceding case.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.698" offset="234141">He was represented by me at the congressional committee hearing and at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.164" offset="267995">He was tried a week or two after the Allen case, although his testimony before the Committee was some months before Allen's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.882" offset="318882">He was convicted for violation of Section 192 on three Counts for refusal to answer three questions and received a sentence of four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.948" offset="371127">The subject under inquiry as announced by the Committee was communist penetration into the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.209" offset="396204">It has been discussed by previous counsel on the previous case and I might add that this was the fourth hearing held by congressional committees on this very same subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.004" offset="455346">The petitioner appeared subject to the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.037" offset="471542">He said that he had been employed by Western Union for 41 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.236" offset="500276">He said that he had been a member of the Communist Party, that he had joined the Communist Party in 1948, that he had -- that hearing was in 1957, that he had been a member for about a year, that he had attended meetings he said rarely during that period of time and then he dropped out because he found that he wasn't much interested and that he was interested in other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.714" offset="634232">Now, one would have thought that if this Committee was interested in sabotage, espionage, communist control of the communications industry, this man would have been affined.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.144" offset="691911">He was a man who admitted having been a member of the Communist Party for a period of a year in the communications industry, employed by Western Union presumably in a position to give the very kind of information that the Committee was interested at.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.414" offset="765053">No questions with relation to espionage, sabotage, communist control were asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.856" offset="798804">Instead, the Committee following its incessant and unremitting quest for names moved immediately into that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.993" offset="851362">The first question which is the subject of the indictment here Count 1 was, “Was the person who recruited you a communications' worker?"</text>
            <text syncTime="200.973" offset="907264">And Mr. Silber had answered the questions up to that time but at least he bought and he said he must decline to answer this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.594" offset="957733">I might say that Mr. Silber was an elderly gentleman, now on pension, not very articulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.593" offset="993782">And when he said I must decline, the Committee counsel asked him why.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.841" offset="1042787">And he said on the basis of the Watkins and Sweezy decisions and also that Mr. Grumman who had testified two weeks before had filed a long statement with the Committee and he said, “I want to rely on all of the grounds that was stated by Mr. Grumman in his testimony which include the lack of jurisdiction of the Committee, rights under the First Amendment of vagueness of the resolution setting up the Committee, the lack of a Pertinency of the question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="261.964" offset="1151248">All of those grounds which had been suggested by the Watkins decision which is I say, had come down six weeks before.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.325" offset="1184684">And counsel at this point said to him, counsel for the Committee said to him, asked leave to -- “Explain to the witness why this question was pertinent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="284.830" offset="1242676">And he said, “This Committee is considering legislation to safeguard this nation from possible espionage or sabotage facilities by Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="295.579" offset="1285726">If the person who enlisted you which of the Communist Party was engaged in the communications field, that person undoubtedly would have some information which will be of used to this Committee in developing facts and respecting communist penetration of the communications facilities of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.895" offset="1355003">And the witness was directed to answer the question again and I mean -- and witness said, “I'm very sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.325" offset="1392724">My conscience prohibits me from answering this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="326.330" offset="1408711">And on three or four other occasions during the course of the hearing when other questions of a similar nature were asked, he repeated the grounds that had previously been given summarizing in a layman's fashion when he conceived to be the hauling for the Watkins case, conceived I regret to say incorrectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.573" offset="1489690">He said, “I'm sorry but I have a conscience.”</text>
            <text syncTime="350.527" offset="1505468">As a matter of fact, he said the same thing at sentence that his conscience prohibited from -- him from naming other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.558" offset="1541622">Count 2 was stricken.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.463" offset="1549249">Count 3 was, “Were there any officers of your union, members of the Communist Party at the time you were a member of the Communist Party?</text>
            <text syncTime="370.715" offset="1586239">And 3, “Were any of the present officers of your union, members of the Communist Party at the time you were in the party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="379.486" offset="1621347">Although, there was an explanation of pertinency with respect to Count 1, there was no explanation of pertinency with respect to Counts 2 and 4 except that after he had answered the question and had -- after he'd refused to answer the question and had been directed to do so by the Committee and he had refused to do so, Mr. Shera, a member of the Committee said, “And these questions were asked you for the same reason that Mr. Arens, our counsel gave you for asking the other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.447" offset="1769200">They are pertinent for the same reasons that he advanced, namely that it would give the Committee an opportunity to cost deal other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.006" offset="1807444">Now, this is an illustration I think of the Committee's never ending quest for names.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.707" offset="1842239">The witness was not asked about his activities in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.123" offset="1867839">He was not asked about espionage or sabotage or any of the other subjects the Committee is allegedly interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.982" offset="1899290">All he was asked for was the names of other persons and although he expressed a perfect willingness and said, “I am perfectly willing to tell you everything about myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.643" offset="1941922">My conscience does not permit me to give the names of other persons.”</text>
            <text syncTime="465.649" offset="1965955">The name of other persons was the only subject that the Committee was interested in.</text>

            <text syncTime="482.894" offset="2034918">Well, I think there are many reasons in the first place and one of the considerations is that a grand jury investigation is by law subject to secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.816" offset="2102627">What a witness says at a grand jury investigation is not a matter of public knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.481" offset="2225298">If it were sufficiently relevant to lawsuit, perhaps -- if it were relevant, perhaps he could not have answered on these grounds or he would be more accurate, have had the opportunity of taking risks of not answering and answering.</text>

            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="557.822" offset="2334699">Because the purpose of a congressional committee had always understood was to secure information for legislative purposes, and not to engage in a program of exposure for exposures sake if I may quote language from -- I am sure some decisions of this Court either majority or minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.950" offset="2443160">This Committee asked this witness no questions about his activities in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.209" offset="2468237">It was apparently not interested in anything that he did as a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.206" offset="2496240">It said nothing to him about espionage, sabotage, or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.911" offset="2515048">All that was interested in was the never ending quest for names and names and more names.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.305" offset="2544619">And I submit that the purpose of this Committee and this is not the first time that this has been called, I am sure for the attention of this Court is not in my opinion, although I regret to say not the opinion of the Court, a true legislative purpose but as a purpose of exposure, a purpose of publishing as many names and more names and more names.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.205" offset="2644198">This matter has been considered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.740" offset="2654333">It was considered by the Court in many of these decisions and this is a perfect illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.161" offset="2680038">He was a witness who admitted membership in the Communist Party, was asked no questions at all about his activities in the Communist Party, was asked no questions about espionage or sabotage or all of those other things that we are told are the subject matter of the inquiry here.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.413" offset="2757047">All he was asked for are what are the names of other persons?</text>
            <text syncTime="667.271" offset="2772407">He even indicated their willingness and said, “I'm willing to tell you anything about myself, my conscience does not permit me to tell you about other persons.”</text>
            <text syncTime="677.857" offset="2814830">This it seems to me is a perfect illustration of the lack of true legislative purpose of this Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.477" offset="2845236">Now, I realize that this Court has -- majority of this Court at least, has passed on this subject before and I'm not going to repeat the argument that I made in the Yellin case because among other reasons, I don't have the time for it and I don't want to go through the same the thing twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.241" offset="2916289">But here is a perfect illustration as I say of the Committee's never ending quest for names and names and names and more names.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.814" offset="2950666">And when it does get a witness who is prepared to say, “Yes, I was a member of the Communist Party, I'll tell you everything I want to know about myself but I cannot in good conscience answer about others,” they don't ask him about himself but they only ask about others.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.908" offset="3022973">At the close of the hearing, Mr. Doyle who was chairing a meeting complemented the petitioner on his frankness in admitting his membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.648" offset="3065919">He complemented him on his good sense and getting out of the Communist Party when he did and he invited him to help the Committee and the witness said, “I'm sorry, I have a conscience to protect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="756.258" offset="3128404">The case was tried a few weeks after the Yellin case and it likewise resulted in the conviction this time in the sentence of only four months, the Yellin conviction had been for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.139" offset="3187963">The petitioner urges several grounds for reversal here, and I am not going to -- oh incidentally, let me add one more thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.592" offset="3229759">At the close of the case, I offered the same testimony that Professor Emerson had given in the Yellin case as an offer of proof in this case for the purpose of proving that the -- well, the same purposes I had -- as I had in the Yellin case namely, issue that went to the question of just a cause for a congressional investigation and a balance of -- a balance of -- and the matter of whether there was balance of the interest involved in the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.321" offset="3400704">The Court refused to accept the offer of proof, however, it is -- it is printed in the record as it is in the Yellin record that was submitted in writing and the same issues are raised here as were raised in the Yellin -- in the Yellin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.972" offset="3463293">I'm not going to reargue those.</text>

            <text syncTime="876.620" offset="3609893">My first argument is that the questions here were not pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.266" offset="3632462">This man had been out of the Communist Party for nine years at the time he was testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.613" offset="3657853">He could offer no testimony as to the relevance of any matter that had been before Congress at the time that he was testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.562" offset="3685648">He had no contact with the Communist Party for eight or nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.557" offset="3705605">The only questions he was asked were questions which related to the membership of other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.085" offset="3727757">The Committee showed a complete disinterest in his own activities in the Communist Party and asked him no questions concerning him.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.438" offset="3769135">And it is our contention that because of the remoteness of his membership and because mere listing of names cannot be pertinent, it's a sort of a discovery proceeding and not a legislative investigation that the questions were not pertinent to the subject matter under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.130" offset="3867878">On the question that Judge Brennan asked namely the probable cause for the issuing of a subpoena to the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.744" offset="3910301">Now in the Barenblatt case, you will recall that the Court said, and this was referred to in the previous case, nor did petitioner's appearance as a witness followed from indiscriminate dragnet procedures lacking in probable cause for belief that he possessed information which might be -- might be helpful to the subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.472" offset="4001311">Now, it is my contention that the words probable cause have a meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.593" offset="4029733">They have a meaning in our law and it's a meaning which is found in many Fourth Amendment cases and the meaning which is found in our criminal law --</text>

            <text syncTime="1024.915" offset="4203081">But we inquired at the trial at some length as to why Mr. Silber was called and we found that the following were the reasons that were given for calling him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.800" offset="4250624">In the first place, he had access to the messages and facilities of Western Union which would present sabotage and espionage possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.236" offset="4304332">His position would be considered important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.013" offset="4319378">He signed Communist Party petitions on behalf of Israel Amter and Benjamin Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.615" offset="4353860">Now, there's no indication in the record as to when he signed those petitions for Benjamin Davis and Israel Amter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.977" offset="4387297">Amter had a last run for political office as far as I can make out in the year 1939, so that was the last time he could have signed the petition for Israel Amter, 1939 would have been 20 years prior to his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.626" offset="4457827">Davis had run for Attorney General of the United States on a Communist Party ticket and had run for other offices on the Communist Party ticket in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.805" offset="4490637">But the last time, he ran was 1946, so that was 12 years prior to the date that he ran for office.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.507" offset="4665448">The next reason was that in 1940, the New York Times had listed his name as the name of a person whom someone had called a Red in the course of inter -- a factional dispute in the American Labor Party that was the other -- another reason for calling this witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.345" offset="4756773">And finally, his son whose first name is unknown, was also identified as a member of the Communist Party by a confidential source.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.890" offset="7902960">Apparently, Silber so understood the question because he said, “I can't do this because it's against my conscience” and at the close of the testimony likewise, he said, “I cannot name the names of other people because it's against my conscience.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.115" offset="7971819">It's true that now the Government says, possibly there would have been other relevance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.313" offset="8244642">The first question, and this is our page 3 of the record, was he, and now that you have brackets, [the person who recruited defendant in the Communist Party] of communications worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.545" offset="8289573">The answer to that is yes or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.411" offset="8296991">It's not the name of a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.597" offset="8305768">Now the fact that the next question might have asked the name of the person, he should've -- if he was going object to identifying people, that was the time to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.708" offset="8346206">You can't start at the beginning of the hearing and say, “Well, I know what you're aiming at ultimately and that therefore, I'm not going to answer any questions even though the objection I've raised doesn't have anything to do with the questions you're now asking.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.021" offset="8403466">In Count 3, where any of the officers of their union, members of the Communist Party at the time you were a member of the Communist Party?</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.759" offset="8430425">Answer that yes or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.953" offset="8435231">It's not -- nobody's name could possibly be a direct answer unless you're going to elucidate the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.138" offset="8463966">In Count 4 it's the same thing where any of the present officers of your union, members of the Communist Party at the time that you were in the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.559" offset="8497612">So none of these -- none of these questions involved the naming of names.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.313" offset="8520600">Now, it's true for pertinency purposes, it's arguable that we're bound by the explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.532" offset="8541497">We have an argument that we're not bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.151" offset="8547976">But for First Amendment purposes at least, we're bound by what the questions asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.136" offset="8567933">The questions did not ask for names.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.527" offset="8577442">The First Amendment issue here is whether a Committee can ask a witness concerning other persons after all, they're barely few questions that don't concern other persons unless you're going to ask the man, are you a Communist?</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.809" offset="8626657">That's just about the only question you could ask him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.054" offset="8635538">If you ask him, “What group you were a member of in the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.646" offset="8673991">That concerns other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.511" offset="8657377">If you ask him, “What are the plans of the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.894" offset="8678902">It's almost impossible to think of any questions other than his personal membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.628" offset="8697919">And that kind of a question if it were the only thing that the Committee was interested in might well be just exposure for the sake of exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.628" offset="8729893">Now, the context of petitioner Silber's refusal to answer is the same as that of petitioner Grumman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.400" offset="8760926">And therefore, I will not repeat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.700" offset="8766151">The Committee was investigating Communist activities in the communications industry at large amounts of evidence seduced at this hearing about the danger from this kind of -- from Communist in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.895" offset="8826964">Petitioner Silber's contentions concerning the First Amendment are extremely similar to those of Petitioner Grumman and Petitioner Yellin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.223" offset="8856221">Therefore, the Government's answer is virtually the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.145" offset="8867924">The facts are virtually the same as those in Barenblatt and Braden and Wilkinson and therefore, we submit that those three cases are controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.207" offset="8908152">Government is obviously an important, vitally important interest of protecting the communications' network of this country from Communist subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.697" offset="8942111">Petitioner Silber was not pillory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.830" offset="8950680">The questions are clearly relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.257" offset="8960397">Now, petitioner Silber's main contention and it's hard to say whether it's under the First or under the Fourth Amendments is that he was called as the result of indiscriminate dragnet procedures, lacking in probable cause to put -- to put his argument into the terms of the Barenblatt case, and I assume that means in the terms of the First Amendment and not of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.344" offset="9052766">I may say at the start, the petitioner, I believe, is wrong when he says that no other case which is been decided by this Court involves the witness which who had not been identified before a committee and sworn testimony as a Communist.</text>

            <text syncTime="3762.413" offset="15152985">On the contrary, there's a well-established part of our jurisprudence that a citizen has a legal and civic duty to testify before properly constituted authority as to matters within his knowledge even if the expense of his friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.950" offset="15215156">And we submit that it's frivolous even to suggest that a witness whether it's before a grand jury, in a criminal trial or before a congressional committee can simply refuse to discuss the activities of other persons because he does not want to be what he calls an informer.</text>
