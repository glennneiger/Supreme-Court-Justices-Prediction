            <text syncTime="441.799" offset="1870555">The District Court said, as we read this opinion, that the Commission had ignored the affirmative evidence of the supporting shipper, Boeing, specific needs that no consideration were given to special services, which the District Court said in fact could not be supplied by the common carriers here.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.804" offset="1986539">And that the Commission had not made adequate findings respecting the distinct transportation needs of the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.263" offset="2040456">I think from the rather full statement of facts I gave yesterday and others facts from the record and which the Commission has found and we set them out rather fully in our brief, that it's just not true that the Commission did not consider the evidence of the shipper, Boeing's needs, and that it did not consider the ability of the protesting common carrier to meet those special needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.977" offset="2171277">It summarized the needs in great detail and it found specifically that the protesting common carrier could provide exactly the same sort of service as was proposed by J-T, the appellant, and it recited in detail the things that the protesting common carrier was accustomed to do and would do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.542" offset="2265527">And as a result, the Commission concluded that the protesting common carrier was fully able to meet the needs of Boeing.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.265" offset="2312443">So, I think it's just patent from the Commission's report, in any fair reading of it, that it is just not the case that the Commission ignored affirmative evidence of Boeing's needs and that it made findings that didn't reflect or touch those needs, that -- that the report is the full answer to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.380" offset="5260936">Generally speaking, it is viewed as adversely effecting the existing carriers because it takes out of circulation, potential traffic, which might become available to them and that this sort of thing if it were to occur as a regular matter authorizing an unneeded competitive service would be inconsistent with preserving sound economic conditions in the motor transportation industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.811" offset="5402624">And I think that sort of thinking is entirely consistent with -- if we go back to 1935, when motor carriers are put on to regulation, with the -- the reasons that they were put under regulations as set forth so succinctly by this Court in the A.T.A. case at 345 U.S., where they pointed out it was the over competition, the instability in the industry which it caused to be put on the regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.311" offset="7996583">Now, at the same time, there are common carriers that transport a very few commodities and U.S.A.C. Transport is one of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.706" offset="8034200">J-T Transport, a contract carrier also hauls a very few commodities, certainly as compared with the general commodity carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.198" offset="8072129">And as a matter of fact, those two are competitive because J-T is now seeking and has been granted temporary authority by this Commission to do something, which very clearly, U.S.A.C. Transport has the right to do and the Commission found that U.S.A.C. Transport could perform this service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.152" offset="8160005">Not only that, there are automobile carriers who handled nothing but automobiles and who are common carriers and who served whatever portion of the public is available to them and there aren't many automobile manufacturers in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.398" offset="8212982">At the same time, there are contract carriers of automobiles holding permits granted by this Commission, which perform service which is almost identical, if not physically identical, with that served by the common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.872" offset="8270869">In addition, there are many other types of common carriers of -- specialty commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.956" offset="8299186">For example, you have the household goods carriers who haul for anybody but they don't haul general commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.514" offset="8325413">They haul that group of commodities falling in the area of the household goods service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.876" offset="8346833">You should find the same thing with tank truck carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.268" offset="8360417">You have common carriers by tank truck and you have contract carriers by tank trunk and they will be both be hauling the same or a limited number of commodities, and these carriers therefore, in a very real sense are competitive the one with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.360" offset="8424782">The question was asked here a bit earlier, whether or not if what the lower court does should become law, there will have been established a sharp departure from practice in the past with respect to what this Commission has done in considering cases when a new application is before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.677" offset="8498030">It's my view and very emphatically so that this would amount to a sharp departure in practice, going all the way back to the beginning of regulation in 1935 and continuing to cases that are being decided week after week and month after month by this Commission in which it shows that it does consider the adequacy of service of existing carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.397" offset="8588936">That is something which in my opinion is specifically brought out by the amendments of -- in 209 (b) in 1957, and furthermore, that language, the word “adequate” itself appears in the National Transportation Policy, the concluding sentence of which imposes upon the Commission the obligation to administer all the sections of Act with due regard to the total policy expressed by Congress there, which includes adequacy and which includes sound economic conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.619" offset="8717876">We think the Commission was fully within its rights and bound by law as a matter of fact to give consideration to every element that it did and to come to the conclusion that it reached in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.335" offset="8772733">And furthermore, if anyone wants to know what adverse effect there might be upon U.S.A.C. Transport, the common carrier of limited commodities, which I here represent along with the others, let me say, just look at the 219 empty vehicles which we moved in a two and half month period, and this in the record from Indianapolis out and on which we had no break and with which by modification which we offer to do have record, we could have used, for transporting the commodities, that are here before the Commission and before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2247.083" offset="9091741">In a very brief period that I have in this argument, I don't think I'll have time to do more than outline our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.577" offset="9121729">But the issues presented in this case are also presented in the Reddish case is to follow and I may be able to elaborate there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.034" offset="9155480">Now, with due respect to my friends on the appellee side, I'm not going to take any time here to argue the question of whether the Commission can't consider adequacy of service or consider the service that the common carriers and other protesters here provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.966" offset="9235205">I think the lower court's decision in both this case and the Reddish case are very ambiguous on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.149" offset="9263940">And I agree strongly with the Commission that they should be clarified in this Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.582" offset="9285674">But I don't really think that there's any serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.822" offset="9298631">If the court was saying, if they can't consider, it was clearly wrong, they have to consider the existing services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.778" offset="9330500">You can't make a determination that makes any sense without knowing what you're starting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.916" offset="9355055">The problem we have is not whether you consider existing services, but how you consider existing services in evaluating the two primary questions which normally are going to be decisive in this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.391" offset="9428929">Now, as Justice Frankfurter said, there are five factors which the Commission is required to consider and there are additional factors because I agree with the Commission that these are not exclusive factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.557" offset="9481592">There may be other factors, which the record will require them to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.898" offset="9506983">But in most cases, in most cases, the problem really comes down to whether the interest of the shipper in securing new service are more important to the National Transportation Policy or less important to the National Transportation Policy than the interest of the existing carriers in protecting their services, the choice is between the effect, in other words, if I may cite, use statutory language between the effect of a denial of the application upon the shippers for whom it is being put forward because contract carrier applications are always put forward by a proposed contract shipper, a transporter for specific shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.091" offset="9731741">The shipper's interest as contrasted with the interest of the existing carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.143" offset="9763924">Now, as we see it, and as the court below saw it too, in passing upon these two basic factors, there are three problems which have risen over the years and which are exemplified in both the J-T and the Reddish cases, which are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.475" offset="9857233">The first of which, to which I'll only advert very briefly here is burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.141" offset="9879907">The Commission has used very loose language in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.090" offset="9895685">It uses very loose language here with respect to whether the shipper or the applicant must show that the protesting carriers are unwilling and unable to do what they intend to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.890" offset="9966947">And to the extent that the Commission puts the burden upon the shipper and the applicant to show what somebody else can do, not only is that illogical but it's clearly contrary to the legislative history of 1957 amendments because the Commission at that time tried to put through an amendment which would've put the burden on the applicants and that was expressly rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.182" offset="10072064">But that isn't quite -- unless you have a different legislative history in mind than I have, what the Commission tried to originally propose is that that such -- such a permit can be granted only if the existing common carriers are unwilling or unable to provide.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.430" offset="10441122">But the problems as Your Honor pointed out, the 1957 Act, in part because that contract carriers' complaint that they were doing this too generally and not looking at the specific facts, it requires them to look at the specific facts and apply their general test to the specific facts of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2714.576" offset="10961690">Now, this is debatable, but we think that, as we look at the record here that this is a conclusion that they not only could've drawn, but that the language would seem to say they drew it outweighs the language, which seems to indicate they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.757" offset="11022399">This isn't a clear problem even in the J-T case Your Honor, because not only does the Commission in its general discussion at pages 38 of the record, talk in terms of shipper needs being merely met by reasonably adequate service of the common carriers, exactly the type of showing, which this Court and the Schaffer found was no -- not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.952" offset="11131173">But on page 49 of the record, it again talks in terms of, whereas here it appears that a motor common carrier is able to furnish a service substantially similar to that proposed by a motor carrier -- by a motor common carrier applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.185" offset="11220093">So there is this problem in the J-T case as well as the Reddish case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.570" offset="11237648">But we agree with Mr. Taylor that when you look at this decision on the whole here, there is enough in here to find that the Commission filed that the existing carrier could fully meet the needs of the shipper and that they're sufficient on the record so that in the very broad leeway that the Commission must necessarily have, this is supportive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3854.564" offset="15521625">This so, I think, gets into the basic problem of the relationship between common carriers and contract carriers and the basic difference in standards for passing upon the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.965" offset="15575228">Unfortunately, our brief does not contain the standards for common carrier applications but I've handed it up to you, 207 of the Act provides that common carriers are to be passed, common carrier applications are to be passed upon in the normal way that a utility application is to be passed upon, i.e. a common carrier must show that the service he wishes to provide is or will be required by present or future public interest and necessity, and that is the standard language for applicant for common carrier facilities and railroads, telephones, telegraph, public utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.521" offset="15769475">Contract carriages are different animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.990" offset="15779297">The standard of Section 209 does not require him to show that there is a public need for the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.352" offset="15812733">Instead, the provisions of Section 209 are that the Commission shall grant a contract carrier application if it is consistent with the public interest and the national transportation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.313" offset="15884622">Now, this distinction which the lower courts mentioned reflects I think a real distinction that Congress was making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.872" offset="15926836">We agree completely with the Commission that the basic reason for regulating contract carriage was to ensure that contract carriers didn't skim the cream off the market and hurt the common carriers upon which the small people in the country necessarily depend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.947" offset="16007189">But the Commission felt, I mean the Congress felt that that was the primary reason for regulating contract carriers and unless there was a demonstrable effect upon the common carriers, there wasn't any need to prevent the small man from buying a truck and going into business providing for the special services of a shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.543" offset="16133517">And therefore, they had this distinction in the standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="4055.391" offset="16324942">The problem they have was that prior to 1957, when they were passing upon an application for a contract carrier applicant, they didn't know what they were passing on and the reason for that was that prior to 1957, a contract carrier application was a hunting license.</text>

            <text syncTime="4078.159" offset="16416057">It was a -- maybe a limited hunting license but it didn't limit the person when he got his permit to serving the particular shippers whose needs he had applied to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.708" offset="16466213">He could go out and get additional shippers and in this Court's decision in the Contract Steel case, which Mr. Taylor mentioned yesterday, the Court made that perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.609" offset="16513860">It said, “As long as he keeps within the general specialization field that he had been licensed for, he is perfectly able and willing to go out and get as many new contracts as he wants.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.590" offset="16569762">Now, that meant -- that meant that despite this difference in standard, the Commission had a real problem because it never could really tell when it made a grant for a contract carrier what its impact was going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.930" offset="16631097">It could not say, “This fellow is going to serve shipper A and B and we can tell what the impact of his serving shipper A and B is because as soon as it got the permit, he could turn around and serve shippers D, E, F and G as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.988" offset="16691284">And therefore, the Commission over the years did evolve a policy of changing the Act and turning around completely.</text>

            <text syncTime="4843.655" offset="19478026">This -- the J-T Transport Company is a contract carrier who has devoted its 20 years of existence to the transportation exclusively of aircraft components.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.366" offset="19540825">We don't talk about aircraft parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.999" offset="19547408">These are great, big components or assemblies that are subcontracted and manufactured at a place apart from the place of final assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.160" offset="19583979">And then, they have to be transported to the production line and they are put into the big air freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.271" offset="19608430">The particular aircraft assemblies, or components as we sometime call them, that are here involved are parts of the B-52 which is the -- it is a big jet transport fighter plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.104" offset="19675826">It's one of the type that met with the disastrous accident this past weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.278" offset="19700485">It has been manufactured since 1952 and is it -- it is still a part of the Air Force's production of fighter planes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.634" offset="19741863">The particular commodity here is called the landing gear bulkhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.939" offset="19763179">That is a great, big 12-foot by 16-foot component that fits up into the airframe from which the wheels, the landing gears are suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.630" offset="19813857">It is made of magnesium, titanium, and aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.676" offset="19834128">Yet, the core, the aft bulkhead is 122 x 181 x 24 inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.442" offset="19873102">That is 11 x 15 x 2 feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.464" offset="19893269">The other one is slightly smaller.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.538" offset="19901524">They weigh practically nothing considering their bulk, their weight in each instance is under 1400 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.121" offset="19927855">They are very expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.553" offset="19933602">Each one way cost about $25,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="4988.376" offset="20056900">There are some fine pictures of the components in the record, pages 144 to 140 -- or pages 141 to 144 in (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.834" offset="20110712">The picture at page 144 is the component in a shipping fixture.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.957" offset="20127222">The shipping fixture goes into the trailer and the component is shipped within those big frames.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.815" offset="20162644">Now, the -- as I say, the job of moving this over the highway is a tremendous one, the J-T Transport Company in their long experience designed a trailer which was a highly specialized trailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.007" offset="20219382">It had to be because one of these components which was 11 feet high had to be carried upright because of strain or stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.657" offset="20258043">So we had to get a component that is 11 feet high into a trailer that is only 12.5 feet at its highest point from the roadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.138" offset="20299943">So they developed what they called an underslung trailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5053.043" offset="20315512">That means one part of the trailer drops down to about eight inches off the highway and the floor, the rest of the trailer is higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.665" offset="20349994">In order to load the components in the shipping fixture, into the trailer, they push them in on tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.992" offset="20387297">When they would get this component over the underslung portion which the floor which had been raised, they had an electric elevator that they installed in each one of these trailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.843" offset="20434735">And that elevator would move the roof and the -- and the floor up at the same time so that the sunken floor was leveled with the rest of the floor so that the component could be pushed in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5094.618" offset="20481860">Once it got there, the elevator lowers the top and the floor down to the point where this big component could ride safely over the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.786" offset="20522506">Now, in addition to the trailer that they have, they also designed and they owned and they furnished these shipping fixtures, copies of which you can see in the record beginning at pages 141 and 144.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.178" offset="20580080">These fixtures were designed so that the components were attached to them in a way to simulate the attachment of these same components when they go into the airframe, so that you avoid strains and stresses in transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.336" offset="20644760">These components are highly susceptible to damage because of strain or stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.303" offset="20668583">If they are jarred, or if they are dropped or if anything lose them, so as to cause the strain.</text>

            <text syncTime="5163.247" offset="20756355">I could tell you some more about the highly specialized nature of the tractor -- I mean, of the trailer and of the shipping fixtures, but I believe that along with the pictures will demonstrate what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.847" offset="20802748">This was no simple kind of an operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.659" offset="20818004">It was a highly complex operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.469" offset="20829288">Now, according to the record here, the shipment moved from the empty trailer or the trailer with the shipping fixtures in it, moved from Wichita to Indianapolis overnight, from Indianapolis after it was loaded back to Wichita overnight as against a rail movement of some three or seven -- up to seven days transit time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.168" offset="20928031">Now, the trailer after it was designed and built, the fixtures after they were designed were submitted to the engineering department of Boeing, who under our contract had the absolute right to reject either the trailer or of the shipping fixtures if they believe that any damage would accrue or if they didn't believe that they were entirely proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.118" offset="21019878">In other words, we simply acted as the agent and we did for Boeing what Boeing would have done by -- for itself if it had engaged in private carriage.</text>

            <text syncTime="5304.468" offset="21321226">That is the way that it moved from Indianapolis to Wichita.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.395" offset="21344946">Now, at page 143, you see one component loaded in a fixture and one empty fixture.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.945" offset="21383189">And of course anyone -- anyone can see that the return trip with the empty fixtures is not what we ordinarily call deadhead.</text>

            <text syncTime="5594.825" offset="22482631">That is whether it's a contract carrier or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.153" offset="22492035">His answer was, “Yes, it did, because we recognized that the contact carrier can dedicate equipment to our service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.258" offset="22520456">The type of equipment that we want and we feel that on this type of transportation, it is the best thing to have the equipment solely dedicated to our use.”</text>

            <text syncTime="5658.880" offset="22738944">He said, “Normally, in manufacturing airplane parts, there are many, many engineering change that must go into each unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.845" offset="22770709">As these engineering changes are incorporated, they have to lock them out so far down the line, and if you have a longer transit time, it takes you that much longer to get to these changes in the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="5678.487" offset="22817311">In other words, these changes mean an improvement in the airplane and if we have a longer transit time, it takes us that much longer to get these changes into our aircraft that we are rolling off the production line.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.531" offset="22869452">And in response to the question, “How do you regard the J-T Transport Company in your scheme of operations?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.679" offset="22894111">His answer, “Well, we feel they are just merely a part of our production line in that we can schedule the parts right from our manufacturer and the shipments are moved right into our receiving area and through the inspection and right on into our production.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.869" offset="22958895">So they are actually just an extension of our production line.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5719.088" offset="22979688">And in response to the question, “Will you tell the examiner whether or not Boeing believes that it needs the surface here proposed in order to successfully complete its contract?”</text>

            <text syncTime="5876.797" offset="23610598">If they will dedicate equipment to every other shipper in the United States who also asks for it, they could do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.764" offset="23638392">I have no quarrel with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5888.986" offset="23659290">But as I say, I challenge that statement of the Commission and there is no basis in the record, there is no testimony except Mr. Decker's on behalf of U.S.A.C and the only thing he says in response to -- he has an affirmative answer in response to a question of counsel, “Would you station a modified trailer in Indianapolis?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.387" offset="23748942">And he said, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.940" offset="23755107">He does not say, “I will dedicate this to the exclusion of some six or seven other shippers” he bragged about having in Indianapolis and saying he was serving in order to prove his ability to perform this kind of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5926.992" offset="23811323">He never does say in this record that, “I will dedicate a piece of equipment to the use of Boeing,” in the same way that J-T says, “Here it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="6044.407" offset="24281004">Let me get back sir to my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.751" offset="24302425">I do not have very much time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.512" offset="24313396">The -- there's only one protestant here and that's U.S.A.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="6055.515" offset="24325413">I'm figuring we have the railroads and we had three or four heavy haulers who wanted to give a multiple line service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6063.369" offset="24356864">After the recommended report which recommended the granting of the application, these so-called heavy haulers were satisfied with it, realized they couldn't meet the needs and filed no exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6074.963" offset="24403257">The railroad objected to the recommended report because they said the commodity description was too great, it was for airplane parts, and they wanted -- restricted the landing gear bulkheads to which we agreed, and from that point on, we only have one protestant and that is U.S.A.C. Transport Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6093.863" offset="24478804">Now, the U.S.A.C. Transport Company were fortunate enough to secure an early certificate from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6100.143" offset="24503986">They can transport aircraft parts, untraded and traded, between all points in the United States east to the Mississippi River, and between all points in that vast area on the one hand, and all points west of the river on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="6114.173" offset="24560097">So if their mere existence is to be taken as a basis for a denial of a contract carrier application, you can see it is impossible that there ever would be any extension of any contract carrier aircraft service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6129.086" offset="24619760">Now, I think I have touched and I think I hope I have demonstrated that we have no question here about deadheading of equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6138.618" offset="24657795">That is, if U.S.A.C. was able to get this business, they could utilize some empty miles because they can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="6146.675" offset="24690082">You have to have the same number of miles in the use of the unit in each direction because one way, you haul a complete trailer load of fixtures and the other, you'll haul the fixtures with the components in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6161.269" offset="24748492">Now, Mr. Solomon in his testimony said that there were two reasons why he didn't go to U.S.A.C. One was this general dissatisfaction with prior service and he specifically gauged specific instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.886" offset="24802931">And the second was a tariff provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.149" offset="24815992">That tariff provision reads and I quote, “The determination of the equipment to be used to transport any shipment efficiently and safely shall rest exclusively with the carrier.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.243" offset="24872312">In a most unusual statement, the Commission says, “That does not mean anything.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6197.314" offset="24892583">The representative at the hearing says, “We will provide a piece of equipment and dedicate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.655" offset="24921945">Well, of course, the record does not show that he said they dedicate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6208.356" offset="24936782">And anyway, no matter what he says at the hearing, as this Court has always held and as the Commission has maintained, it's the rules in the tariff that count, that's the contract of the common carrier with his customer, and he can't bury that by anytime of an oral agreement under oath in a hearing or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="6248.401" offset="25096965">Now as I stated, the examiner, immediately after the hearing, served his recommended report, recommending the granting of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="6257.017" offset="25131447">Before the report, before that report came out, in fact, before the hearing, the Commission had granted to the applicant a temporary authority to engage in the very operation that's here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6272.258" offset="25192364">That authority was granted under Section 210 (a) which required a proof of an urgent and immediate need and a showing that there was no carrier service capable of meeting that need.</text>
            <text syncTime="6282.724" offset="25234265">The Commission granted that temporary authority over the violent objection of U.S.A.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="6287.866" offset="25254849">It's still effective by reason of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6292.008" offset="25271359">Now, here is something that you haven't heard and something that I believe is most important in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6300.202" offset="25304168">In the first Commission report which was served on January 31, 1958, the Commission, the record shows that the Commission took six printed pages in which to adopt the recommended report of the examiner to restate the facts and then to proceed to deny the application stating and I read the one paragraph, “Here is the basis for the denial of this application in the first report.”</text>

            <text syncTime="6333.371" offset="25436871">And this is the real reason why the application was denied in the second report.</text>
            <text syncTime="6340.877" offset="25466859">The Commission says, “The burden is upon the applicant seeking contract carrier authority as well as one seeking common carrier authority to establish among other things that there is a need for the service proposed which existing carriers cannot or will not need.</text>
            <text syncTime="6359.472" offset="25541256">A service not needed, cannot be found consistent with the public interest, or the National Transportation Policy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6367.538" offset="25573543">Now, following that decision, we filed a petition for reconsideration on what the full Commission was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6373.887" offset="25598934">Then we went to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6377.740" offset="25614294">We filed a suit in the same District Court at Kansas City where there was a final adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="6385.636" offset="25645955">That was on August of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="6388.723" offset="25658284">After we got the suit filed and before the answer date, the Commission came up with a decision in the so-called Leary case that is cited at Mr. Todd's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6401.270" offset="25708440">They there applied somewhat the criteria in Section 209 as we thought it should be and we thought perhaps they had finally agreed that there had been an amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6414.644" offset="25761938">And incidentally in the first report, there is not one mention of the amendments of 1957, although they have been effective for three months when that order issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="6425.850" offset="25806764">They simply ignored and decided it on the same basis that they always have.</text>
            <text syncTime="6432.462" offset="25833200">Well, after the Leary case came out and then -- it appeared that perhaps they were going to apply these standards setup in 209, we filed a successive petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6446.543" offset="25889520">That is one that is not ordinarily allowed under the rules and we filed it while the case was still in Court, much to our surprise and we were very happy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6457.064" offset="25931630">The Commission promptly issued an order setting aside and reopening the -- or issued an order reopening the proceedings for further disposition on the same record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6468.381" offset="25976874">So, we by agreement with the Interstate Commerce Commission and the other parties, we took a nonsuit without prejudice in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6478.878" offset="26018879">Then along came the second order which is the one that has been discussed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6486.476" offset="26049285">We found out of course that when we filed that successive petition, we made our first mistake, because it gave the Interstate Commerce Commission its opportunity in the second order to prepare and file its first brief in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6501.665" offset="26109994">We say that the second order is simply -- well, first, in the second order, in the head note, which the Commission prepares, it starts out and it says, “We affirm our decision in the first order.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6515.794" offset="26166523">In the second order, they specifically provide in the order itself that the first order is still valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="6524.524" offset="26201422">Now, in the second order, they are trying to explain what was so clear and cogently stated on -- in the first order that the reason why the application was denied was because there was an existing carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="6723.605" offset="26997844">Now, I can well understand that the Commission in beginning to consider criteria three, that is the effect of the granting of the application upon the services and that's an important word, of protesting carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6744.590" offset="27081749">They first have to determine that there was a carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="6837.932" offset="27455091">So, and the reason why the shipper wanted that was because of economic reasons and his distribution reasons.</text>
