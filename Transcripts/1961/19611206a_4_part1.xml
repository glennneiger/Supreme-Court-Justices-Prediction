            <label>Mr. Arthur H. Dean</label>
            <text syncTime="66.106" offset="367783">The judgment of the lower court was that the acquisition by Brown of Kinney violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act as was amended in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.512" offset="441448">Section 7, as the Court is well aware provides that if as a result of any acquisition and any line of commerce, in any section of the country or the effect maybe to substantially lessen competition depends -- the acquisition is in violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.426" offset="557119">We believe that the District Court was in error in regard to the lines of commerce, it selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.462" offset="597243">The sections of the country it concluded existed in shoe retailing and it's appraisal of the effect of the acquisition upon the lessening of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.554" offset="657638">I would like first to describe to the Court the operations of the two firms and the type of business in which each of them were engaged, the results on competition as set forth in the evidence and then go to the -- what the District Court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.617" offset="757844">Some of you who -- many years ago who read funny papers may recall Buster Brown and his dog Tige.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.142" offset="791907">This was for many years, the trademark of the Brown Shoe Company, although the company itself has founded under the name of Brown in 1878.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.849" offset="838719">The -- most of the evidence, most of the -- of the statistical evidence in the record is for the fiscal year ending October 31, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.209" offset="888247">In that year, the Brown Shoe Company produced some 25,600,000 pairs of shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.154" offset="935999">The national production was 642,507,000 so that Brown had roughly 4% of the national production in pairs of shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.447" offset="989184">For that period, it was the fourth largest manufacturer in the United States in leather shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.824" offset="1018650">As the Court will see as I go on I am going to draw some of distinction between leather shoes and rubber soled upper -- where the uppers are made of canvass which is also a very fast growing part of the shoe business.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.406" offset="1093047">The Kinney Company, the company that was acquired by Brown in this period ending in 1955 produced 2.9 million pairs out of the 642 odd million pairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.989" offset="1159293">In other words, the Kinney Company had four-tenths of 1% of the national production of shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.646" offset="1206000">So that together, as far as the production of leather shoe is concerned, after the acquisition, Brown and Kinney produced 4.4% of the national production.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.619" offset="1269844">The District Court conceded that as far as the manufacturing, effects on competition of the manufacturing was concerned, it was only slight and I believe that the Government in its brief has conceded that the effect on competition as far as production is concerned is very slight.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.908" offset="1374960">Let me turn now to -- to go from the production of shoes to the shoe retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.076" offset="1419682">Brown has been, for many years, primarily a manufacturer of shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.768" offset="1454477">Starting some time in this country before -- after the turn of the century, there began to be experienced by local merchants, a competition in various cities of the so-called chain store.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.852" offset="1534830">So that the big function of the chain store as far as the consumer is concerned is to try it to give a good quality merchandise, not necessarily at least in the merchandising field, but the highest quality, in tremendous volume could cut out the wholesaler, cut out the jobber, could cut out the middleman to try to carry on his -- the business at a very low rate of profit per unit of sale and to try to pass these benefits on to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.459" offset="1717164">Brown had built up its manufacturing business in the medium price field, which I will tell you in dollar terms in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.763" offset="1766379">They bought the highest grade materials in every respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.677" offset="1790098">They taught their workman to produce the highest quality shoes in every respect and they advertised their shoes under national brand names in national magazines and they sold and still continue to sell the bulk of their production through some 7000 independent dealers to whom they sell these shoes at wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.639" offset="1909948">Now Brown has endeavored to help all of these 7000 independent dealers to compete with the so-called retail chains by advising them with respect to their inventories, their methods of merchandising, their methods of stocking shoes, their methods of advertising and their methods of pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.693" offset="2018095">They have tried to bring to these 7000 independent local retail dealers by advising them how to compete with these retail shoe chains.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.347" offset="2080789">Now the most successful of the retail shoe chains are not integrated with any manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.393" offset="2112972">The three largest and most successful, the Sears Roebuck in its retail store, it also sells shoes by mail order but in in its retail stores, shoes -- Sears does not own any manufacturing facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.518" offset="2181413">The second largest is Edison Brothers, again, does not own any manufacturing facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.578" offset="2209729">J.C. Penney then there are very large -- the largest outlet west to the Mississippi is in the Famous Bar and store in St. Louis, again, it does not own manufacturing facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.865" offset="2266781">Then there are great outlets in New York, in Macy's and Marshall, Chicago, Marshall Field and other leading department stores, but the most successful of the chain stores selling at retail are not themselves integrated with the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.963" offset="2343267">Brown found that it could not sell its manufactured shoes where it used only the best quality materials and tried to have only the best quality workmanship because the chains wanted to sell their own brand of shoes and they weren't interested in the national brands and they also wanted to sell shoes at a price so that the -- these big retail chains buy their shoes made up to their own specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.326" offset="2484642">They select the materials, select the workmanship and buy these shoes to sell at a price.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.719" offset="2514213">Now in order to help some of these 7 odd thousand independent dealers to whom Brown sold in an effort to help these independent merchants compete better with these retail chains, Brown set up the so-called, “Brown franchise plan.”</text>
            <text syncTime="624.184" offset="2600103">Now, each of the people operating on this Brown franchise plan are completely independent dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.224" offset="2624240">They have their own capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.039" offset="2635525">They select their own store.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.248" offset="2644407">They hire their own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.473" offset="2653288">They buy their own stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.456" offset="2661230">They handle their own merchandiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.224" offset="2672306">They run these stores entirely for their own account, for their own profit and loss account.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.317" offset="2700622">What Brown does is to send out experts in order to help these people in the display of shoes in the window, in the layout of the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.423" offset="2753076">They teach these independent retailers that in order to compete with the retail chains that you've got to render service and that you have to lay in a complete stock in-depth of each style of shoe and you have to be able to sell the customer in each size and in each width.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.630" offset="2853909">One of the ways that some of the chains are able to cut down on their operating expenses is that they don't stock 12 months out of a year all shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.998" offset="2899362">They buy these shoes from these manufacturers to meet their specifications and some of the chains only stocked shoes in the most popular sizes or they may stock them only in two widths whereas Brown tries to teach its dealers that the way to compete is to have a stock of each style in-depth, in each size and in its width and to pay attention to the fitting and the comfort --</text>

            <text syncTime="743.739" offset="3078353">These -- there are some 11,000 manufacturers of shoes in the United States Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.689" offset="3110118">And some of these people on contract supply shoes to these retail chain stores according to their specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.664" offset="3162049">These -- most of these retail chain stores sell this out, as I come to you in a minute and give you the dollar prices, selling what's called the popular price field.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.000" offset="3199352">Most of the independent retailers to whom Brown sells, sell in a price above the popular price field and what's called the medium price fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.916" offset="3247000">There's about -- at various community here, there's about 10% to 15% of Brown's business which has not been profitable for it where it make shoes to specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.070" offset="3295692">And I think that to that where they make shoes to specifications, those shoes come at competition on a manufacturing level where the shoes are sold to these retail chains.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.098" offset="3335816">It is our contention as I shall try to develop that the shoes -- that Brown manufactures and sells to these independent dealers in this medium price range are not in competition with the shoes in the popular price range which is ranging almost entirely in which Kinney, the company that Brown acquired sold.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.661" offset="3986056">I might just say Mr. Justice Frankfurter that the number -- the evidence is somewhat varying in the record as to the actual number of shoe manufacturers in the United States, the United States shoe manufacturing company which is you know leases shoe (Inaudible), testified that it had about a thousand customers on its account.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.390" offset="4680913">Now, Brown retails it shoes in -- in three other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.943" offset="4715186">In order to help young men, young men who'd been generally speaking, the assistant managers or managers in other stores who want to start out on their own, Brown through its wholly own subsidiary, the Wohl, it's W-A -- W-O-H-L Shoe Company has the so-called Wohl Plan and there a young man who has from $30,000 can open up a shoe store and Brown will set him those shoes on consignment and he remits after he takes out his salary, the proceeds of those shoes sold after expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.057" offset="4907551">That constitutes about 2% of Brown's wholesale sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.113" offset="4939839">That's called the Wohl Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.085" offset="4959692">Those shoes are sold at wholesale to this young man starting out in business as independent dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.630" offset="4993860">Now, in addition, the Wohl Shoe Company and this is a fairly common thing in the merchandising of shoes in department stores, many department stores find that the merchandising of shoes is a very complicated business and they lease their shoe departments so that they're not operated by the store itself and Wohl operates 100 departments and some 163 independent department and specialty stores throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.280" offset="5152475">The -- in these department stores or Wohl generally speaking has no written agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.434" offset="5181106">They are cancellable at anytime by the department store owner and the merchandising policy has to conform to the department store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.791" offset="5218513">In these leased departments, Wohl concentrates on women's shoes and generally in both the medium price line and in lines higher than the medium price line, that is higher than $14.95.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.513" offset="5277445">Some of the shoes sold by Wohl in these leased departments grow up as highest $25 -- $32.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.178" offset="5316106">In addition Wohl itself operates some 18 family shoe stores and nine women's shoe stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.849" offset="5358738">Brown has one other subsidiary the Regal Shoe Company which both manufactures shoes as plan as equipment Massachusetts and has a retail store mostly on the eastern seaboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.472" offset="5421223">These two subsidiaries, the Wohl Shoe Company and the Regal Shoe Company, both subsidiary of Brown, together sold about 1.1% of the $37 million combined sales of shoe -- of footwear sold at retail in this year 1955 out of $3,464,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.038" offset="5523519">Now let me turn from a moment to Kinney, the company that was acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.604" offset="5549746">Kinney was primarily a retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.943" offset="5567195">It did some manufacturing, but its manufacturing was not very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.659" offset="5594049">Kinney was one of the oldest of the so-called integrated manufacturing and retail shoe stores and in 1929 to 1930, it got into great financial difficulties because as I shall develop later, it is quite impossible for a manager of a shoe store, especially a shoe store selling women's shoes which are -- where the styles change very rapidly and where you have to be completely au courant of what perhaps may be the latest style of shoe worn and the latest texture by the most prominent star, apparently manufacturing part of Kinney is trying to force on the retail stores the shoes that they manufacture and they almost went bankrupt in trying to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.834" offset="5818702">As a result, Kinney decreased the emphasis on manufacturing and tried to build up generally in family areas and generally in the very low price field lower than this medium field in which the Brown sells and they developed stores in some 315 cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.756" offset="5930402">Now, Kinney is a family shoe store, by that I mean it caters to all members of the family and pairs it sold in 1955 in children shoes 51%, in women's shoes 35%, and in men 40%, in other words it has sold in that year about 1.2% of the national retail footwear sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.899" offset="6038967">As I had just said Wohl and Regal sold about 1.1, sold at retail, Brown and Kinney sold together about 2.3% of the national footwear retail sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.679" offset="6106049">Now, I want to be clear that the lower court found that these Brown franchise dealers, some 635 out of the 7000 independent dealers, all he found that they used their own capital and -- and run these stores for their own profit and loss, nevertheless, in his finding to which we take exception, he included the retail sales of these Brown franchise dealers and these wholesale sales on this Wohl Plan account, he included those as though they were actually retail outlets of Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.750" offset="6294340">Now, from a competitive standpoint, they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.261" offset="6308446">One of the great advantages of companies like Edison Brothers, one of the most successful of women's retail chains is that they separate their stores into three classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.690" offset="6354108">But if they find that sales are depressed in one area because of economic conditions, they can move shoes from say Philadelphia to Washington or Washington to Boston or Boston to Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.945" offset="6407189">You cannot do that with these independent dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.636" offset="6417951">Each of these independent dealers buy themselves as he pleases with his own capital at his own profit and loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.288" offset="6444492">So we believe and I think the economic evidence supports us that the retail sales of these independent dealers should not be regarded as retail sales to Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.105" offset="6499767">They also think that to do so, completely distorts the economic evidence because otherwise the wholesale sale of Brown to these independent dealers is included and then the retail sales are included so -- and then the factory sales will be included twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.742" offset="6582314">These sales, combined sales of Wohl and Regal would be $78 million out of 3.5 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.721" offset="6642291">As I said, Brown started primarily as a manufacturer, it sold to these independent retailers in this medium price range which the men's were $8.95 to $14.95, women's $7.95 to $14.95 and children's $5.45 to $7.95 and they tried it every way to help these sales to independent dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.224" offset="6760260">Now, there is no difference in the terms on which Brown's sales are made to these 7000 independent dealers and those on the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.313" offset="6800593">Those on the franchise get no better credit terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.421" offset="6813027">They got no greater discounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.502" offset="6821386">They get no greater payrolls than any independent dealer buying from Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.544" offset="6845524">There is at one time, Brown tried to organize a group life insurance for some of these franchise dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.752" offset="6894425">And I think about 400 of the 635 still have it, although there is no evidence in the record because of the vast extension of group life to whether its -- practically any organization has it today that there's any benefit in having it and then in the Wohl Plan, these -- the insurance features of the Wohl Plan were cancelled because they couldn't prove any economic benefit to dealer, either from the group life or the fire insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.268" offset="7044472">Brown is, as a retailer, through its Wohl subsidiary, sells 80% of women's shoes, and sells men's shoes through its Regal subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.902" offset="7111032">The Regal subsidiary has never been profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.659" offset="7137991">In contrast to the Brown independent dealers, selling these nationally advertised branded shoes, so when the customer comes in, he having had a pair, being satisfied with them, he asks for that pair of shoes which he's had before and which he knows by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.168" offset="7220015">In the Kinney outlets, they do not have any national advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.246" offset="7248332">They do not sell national brands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.971" offset="7267244">In contrast to the -- to the Wohl's operations in leased departments where there are charge accounts, where there is delivery, where there's a liberal plan of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.249" offset="7316355">In the Kinney retail outlets, it's entirely cash and carry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.098" offset="7335790">There is little service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.671" offset="7350105">The shoes are carried generally only in the popular sizes and then only in two widths.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.469" offset="7389288">They're the popular or low priced family shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.943" offset="7411127">For the men shoes, I say again, they're $8.99 and down, for the women's $5.99 and down and children's $3.99 and down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.281" offset="7460446">80% of the shoes sold in the Kinney retail stores are made by independent manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.243" offset="7512377">Starting about, shortly after the end of World War II I'm sure the Court is aware, there was a great trend from the cities where many of the shoe store outlets were located to in the suburbs and about this same time with the passage of the 40-hour week law banks and a great many business establishments closed their offices on Saturdays.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.054" offset="7655633">Prior to that time there was a very common occurrence or families, the wife and the children to come in and have lunch with the husband on Saturday and do the shopping in the downtown city areas on a Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.038" offset="7719476">With this great access to the suburbs with this 40-hour a week, the husband no longer in many instances comes in to town on a Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.678" offset="7750092">As a result, there has grown up in the United States several types of shopping centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.113" offset="7787813">Some of these shopping centers are very vast, they're very large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.931" offset="7803068">They have free parking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.633" offset="7809860">You can get practically anything from medical service or dental service or optical service or clothes to shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.566" offset="7845595">Others are -- are neighbor -- neighbor parking centers within three or four minutes driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.977" offset="7875271">These centers have revolutionized the merchandising of shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.353" offset="7912782">The shoe store that Brown had near the stock exchange that used to do several hundred thousand dollars worth the business per annum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.297" offset="7948518">With the stock exchange and banks and offices closed, they were doing practically nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.284" offset="7972551">So that Kinney went -- decided to try to go out and get locations in these suburban shopping centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.028" offset="8019466">They also have built what's called free standing stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.412" offset="8037021">There is one, a Kinney store, Northeast of Washington in Rockville, Maryland where they build these stores right out on the highways, but no buildings on either side as parking lot and where you can -- put your shoes out on the racks and the customer selects the shoes and the clerk just fits them and wraps them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.073" offset="8127613">So Kinney started in on this -- trying to get these outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.967" offset="8159274">In order to get these outlets, you have to contract for them several years ahead because the insurance companies make the loans to the buildings and they want a lease signed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.291" offset="8216534">Kinney didn't have the necessary capital because of some restrictions in the step financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.908" offset="8247045">The common stock was owned by a relatively small group who wanted no more common sold and Brown, which did not previously had any outlets in this lower price field and which was becoming concerned about whether there could be a re-urbanization of the urban centers, felt that these retail outlets, especially on these suburban centers offered a possibility of going in to this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.764" offset="8398451">Now let me be clear Brown did not think that it was going to sell any of the shoes that it manufactured to Kinney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.514" offset="8437426">Now, the reason for that is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.041" offset="8455502">Once you have trained your work to do -- use the best possible workmanship as the evidence shows Brown does and once you have graduated, a workman to hire quality workmanship, smaller stickers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.356" offset="8528750">They get paid more as they go up in the quality of their work and the wages go up, it is almost impossible to teach a workman whom you've trained for several years to do the best quality of workmanship, to do medium quality of workmanship and also it means that he lowers his pay so that in a few times that Brown and its like business carriers has tried to take orders for the manufacturing of a lower price shoe, not with the brand name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.989" offset="8671378">It -- have they have not been profitable, they have had difficulty with their workmen and Brown now knows that it is utterly possible for it to manufacture in its factories a kind of shoe which Kinney can have manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.684" offset="8742118">Now there is an almost constant entry into the shoe manufacturing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.674" offset="8770017">You can lease your equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.780" offset="8782451">You can get contracts from this retail chains who don't have manufacturing facilities of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.833" offset="8810663">There are many communities which will build you or give you a factory, tax free for some period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.272" offset="8844413">There is a great ease of entry into the shoe manufacturing business and therefore, Kinney wants to be free in its retailer, that's to be able to buy where -- were it leases, whatever styles it wants and at whatever prices economic conditions might make necessary at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.562" offset="8941589">So that there is no possibility I believe on an economic standpoint, any feasible economic standpoint of Brown being able to increase its sales of manufactured shoes to Kinney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.771" offset="9010448">That was not the intent of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.088" offset="9019747">It's economic -- not the economic purpose of the merger and I think the economic evidence will clearly show that that cannot come about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.674" offset="9062066">Now, there had been some small sales of Brown to Kinney, but on the other hand, the sales of Kinney from outside people have increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.784" offset="9106474">There wasn't a single witness who testified that he believed that he -- a single manufacturer who testified that he believed that he would be displaced as a supplier of Kinney by Brown, not a single one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.500" offset="9173347">There isn't -- there isn't one word of evidence in the entire record from anyone indicating any possibility that the present suppliers of Kinney or the suppliers of Kinney in the future will be displaced by Brown.</text>

            <text syncTime="2600.365" offset="10504861">The Court disregarded all of that testimony and held that every retail outlet was in competition with every other retail outlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.873" offset="10538820">He disregarded style, price, quality or type of merchandise and he simply divided all shoes into three classes, men's shoes women's shoes and children's shoes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2644.616" offset="10681866">He lumped in to this -- there's half a dozen categories in boy's shoes, youth shoes, growing girl's shoes, miss' shoes and the shoe trade that are well-recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.359" offset="10724812">He threw those all apparently in the children's shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.942" offset="10743097">He completely disregarded all of the economic testimony with respect to the fact that people rarely go out of the price range.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.306" offset="10784580">He -- we also and we believe the economic evidence supports us in this that in determining your line of commerce that you have to determine it realistically on the basis of the purpose for which a person is going to buy a shoe at the time he purchases it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.001" offset="10867336">He disregarded that because he said a person could one day buy a shoe as a dress shoe and several years later after it was worn out it might be used for gardening, but we submit that on the evidence and from a standpoint of determining what is proper competition that you have to determine the use as between the two types of shoes as of the time of purchase and not what you're going to do with it when you wear it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.001" offset="10999411">He therefore disregarded all of the -- of the different classes of shoes which are very common and well-standardized and well-understood in shoe retailing and which are fundamental part of shoe retailing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.874" offset="12354853">In 1947, they were 1077.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.592" offset="12373765">In 1954, they were 970 and in 1958, there were 872, but there has been an increase of well over -- from 506,000,000 pairs in 1947 to 643,000,000 pairs in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.156" offset="12452028">From 1939 through 1956, the production share of the largest four has been constant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.262" offset="12480449">It's been 23.2%, that's in a table in our main brief at page 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.155" offset="12512005">Now, the share of the next largest (Inaudible) above the four to the largest 45 have declined, but the shares of the smaller manufacturers above these eight to -- up to the largest 50 have increased by 5.8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.692" offset="12598105">Now the Court seemed to feel -- the lower court seemed to feel that there was an inexorable trend towards mergers or inexorable trend towards manufacturers acquiring retail outlets, but the evidence is quite contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.799" offset="12674591">Furthermore, if you would take into consideration the growth in canvass-upper rubber soled shoes which has increased from 24 million pairs in 1947 to 125 million pairs in 1961, the four largest shares would be way down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.139" offset="12791933">Now, there'd been various shifts within these groups but within the first four, their aggregate has been about 23.2 and Brown has changed from 3.86 to 3.99.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.202" offset="12868211">Now, there has been a great -- on this question of ease of entry there were two companies that entered the shoe manufacturing business for the first time in 1940, the Sudbury Company which has become the ninth largest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.759" offset="12938428">They started in 1940 and today they're ninth largest and the Georgia which started in 1940 and is today the 25th largest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.794" offset="12982523">Now, there is no economy or manufacturer in these -- in these large factories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.701" offset="13018154">Some of the companies including Brown set up factories of 20,000 a day and they found that they had to go back to more medium sized establishments that they were more efficient and that again is something that makes free of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.666" offset="13094013">You can lease your machinery and there are no patents or technological barriers and there really isn't a competitive production challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.610" offset="13137795">There's also been an enormous increase in shoe imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.942" offset="13159111">Some -- from 1954 of 6 million they've gone in 1960 to 121 million in pairs, from $10 million to 115 millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.319" offset="13220655">And this question of the -- that seemed to concern the court so much below that the independent retailer would not be able to compete with the retail outlets owned by manufacturers, our brief shows on that table 23, that -- that type of distribution is only 7% in dollars and 5% in pairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.767" offset="13330474">Now, there are some 70,000 outlets -- shoe outlets in retail in the United States, some 70,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.097" offset="13359731">You'll find through the testimony the figure 22,000 shoe stores that's because in the census, they only include for statistical purposes a shoe store something which has over 50% of its sales in shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.626" offset="13437889">As I said earlier, the big retailers of Sears with $104 million, Edison Brothers with 87, and Penney with 85 and Montgomery (Inaudible) at 41, are retail chains but they don't have manufacturing facilities and the department stores again which don't have manufacturing facilities sell 11% and these independent stores, the independent retailers still sell about 49% of the shoes sold in the United States at retail so that no single shoe retailer has any large share of the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.386" offset="13880926">And it has strived to help the vast bulk of the independent retailers who buy from it at wholesale to continue to sell this type of shoe to the American public in competition with these chain stores who can buy from any manufacturer at a price or any style or by a certain number so that I think it's -- as far as the styling is concerned and as far as the vast amount of the merchandising it is concerned, I think it is these chain retail stores without manufacturing connections who probably set the style.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="4562.069" offset="18351626">That would be our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.375" offset="18364897">In this case if it please the Court, the Brown Shoe Company, a third or fourth depending of the measure, largest shoe manufacturer in the country and the major factor in the retail markets because of -- on their controlled outlets has bought up the nation's largest independent chain of the retail shoe stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.430" offset="18453086">For many years, the shoe industry was characterized by small manufacturers and by small independent retailers and by a very great number of each, so that one had a condition approaching very closely to the economist's classical free market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.596" offset="18525706">In recent years, as the District Court found, a trend toward concentration set in, so it is now a danger at both the wholesale or manufacturer sales level and also at retail level that the former classical free market will give way to a condition of oligopoly such as we associate with autos, rubber, some electrical products and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.626" offset="18629883">The trend toward domination by the large companies encompasses three developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.695" offset="18654124">First, the big manufactures are beginning to get more factories at a larger share of the factories.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.829" offset="18682650">The large chains are beginning to dominate retail and growing and the big manufactures are now acquiring in increasing numbers, the big chains of retail stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.506" offset="18733432">The process had not gone so far up to the time of this merger that the statistics showing the trends towards concentration are very startling in combination contrast to the auto industry or steel or the like, but the facts found by the District Court make it plan that the trend is all to evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.634" offset="18809919">In practical terms therefore, we think that the basic issue before the Court in this case is whether the essential character of the shoe industry, as it had been, will be preserved or the dominant firms like Brown will be allowed to lead it through mergers down the road to domination by biggies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.266" offset="18892466">In legal terms, the question arises under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.297" offset="18912528">It prohibits one business firm from acquiring the stock or assets of another when the effect in any line of commerce, in any section of the country maybe substantially to lessen competition. So here the ultimate question of course is whether under the circumstances of this industry, it may substantially lessen competition in any line of commerce, in any section of the country for the third or fourth largest manufacturer and the largest important chain of retail stores to be combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.580" offset="19057664">We think that Brown's acquisition of Kinney's assets violates Section 7 for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.391" offset="19088906">First, the vertical combination of Brown's manufacturing facilities with Kinney's outlets deprives other manufacturers of a fair opportunity to compete for Kinney's purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.539" offset="19141569">This aspect to the merger in principal that is as to the kind of thing leaving the quantitative question aside is no different of course between -- from the DuPont-General Motors case where you have a supplier and the outlets being combined and therefore creating a tendency to foreclose other suppliers from selling in those companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="5358.827" offset="21538670">In other words, we think that the merger of the fourth largest manufacturer, with a largest retail chain plus the combination of their retail outlet will so increase the relative size of the enterprise as to give it a decisive advantage over small competitor, thus concentrating undue economic power in violating Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.221" offset="21632293">Under this head I think, again the only serious question although others are raised is the question of substantiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.144" offset="21671999">Each of these three central propositions is incorporated in the ultimate findings and conclusions of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.156" offset="21708048">Each of those ultimate findings and conclusions rest upon subsidiary area findings effect and there we think in turn are supported by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.720" offset="21746291">As I said earlier, the evidence comes chiefly from live witnesses and is therefore of a character which -- on which the District Court's finding are entitled to decisive weight unless clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.126" offset="21807835">Now, I tend to develop my argument under the three main heads, and to deal with the question line of commerce section of the country when I come to it under each of those three main heads because then we talk about it not in the abstract but were denied to the purpose or function of the concept in the development of the law and the decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.531" offset="21909504">Before I come to developing those three propositions however, it seemed appropriate to me since this was the first major case to come before the Court under Section 7 of the Clayton Act to say something about the meaning of that Section and its legislative history so that there maybe a legal background against which to appraise these quite complicated and detailed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.283" offset="22020472">It its original form as enacted in 1914, Section 7 of the Clayton Act, you'll recall, prohibited corporation from acquiring a whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of two or more corporations where the effect of such acquisition maybe to substantially lessen competition between such corporations, then it went on with other provisions not relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.747" offset="22126320">The legislative history of the original Section 7 makes it quite plain that Congress thought -- sought even then to halt the trend toward concentration by preventing mergers that might substantially lessen competition, even though the degree of market control resulting did not reach such a stage that there would be a violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.667" offset="22230079">The aim as it was stated at the time was to check restraints of competition in their incipiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.903" offset="22259022">As matters developed, Section 7 had three short comings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.107" offset="22275845">First, it did not reach corporate mergers like this one which were accomplished through the acquisition of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.911" offset="22303013">Second, since Section 7 prohibited one corporation from acquiring stock to the second corporation where the effect of such acquisition maybe to substantially lessen competition between such corporations, it was widely but erroneously assumed that Section 7 did not apply to vertical combinations, but only apply it to a combination between competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.643" offset="22405935">Third, this in terms very strict prohibitions against stock acquisition where the effect of such acquisition might be to lessen competition between the competer -- competitors between the acquiring and acquired corporations was so strict that there was a tendency to read into it limitations similar to those applied in interpreting the Sherman Act, notions of market control or unreasonable restraints or restraints in consistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.478" offset="22557236">World War II set off a new wave of corporate mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5619.590" offset="22581687">Economists, I think I should say are still debating their true impact, but it's quite plan that they gave the Federal Trade Commission and the Congress very grave concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="5631.252" offset="22628394">That concern led directly to the amendment of Section 7 in an effort to halt economic concentration and to preserve the opportunities of small businessmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.178" offset="22672071">The effort came to a climax when Section 7 was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="5647.344" offset="22692760">More particularly, the amendments read against the committee reports and the legislative debate had two main general purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.289" offset="22740511">First, many American industries had even then have been transformed by the emergence of a handful of dominant firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.559" offset="22777605">In those industries, the markets no longer were free at least in the sense of the classical economist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.691" offset="22806131">They were dominant -- there was -- they characterized by price leadership by large dominant firms and either by an absence of opportunities by small -- for small businessmen or by a small businessman who operated under the shelter of the umbrella of the large firms as long as they kept their proper place in the hierarchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.052" offset="22895574">In other industries, notably in textiles, apparel, and some branches of food and the like, the older classical condition, the ideal of small business continued to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.994" offset="22951372">Now, Section 7 quite clearly was intended to do what Congress could to preserve the latter condition in those industries where it still existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.891" offset="22994944">Thus the Senate Committee said then I think that it's worth imposing a quotation upon the Court, the type of problem to which the bill was addressed was described by the Federal Trade Commission in these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="5736.469" offset="23049279">“Where several large enterprises are extending their power by successive small acquisitions, accumulative effect of their purchases maybe to convert an industry from one of intense competition about many enterprises to one in which three or four large concerns produced the entire supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5756.016" offset="23127437">This latter pattern, which economists called oligopoly, is likely to be characterized by avoidance of price competition and by respect on the part of each concern for the vested interest of its rival.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.720" offset="23178219">In district remember, is what the Committee said was the type of problem to which the bill was directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.423" offset="23205073">And I may say, it seems to us to be the very type of small acquisition that has taken place in this industry, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5786.707" offset="23250213">Second, it should be emphasized that Congress was not motivated solely by considerations of economic efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.135" offset="23283963">It was moved by a social philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5797.870" offset="23294830">It was distressed that the small businesses and small industries were being forced under, were being wiped out by mergers, that the little fellow no longer had the opportunity he had once had in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.726" offset="23350314">Judge Pope stated the point very effectively in the Crown Zellerbach case in the Ninth Circuit a few months ago, “As the legislation was under consideration by Congress, it was duly appreciated that decentralized and deconcentrated markets are often uneconomic and provide higher cost and prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="5832.864" offset="23434846">All this it -- it, meaning Congress laid aside in its concern over the Curse of Bigness and the concentration of power, the nation's market which Congress thought advantaged the big man and disadvantaged the little one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.148" offset="23499943">To achieve these two broad purposes partly economic and partly social, Congress made three changes in Section 7 which corrected the three inadequacies or omissions that I pointed out earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5865.483" offset="23565354">In the first place Section 7 was explicitly extended to cover acquisition of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.247" offset="23592312">Second, it was made applicable to vertical combinations by eliminating the requirement that the acquisition be shown to substantially lessen competition between the acquired and the acquiring firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.647" offset="23645915">Instead, Section 7 now pro -- now prohibits acquisitions whereas I said before in any line of commerce, at any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition maybe to substantially lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5901.232" offset="23708296">It doesn't say between whom, just competition in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5905.885" offset="23726895">The effect of the latter change as Congress fully realized was to eliminate any possibility that the Sherman Act rule of reasoning or notions of market control or market dominance would apply under Section 7 that the aim was to eliminate any chance if that would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.059" offset="23799620">Here again, the Senate Committee report and the House Committee report make this indisputably clear, “by eliminating the provisions of the existing section, which would appear to read situations of little economic significance, it is the purpose of this legislation to ensure a broader construction of the more fundamental provisions that are retained that has been given in the past.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5948.811" offset="23898572">The intent here as in other parts of the Clayton Act is to cope with monopolistic tendencies in their incipiency and well before they have attained such effects as would justify a Sherman Act proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="5986.326" offset="24048724">It was also quite clearly addressed to the elimination of the requirement that to be -- or rather I should say to the pro -- to the proscription of all mergers which would substantially lessen competition between the acquired and the acquiring firm but as you see, would prohibit practically any merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="6006.827" offset="24130644">And Congress, it wasn't really -- the Courts to get over that had begun to read qualifications in it and it's quite clear that the aim was to get rid of those qualifications by setting up not quite so strict a test but one which was not as strict as the test of the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="6189.584" offset="24861759">Thus far -- thus far Your Honor, it hasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.760" offset="24874402">The Courts -- short of this Court could have considered it reading these change in the light of the previous judicial interpretation of Section 7 and the Committee reports and the natural meaning of words of the amended statutes have precluded that it does lay down a stricter test one falling far short of the -- one far more strict than that which would be imposed under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.352" offset="24988818">Now, there's another but I'll proceed to another point which I think bears on this so far as the exact words go Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.313" offset="25024658">There is -- there are two farther points that the legislative history makes clear and the first of them at least bears directly on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6237.754" offset="25054438">It wasn't chance that Congress used the words where the effect may be to substantially lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6245.020" offset="25083486">Section 3 of course had long prohibited, tying clauses and requirements contract where the effect in the same words except that the infinitive split where the effect maybe to substantially lessen competition and a clause had a very -- just before the 1950 Amendment had been written on those words in the Standard Service Station case at 337 U.S. where the Court specifically refused to embark on the kind of broad economic inquiry that would be pertinent under the rule of reason under the Sherman Act referring to the Chicago Board of Trade case, and said that the sole question was whether the qualifying clause of Section 3 and it held that the qualifying clause of Section 3 is satisfied by proof that competition has been foreclosed in a substantial share of the line of commerce effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.284" offset="25328515">And so here, it seems plain to us that when Congress used to very words that had -- had that clause put upon them in Section 3, only a year or two before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6319.961" offset="25383267">And when Congress stated that Section 7, the new language of Section 7 was intended to be given an interpretation similar to those which the courts would apply in interpreting the same language in other sections of the Clayton Act that it must have meant to interpret the attitude or gloss that had been written on those words in the Standard Stations case, and that essentially is the meaning that we claim that should have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6354.039" offset="25519522">The one further point in the legislative history, it does show with unusual specificity I think the kinds of mergers which would have the unwanted effect upon the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6369.179" offset="25580126">The Committee listed three, I won't read the passage, but which are particularly applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6377.162" offset="25611995">First, it spoke of combinations which establish relationships between buyers and sellers, which deprived the rivals of a fair opportunity to compete and of course, that is a reference to the kind of vertical integration that we have in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6396.263" offset="25688377">Second, it spoke of eliminating activity which had previously been a substantial factor in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6403.819" offset="25718680">We think that eliminating Kinney as an independent concern in the retail markets eliminates as we shall show what was a substantial factor in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6415.416" offset="25765073">And third, Congress made it very clear that it was concerned about increases in the size of an enterprise, making the acquisition to such a point that its advantage over its competitors threatens to become decisive and that is exactly what the District Court found in virtually those words was happening as a result of this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="6440.175" offset="25864025">I turn first then to the effect of the merger of Brown and Kinney, judged vertically its effect in the manufacturers' market where we submit that the result of combining the third or fourth largest manufacturer with the largest independent retail chain will be to substantially lessen competition in the manufacturers nationwide markets for men's, women's and children's shoes.</text>
