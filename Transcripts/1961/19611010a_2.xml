            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Number 19, Robert F.Kennedy, Attorney General of the United States, Appellant, versus Francisco Mendoza-Martinez.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.941" offset="157194">Mr. Davis, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="15.413" offset="167121">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.970" offset="177256">This case is here on direct appeal from a judgment of the Southern District of California under 28 United States Code 1252 and it's here on direct appeal because that Court held invalid a statute of Congress, Section 401 (j) of the Nationality Act of 1940, providing that person subject to the draft who leave the country for the purpose of evading draft are expatriated, lose their nationality and Section 1252 provides for direct appeal to this Court from the judgment of any court of the United States holding invalid a statute of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.729" offset="348306">As the Court will no doubt recall, the case has been here twice before at the October term, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.773" offset="384564">The case was remanded after the decisions in the Perez and Trop cases relating to expatriation for foreign voting and expatriation for desertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.586" offset="427719">At that time, the District Court held the statute unconstitutional and it was again appealed by the Government directly to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.033" offset="461573">After the argument of the case, the Court sua sponte, found in the record a lurking question of collateral estoppel which it thought beclouded the record and it remanded the case to the District Court with permission to the parties to amend the pleadings to raise that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.731" offset="536388">And the case was so remanded and as I shall stand in a min -- state in a minute, that issue was resolved adversely to the appellee by the District Court and the District Court again held the statute unconstitutional and the Government again brought the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.132" offset="605978">Now, in this posture of the case, there are two issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.578" offset="623741">One is the non-constitutional issue on which the Court remanded the case the last time.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.844" offset="644848">That is the issue of collateral estoppel because Mendoza-Martinez, the appellee had been convicted of draft evasion in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.952" offset="681211">And the question is, whether that conviction for draft evasion in 1947 collaterally estops the Government in this case from claiming that he lost his citizenship as a result of Section 401 (j) of the Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.055" offset="745681">And the other question is the same question which has been twice here before that is the validity of the statute itself and that issue in and of itself comes here unencumbered by any dispute as to the facts because the facts had been stipulated below both on the prior occasions and on this occasion and Mendoza-Martinez has agreed that he did leave the country and remain abroad for the purpose of evading the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.354" offset="862814">I should state at the outset for a moment that there follows this Number 20, a Court case which has a relationship to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.431" offset="895101">In that, there was presented in that case the constitutionality of the successor provision in the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.096" offset="925821">This case arises under the 1940 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.726" offset="936375">The successor provision, as I will try to point out in that case, is in the respect pertinent here is the same as Section 401 (j) with which we are dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.448" offset="975245">But there are nonconstitutional issues in the Court case which are different from the non-constitutional issue in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.977" offset="1005338">And there is one further fact which I should mention at the outset which may have some significance and may not which does differentiate the court case from the present case, because this appellee is a dual national, that is since birth, he was a national of both Mexico and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.952" offset="1077227">The Court in the next case so far as we know is only a national of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.186" offset="1098125">Now, the facts are very simple.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.274" offset="1422566">And my first point is that this amendment of the complaint at that time when the case was remanded before was not pursuant to the Commission which this Court had given in the 1959 term and it's remanded only on the issue of collateral estoppel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.665" offset="7456120">In addition to the contentions ably advanced by Mr. Davis, may I also inquire whether the true task is not what in excessive zeal, I may have included in the prayer of the complaint, but rather what the trial judge in his considered judgment put in his judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.642" offset="7556012">And, in this particular case as it happens, some of what I'm saying is ex cathedra now, the record could easily be augmented to show what I'm about to say.</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.693" offset="7716195">And the gist of that case was at the Court, in similar circumstances, rejected the attempt of counsel to obtain injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2050.047" offset="8305622">I thoroughly agree with Mr. Davis that the assertion of that the word “injunction” should somehow be enlarged by judicial construction to include an action for declaratory relief simply because derivatively or contingently, there may also be an impact on federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.728" offset="8412306">I think that assertion is entirely correct and I concur with them in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.400" offset="8439056">I have looked at the F.2d reports on Trop and Perez, and it does not appear clearly whether injunctive relief was sought, but it does seem quite clear that a single-judge sat in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.712" offset="8512303">And I would urge again that what is really determinative here is not what counsel sought, but what the Court gave.</text>

            <text syncTime="2163.827" offset="8760780">A court can reasonably assume jurisdiction of a particular count and try it and validly try it and reject taking jurisdiction over another count and there would be no essential difference between that and what has happened here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.808" offset="8924620">The Solicitor General has, in my opinion, avoided the essential question here with almost unbelievable deafness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.113" offset="8961923">There is a basic fact before the Court which is agreed upon and stipulated, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.613" offset="8987836">And that is, that in 1944, when this Section 401 (j) was passed, Mendoza was a nonresident alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.907" offset="9041021">He was in Mexico, because he had gone there in 1942.</text>
