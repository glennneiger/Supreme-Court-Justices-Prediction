            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="5.545" offset="125576">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.332" offset="136652">This case, the Gilmore case, is here on certiorari to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.938" offset="151176">As I said yesterday, it involved a litigated divorce action.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.446" offset="169148">The deduction claimed is for the cause of conducting the litigation in the California State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.860" offset="202794">The respondent and Dixie Gilmore were married in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.093" offset="219721">In 1952, after six years of marriage, they sued each other for divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.190" offset="244172">At the time of the divorce proceedings, Mr. Gilmore owned a controlling stock interest varying from 60% to 100% and three corporations, each of which was a licensed General Motors automobile dealer, either Chevrolet or Pontiac dealerships.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.616" offset="321808">He was the president and the managing officer of each of the corporations, and he received compensation, salaries from the three corporations totaling approximately $67,000 a year of which $15,000 came from Don Gilmore-San Francisco which was the name by one of the corporations and the one of which he owned 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.780" offset="422536">His dividends in the three corporations averaged about $83,000 a year so that his total income from the corporations came to a $150,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.998" offset="463391">He had virtually no other sources of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.276" offset="472482">His other income was nominal.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.571" offset="485648">One of the issues in the divorce action was whether the stock of those three corporations was in part community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.801" offset="518562">Mr. Gilmore had owned the stock at the day of the marriage so it started out as his separate property.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.671" offset="546043">However, during the six years of the marriage from 1946 to 1952, the corporations had retained some $600,000 out of current earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.050" offset="583555">And Mrs. Gilmore claimed that those earnings in excess of the fair rate of return from the invested capital, the corporations should be attributed to the personal services of Mr. Gilmore and therefore were community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.663" offset="642069">And it would follow from that that by leaving the earnings in the corporations, he in effect made a contribution to capital of community property and that would convert the stock pro tanto to the extent that it represented the retained earnings into a community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.785" offset="710510">Mr. Gilmore contended that he had been paid salaries that were more than adequate for his services and that the extraordinary earnings during those years were attributable rather to the good fortune of the corporations in having the Chevrolet and Pontiac franchises during the immediate post-war period.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.416" offset="785011">Now that issue in the case is entirely separate in terms of the matters of proof involved from all the other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.291" offset="816567">The other issues were first to which party the divorce would be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.250" offset="840391">Dixie Gilmore had prayed for divorce on the grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.661" offset="865991">And Mr. Gilmore had counterclaimed for divorce on grounds of extreme cruelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.087" offset="887724">The next issue was whether alimony was to be given to the wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.477" offset="905279">That turned upon whether she got the divorce or not because in the California law, she can be given alimony only if she was awarded a divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.477" offset="937253">And the third issue remaining was how the community property, if there was any community property, was to be divided between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.738" offset="978317">Now under California law, a divorce based upon extreme cruelty or adultery in such a case, the Court is required to divide the community property unequally giving more than half and up to all of the property to the innocent spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.185" offset="1052087">Now those three issues, mainly divorce, alimony and division of community property all involved a common litigation effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.419" offset="1085001">They all turned on the same thing, namely, which party got the divorce, which party was the innocent or less wrong one or more wrong one.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.442" offset="1125125">The case went to trial, turned out to be a rather sensational trial that lasted 24 trial days, occupied about 3000 pages of transcript in many headlines in the local newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.287" offset="1184475">A -- only --</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="270.744" offset="1186356">Is this a jury trial in California?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="273.181" stopTime="504.695">
            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="273.181" offset="1196074">No, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.953" offset="1199208">It's a trial to the court as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.534" offset="1213524">The main bulk of the trial was concerned with the charges and the counter charges of misconduct; adultery, alcoholism, physical and verbal abuse, a charge against the wife, proof or that she engaged in abnormal sex acts with other women, charged by her that he has encouraged her to do so, his defense, that he was simply an onlooker.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.761" offset="1314461">It was described by Appellate Court as one of the most sorted cases that ever had to deal with and this was the substance of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.015" offset="1351450">And it's not an overstatement to say that the question here is whether Mr. Gilmore can deduct his business expense, the cause of proving that his wife was a morally defrayed alcoholic.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.147" offset="1404008">That's really what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.162" offset="1416025">The outcome of the trial was a complete victory of Mr. Gilmore.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.370" offset="1428877">He was awarded a divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.004" offset="1435355">His wife was denied a divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.916" offset="1447058">She was -- there's got to be no community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.201" offset="1460224">The judge initially awarded alimony of $9000 a year to Mrs. Gilmore notwithstanding that he denied her divorce but when it was pointed out that he couldn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.633" offset="1497945">That was vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.669" offset="1506095">She appealed to the District Court of Appeals in California which reversed and remanded for a new trial because it thought the judge had not given adequate weight to the proven adultery by Mr. Gilmore in the period following the divorce complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.648" offset="1577984">On Mr. Gilmore's appeal then to the Supreme Court of California, the judgment of the District Court -- of the trial court was reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.151" offset="1611943">And the final result was that Mr. Gilmore got the divorce and Mrs. Gilmore got nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.375" offset="1636916">In 1953 and 1954, Mr. Gilmore had expended about $40,000 in conducting this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.029" offset="1667532">That's attorney's fees, records, transcripts, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.655" offset="1686026">He claimed the deduction of 80%, some $32,000 of those -- of the total cost as a expense deductible under 23 (a) (2) of the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.617" offset="1741824">That is to say an ordinary and necessary expense incurred for the management conservation for maintenance of income producing property.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.112" offset="1783829">The Court of Claims accepted the allocation of the expenses, the 80%-20% allocation attributing 80% of the fees to his -- to the ultimate purpose of protecting his interest in the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.028" offset="1851434">This is a factual matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.971" offset="1859271">Now since the Court admitted that only a small part of the trial was directly concerned with the existence of community property, it justified that 80% allocation on the ground that as a second line of defense, it was necessary to prove that he was entitled to the divorce so that if there were community property, it can be awarded to him nonetheless and could not -- or be awarded to the wife and most of it to the wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.339" offset="1960730">And it also added as a further basis to support the allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.271" offset="1984449">The fear of Mr. Gilmore that the charges, if not disproved made by his wife, would harm his reputation and cause General Motors to cancel the corporation's franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.133" offset="2047875">Now on the -- taking all those considerations into account, it accepted the allocation that 80% of this total effort was for the purpose of protecting his interest in the corporations and we do not challenge that allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.164" offset="2108061">Now, the basis on which the Court held that that part is --</text>

            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="509.064" offset="2139617">I said -- I don't think we really took an exception to the total allocation in the Court of Claims except to the impossibility of making the application but in any event here, we do not challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.157" offset="2187995">There is a question about what it represents, what the 80% represents?</text>
            <text syncTime="526.672" offset="2210043">We say that it represents only in part the cost of litigating whether there was community property because that was only a small part of the trial and that -- and also includes a large part of the expenses of litigating the misconduct allegations which were held to be attributable to protecting the stock interest indirectly and namely through the effect on the division of community property and through the effect upon reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.276" offset="2324459">But we don't challenge if -- we properly understand the findings of the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.168" offset="2343999">I think they're quite clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.883" offset="2350895">We don't challenge them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.115" offset="2355806">We accept that 80%, $32,000 was spent solely for the purpose of keeping his interest in the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.995" offset="2395303">That's why he's been it.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.935" offset="2399065">That's what the case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.757" offset="2406379">We accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.014" offset="2415470">Now, the basis upon which the Court of Claims held that that amount was deductible, how it qualified under 23 (a) (2) was not looking at all that the nature of the claims asserted by the wife but solely at the consequences of those claims if they were not defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.186" offset="2504077">It reasoned that if the wife were successful in her claim, she was entitled for $300,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.719" offset="2526229">That's half of the retained earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.554" offset="2537618">Mr. Gilmore would be required to dispose of the large part of his stock in the corporations, either to sell it to raise the money or give it to her in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.728" offset="2574294">In that event, he very likely would have lost control of the corporations and would then lose his overpaid job as president of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.818" offset="2618598">And indeed, General Motors might cancel the franchises because of the change of ownership if it hadn't already canceled the franchises because of the damage of his reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.144" offset="2655901">Now, because of these disastrous consequences might follow from her claims if they were successful the Court said resisting them and avoiding those consequences was conservation of income producing property, namely, his stock and his job in the corporations.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.137" offset="2763943">I mean 23 (a) (2) is the only provision under which they could be claimed that I'm aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.786" offset="2786513">There is another provision litigating tax liabilities which was involved in the Davis case last year if you remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.808" offset="2814621">But here, the only relevant provision is 23 (a) (2) or 23 (a) (1) which is the trade or business expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.585" offset="2857671">Now, our position as I suggested yesterday, is that the aspect that you look to, to determine the character of the expenses is not of the consequences that will follow from the claim -- from the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.706" offset="2918170">The judgment will expend itself on income producing property, but rather the source of the claim, the transaction from which the claim arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.535" offset="2961533">I would like to begin by considering the language of 23 (a) (2) which speaks of ordinary and necessary expenses incurred for the management, conservation or maintenance of property held for the production of income.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.166" offset="3292035">Now, the premise of the Court is that an expense incurred to avoid a liability that would require you to sell property that happens to be income producing to raise the money to pay the liability this conservation of income producing property.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.023" offset="3347414">Now, I suggest that's a -- quite an awkward, far from being literal, an awkward reading of conservation of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.767" offset="3378448">For one thing, the statute speaks of property and not of an interest in property.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.529" offset="3397465">Now what Mr. Gilmore was doing here, he was trying to keep his ownership of the property and not conserving the thing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.126" offset="3423901">Conservation equally implies, I suggest, a physical safeguarding, a protecting of the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.643" offset="3453994">The -- for -- in terms of stocks and bonds, the conservation would be the fee paid for the safe deposit box in which you keep them so they don't get stolen, and equally when that term is used in connection with management and maintenance which also relate to the operations performed with respect to the asset of the thing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.651" offset="3545945">I think the natural reading of conservation is of the same order of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.879" offset="3574888">There's another difficulty with the literal reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.337" offset="3592756">It speaks of incurred for these objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.518" offset="3609475">And the Court of Claims says that since these objects will be the result of the expense, it is for the object.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.016" offset="3639463">But that uses for in the sense of the result achieved prospectively by the expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.113" offset="3667780">But what if, for example, an employee hired to do some repairs on minimal property, negligent and causes injury and you're sued for that and you try to deduct the fees for that, that the fees in Court don't achieve maintenance of the property, there, a result of past maintenance efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.076" offset="3751685">And so before there, you have to turn around to say the cost of maintenance and not as it had been achieved by the expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.656" offset="3781987">Now all I'm trying to really suggest, I don't -- we aren't arguing that you should read the statute that way, and I think purely you shouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.588" offset="3813752">All I'm trying to suggest is that our argument is not contrary to the literal language of the statute and the statute is so broad and so -- and self-defining that we have to look elsewhere for its meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.741" offset="3866311">And I think the main source of its meaning is the history of 23 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="945.467" offset="3885223">Before 1942, 23 (a) was limited -- limited deductions to those incurred in carrying on any trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.815" offset="3918660">The Treasury gave that from a narrow construction and said not all income producing activities qualified as “trade or businesses”.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.518" offset="3961396">And in 1941, this Court in the Hagan's case and two other cases basically adopted that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.964" offset="3991280">They held that simply holding stocks and bonds is not a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.136" offset="4011865">And therefore, the taxpayer, Mr. Higgins, could not deduct the expenses and maintaining the staff office to handle his investments, his portfolio of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.480" offset="4057318">He had very large investments and a full time office staff, just having the dividend checks and things such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.302" offset="4088560">It was held that he could not deduct those expenses because it didn't qualify as a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.248" offset="4112384">Congress properly responded by adding 23 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.665" offset="4130043">And the Committee Reports say, it was added because of the inequity revealed by the Higgins case, a tax in the income from such activities for not allowing the deduction of the ordinary expenses turning them on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.515" offset="4189393">And the Committee Reports made perfectly clear that the only purpose was to expand the kinds of activities the expenses of which are deductible to eliminate the distinction between the technical or trade or business and other kinds of income producing activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.756" offset="4254386">Now any kind of income producing activity whether it'd be withholding property or running a grocery store is equally entitled on a subject matter for deduction of expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.359" offset="4312795">Now what we say is that the difference between 23 (a) (1) and (a) (2) is little -- concerns solely with expanding that category of activities and does not affect the question what relationship must exist between an expense and the income producing activity to qualify the expense as an expense of the activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.543" offset="4409553">And that's the question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.736" offset="4418330">Maybe, I can put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.086" offset="4427734">The expense here is claimed as an expense of his holding of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.933" offset="4443094">Now before 1942, expenses of stockholding were deductibleSo he wouldn't even qualify at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.296" offset="4472560">23 (a) (2) says, “Yes, expenses of stockholding are deductible”, and we're left with the question, “Is this an expense of stockholding?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.544" offset="4505579">Or, “Is this an expense of his marriage?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.484" offset="4521357">And that's the question in this case and that question 23 (a) (2) is not directed towards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.523" offset="4545494">And for our purposes, we can call 23 (a) (1) and 23 (a) (2) as both providing for the deduction of business expenses, ignoring the technical distinctions between kinds of business activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1169.729" offset="4782268">I think that is a difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.066" offset="4791672">I think the answer should be that it's not deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.156" offset="4804002">The difficulty rises to my mind not because of the impact upon his income earning capacity that's going to hurt his future business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.972" offset="4843290">But because the charge rose out of prior business activities, I'm assuming that it's because of his past action act as a businessman in the course of business that prompted the charge and that was really the generating source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.421" offset="4917060">Now actually, let me say that my main point is simply -- you have to look to the source and nature of the claim to make the characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.446" offset="4949138">Now once you look there, there are still a lot of problems and we really meet them in this case because of the community property aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.885" offset="4978918">But my main point is that what you look at is the source and nature of the claim and not simply the effect a judgment is going to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.005" offset="5023431">Now, I think that as we conclusively decided by two decisions of this Court, the Kornhauser case and the Lykes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.696" offset="5058121">Now, the Kornhauser case involved the converse situation, a claim that arose from a business transaction but threatened only personal assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.381" offset="5096887">Mr. Kornhauser was sued by an ex-law partner of his who claimed that some fees he'd received really belonged to the partnership because they were for services performed while the partnership was in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.220" offset="5144221">He successfully defended on the ground that he'd earned this later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.958" offset="5159163">And that this Court held that the expenses were deductible, the expenses of defending that lawsuit, approving a line of ruling that had held deductible the expense of defending malpractice suits and suits of that kind and saying they established the principle that if it results from the conduct of the business is deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.890" offset="5238888">The effect of the judgment is not the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.660" offset="5249964">The Lykes case, I think, really reads directly on this case because it involves a claim personal in origin and business and threatened consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.204" offset="5288208">That was involved -- Mr. Lykes' may give large flock of stock to members of his family, reported them for gift tax purpose of stated valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.343" offset="5328750">The commissioner thought the valuation too low and his litigation about what the value of the stock was for getting tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.017" offset="5363440">It was ultimately settled by his paying and agreed upon decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.810" offset="5378591">He claimed the deduction for the expense of litigation on the ground that had the original petitions he had been sustained, it would have required him to sell all of -- the rest of his stock which was his sole income producing property and therefore resisting the deficiency was protecting his other stock and it was a conservation of income producing property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.668" offset="5462079">In this Court and words which I think is directly applicable to this case, said, that the mere fact that your existing liability to keep income producing property doesn't make any expense of conserving income producing property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.671" offset="5514010">I think that governs this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.269" offset="5524459">I should say that -- those were not dealt with the community property aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.424" offset="5557060">Very briefly, I would like to suggest what that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.995" offset="5571375">First, you have to distinguish the two kinds of expenses involved here, those litigating the misconduct issues and those for litigating the existence of community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.139" offset="5607946">As in this conduct issues, the suit really amounts to a claim for a remedy for personal wrongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.662" offset="5638040">The wife is claiming that she's entitled to some of his half of the community property because of the wrong done to her and he says he's entitled to some of her half because of the wrong done him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.686" offset="5674088">That's simply like tort suits arising from the wrongs and that's the genesis of the rights asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.076" offset="5699688">That we say follows automatically from the basic principle I'm suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.051" offset="5719542">The remaining question, the small part of the fees went -- (Inaudible) specifically to the question of whether or not part of the stock was community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.176" offset="5760084">We acknowledge this poses a much more difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.317" offset="5776593">Even if you looked at the nature of the claim, you still have a problem characterizing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.327" offset="5792684">Is it personal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.955" offset="5795192">Is it capital?</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.238" offset="5800312">Or is it a deductible current expense?</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.298" offset="5824554">We say as well in our brief that if you reach that question, we think it is clearly -- quite clearly capital and it probably ought to be treated us personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.655" offset="5866036">Well primarily, we suggest to the Court that you don't need to get into that, that isn't quite the cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.417" offset="5885053">The case is here to resolve the basic dispute about whether the threat to income producing property is a basis for deduction if that's what the conflict was about between the Baer case and the Second Circuit case, and that's why we brought the case here and we suggest that you -- when you get to the tail end of the case in achieving this community property issue, you can properly just remand that for consideration by the Court of Claims rather than in --</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.040" offset="7239555">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.733" offset="7262333">Respondent has tried to emphasize that in California where this case came from, the husband and wife have sort of a dual relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.709" offset="7334222">They have a very definite and well-defined relationship in respect to their community earnings and community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.151" offset="7371943">It's like a partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.268" offset="7384482">And the authorities which we have referred to in our brief have said so time and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.992" offset="7411336">The husband and wife, like partners, share the gains and profits and losses of the community equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.167" offset="7460028">They made contracts with each other just as strangers may do and may terminate their community property relationship without terminating their marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.844" offset="7510706">Now, in a divorce case such as the one at bar, the Court had the -- they had this at the trial court, had before it a number of issues and one of the things brought before the Court was the accounting for the community property of the husband and wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.886" offset="7602866">It wasn't necessary that that accounting, preceding, be included in the divorce case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.245" offset="7628361">But as I see it because the divorce court is a court of equity and an order to avoid the multiplicity of sins, that was the time and place to adjudicate the community property or marital partnership, if you will, relationship of the husband and wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.617" offset="7713834">And the findings of the Court of Claims show very clearly that there were considerable accounting procedures involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.560" offset="7749569">It was the residue of that accounting that Mrs. Gilmore (Inaudible) her begins that because that was the major part of the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.067" offset="7791679">Those were the major assets and that of course is what the case was about as my worthy opponent had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.875" offset="7830862">She claimed that the increase in value that is the gain which would ultimately be taxable, if the Court please, if and when that court -- the stock were disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.585" offset="7889690">That gain comprised community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.761" offset="7902438">It was attributable to the skill and efforts of the husband and that she was entitled to half of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.821" offset="7926680">And it has been conceded by the petitioner that finding 30 of the Court of Claims is to be unquestioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.484" offset="7989269">There's no attack on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.082" offset="7995747">And that finding very clearly states and I have referred to it in the brief that 80% or more of the amounts which Don Gilmore paid to his attorneys and his accountant were for services rendered by them to defeat Dixie Gilmore's claim to one-half of the value of the increase of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.974" offset="8095222">That is her claim that the increase was community, and a work community of course she'd be entitled to one-half of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.728" offset="8134301">Now then of course with the -- that stock was properly held for the production of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.278" offset="8168469">Now, I have time and time again in studying this case, come back to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.339" offset="8196681">And I think the statute contains certain keywords which to me are like needles of a compass pointing the way to a solution of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.107" offset="8251852">I would like to read the statute, the applicable words of the statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.249" offset="8292394">Section 23 states that in computing that income there shall be allowed as deductions in the case of an individual, all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year for the production or collection of income or for the management, conservation or maintenance of property held for the production of income.</text>

            <text syncTime="2142.525" offset="8673468">I'm in agreement and I believe that that very -- that the philosophy and purpose of adding that portion to the statute is quite significant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.014" offset="8743476">Congress saw that would -- that it would be inequitable not to allow the deduction of expenses which relate not only to the production of income but relate to the conservation of property held for the production of income because when one conserves property held for the production of income, actually, you're conserving the income which will be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.047" offset="8871581">So that is a cohesive statute as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.265" offset="8896449">And this Court has laid down a rule which can be followed in this case and I think should be followed in this case and in the case of Trust against Bingham -- Trust -- Bingham Trust often cited -- the Trust of Bingham or Bingham's Trust, and I referred to it in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.795" offset="8994565">Objections were made in the Bingham's Trust case that certain attorney's fees that were incurred to defend against the proposed income tax deficiency were not deductible because those expenses were not incurred to produce income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.845" offset="9058722">It's very interesting that of that juncture in the history of the statute, that the Internal Revenue Service gave way so -- they gave way reluctantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.827" offset="9114728">They insisted that -- that in order for expenses to be deductible they had to be not only for the conservation or management of property held production income but also they had to produce income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.474" offset="9173243">The Tax Court disagreed with the Commissioner for Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.765" offset="9190484">The Second Circuit reversed the Tax Court, agreeing with the Commissioner and this Court ruled otherwise and affirmed the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.263" offset="9236459">And Mr. Chief Justice Stone speaking for the Court stated that the objections made by the Commissioner failed to take proper account of the plain language of 23 (a) (2).</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.784" offset="9862457">Now we have gone to some things to point out the parallelism of the two cases in our brief and I have even pointed out that a case of that kind could occur in a divorce case that husband and wife being law partners, as visible partners were could've -- had it -- have been involved in a litigation, involved in the accounting for community earnings that had been stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.498" offset="9993383">And I think it's not too difficult to see that on the fact that the cases are quite parallel and that the law partner who sued the other claims that the -- that the stock held by his former partner consisted of these earnings received for services performed by the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.159" offset="10099963">That is while this man was a partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.574" offset="10113651">And the attorney -- the law partner who sued to be successful in that case, he incurred attorney's fees and he deducted them from his income and the Internal Revenue Service at that time claimed that since the partnership terminated the expenses that were incurred were personal in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.557" offset="10213648">And that therefore they were not deductible.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eli Freed</label>
            <text syncTime="3035.034" offset="12243466">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.341" offset="12244720">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.082" offset="12251721">And it isn't the source and nature of the -- that isn't the source at least, of the claim that she makes that determines that whether such expense is deductible because obviously the source there is the divorce, because the alimony and the divorce go together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.425" offset="12341060">But in the case that -- in my argument, I'm trying to point out that there is a separate in this between the community property relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.695" offset="12378154">There's a great separateness not entirely so but there is the very substantial and practical separateness between the community property relationship and the marital relationship that I've pointed out in the brief that California has been criticized or that is to say people have been criticized -- have criticized community property states for enacting statutes which, in fact, create a business relationship between the husband and wife which later contends as a sort of a violation of the Holy Sacrament.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.986" offset="12535306">But nevertheless it exists that the statute has created that situation in California with Baer (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.160" offset="12568012">Now in relation -- in regard to the capital expenses, I think that Kornhauser is also authority our way, (Inaudible) they point them out withstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.565" offset="12625586">In Kornhauser, the law partners sued his former law partner for a part of the stock that which he claimed had been received for services rendered by him as a law partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.601" offset="12685772">And the Internal Revenue Service claimed in the Kornhauser case that that expense was deductible not only because it was personal because -- but also because of this capital that was for the protection of the ownership of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.135" offset="12747943">And this Court held against that and other cases have thrown light on that subject by saying that if the primary purpose of the litigation is in accounting in a nature of a disclosure and a reporting of income and expenses in order to arrive at a certain result as to what share the -- say the party -- what shares the party should have in the particular property that is not a suit to acquire a title, it's not a suit -- and when the defender is not a suit to defend the title, it has indirect incidence with titles but that's not the purpose of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.063" offset="12931636">And the regulation I'd like to point out which is referred to time and again a number of ways under different sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.782" offset="12970506">The regulation state that expenses in defense of title or to establish title are not deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.784" offset="13002480">We don't have that situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.000" offset="13011362">Thank you.</text>
