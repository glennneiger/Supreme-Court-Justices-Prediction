            <label>Mr. George N. Leighton</label>
            <text syncTime="45.952" offset="287222">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.232" offset="304253">This is a reargument of the case in which certiorari was granted to review a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirming dismissal of petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus filed in the District Court after exhaustion of all the remedies under Illinois law.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.552" offset="409579">To set this case in proper perspective, I would first take the facts which give rise to the substantive federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.442" offset="453151">Then I will briefly state the procedural history of this case including the federal questions presented for Your Honor's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.766" offset="490454">And finally, I will present the argument which I believe will support petitioner's contention that his conviction in the Illinois criminal court violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.052" offset="547610">In stating the facts Mr. Chief Justice, I will only refer to the undisputed facts in this record so that it may be clear that I will not rely upon any fact about which if there's any dispute between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.654" offset="609991">On January 1, 1954 at about 1:45 a.m., Charles Townsend was arrested in the City of Chicago by Chicago police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.390" offset="660982">At that time, Townsend was 19 years of age and since he was 15, he had been a narcotic addict and just about an hour and a half prior to this arrest, he had taken a large injection of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.718" offset="738200">These facts were all known by the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.042" offset="755545">He was taken to the second district police station in the City of Chicago, questioned a short time about the murder of a man named Jack Boone who had been found dead on December 18, 1953 in the City of Chicago, not very far from where Townsend was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.523" offset="833494">About five o'clock that morning, he was transferred to another police station where he remained without being interrogated by anyone until approximately 8:30, the evening of January 1, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.287" offset="896502">He was then brought back to the same police station where he first been taken and interrogation resumed of Townsend by the same police officers who in the meantime had gone off on their breaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.015" offset="959404">Soon after he was brought back to the second district, there was what we called in Chicago police practice, a show up for the purpose of enabling a man named Gus Anagnost to identify Townsend as the man who had attacked him with a brick sometime before.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.922" offset="1027009">Gus Anagnost did not identify Townsend as the assailant.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.259" offset="1044459">In fact, he picked out another man in this show.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.264" offset="1060446">Soon after that episode, the police officers attempted to continue the interrogation of Townsend and they discovered that Townsend was then in the throes of the withdrawal symptoms of the drug he had injected the early morning hours of that day.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="258.024" offset="1135470">This was now how long after his arrest?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="261.447" stopTime="387.113">
            <label>Mr. George N. Leighton</label>
            <text syncTime="261.447" offset="1149158">Approximately 14 hours, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.405" offset="1165040">Now, at that point, the Assistant State's Attorney who took the confession here involved had arrived at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.616" offset="1213837">He saw Townsend and he himself suggested that a doctor be called and as he said to his superiors to determine the capabilities of Townsend to withstand interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.672" offset="1278098">A doctor employed by the police department was called and he came to the police station arriving there about 9:45 p.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.257" offset="1312371">He immediately diagnosed Townsend's condition as a narcotic addict in the withdrawal symptoms and he then prepared a solution consisting of phenobarbital, a sterile content of the tool we had and what he said later was 1/230-grain of hyoscine.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.437" offset="1413099">And that when he attempted to inject this into Townsend there was some quarrel between Townsend and the doctor as to where this injection was to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.087" offset="1447685">Now, it is very clear in this record, if Your Honors please, that none of this was of Townsend's choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.639" offset="1473912">The closest thing the record shows is that Townsend complained of being ill, the rest of it was entirely the determination of the police around them.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.982" offset="1519261">And in this record, it is also important to remember that at the time that this doctor was called, witnesses for the prosecution all testified that Townsend had said that he did not want to talk about this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.085" offset="1583731">The police officer who seemed to have been the principal officer so testified Mr. Janega who took the confession, emphatically explained that when he saw Townsend, Townsend indicated an unwillingness to talk about the case at all because of his inability to answer any question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="387.113" stopTime="388.955">
            <label>Justice Tom C. Clark</label>

            <text syncTime="390.567" offset="1665651">Now, there is in this record, one little place in this record, Mr. Justice Clark in which one police officer, not the principal police officer, one police officer inferred from an answer to a question that Townsend had said something that seems to have been incriminatory sometime prior to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.138" offset="1731897">But no way it is attached to this statement in view of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.456" offset="1749243">But he had not made any statement, he had not confessed to be at the crime.</text>

            <label>Mr. George N. Leighton</label>
            <text syncTime="438.330" offset="1856658">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.368" offset="1860838">Now, there was a quarrel Mr. Justice Goldberg between Townsend's testimony here and the doc -- and the police officer whether the idea of calling the doctor was entirely the police off -- there is, but we don't rely upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.793" offset="1906500">There is a general consent that he asked to see a doctor, the doctor was called.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.665" offset="1922069">But the point we make is that the doctor was not of his choosing, it was a police doctor employed by the City of Chicago who came there.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.929" offset="1947042">The medicine was not of his choice.In fact, the record shows very clear that when the time came to make the injection, he resisted the injection, the doctor wanted to put it here, he asked them to put it there, but nonetheless the doctor said, “I'll do it, I know how to do this,” and he injected the drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.827" offset="2010676">Now, it is clear in this record that a miraculous result developed as a result of this injection.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.679" offset="2058115">This man who had told that Mr. Janega that he didn't want to talk, who had told the police officer that he couldn't speak, the same man whom the police officer described that he was bent so many times, and with pain that he couldn't count how many times he kept on bending over complaining, the same man no soon as the injection was completed, the doctor walked out one -- one door, in the same room, he was taken into the adjoining room immediately and there according to everyone involved, every single witness of the prosecution, a completely changed individual was there willing to answer every question asked to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.549" offset="2221537">Not only that he did give one confession on the record now before Your Honors but he gave five.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.535" offset="2249540">He gave one that he robbed Gus Anagnost, the man whom had said that Townsend did not rob him.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.440" offset="2285171">He gave a confession that he had murdered a man named Thompson, a homicide concerning which the police had to admit they had no evidence and even Townsend according to Mr. Janega and according to the police officers had no independent recollection of the episode leading to the death of Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.206" offset="2376182">He also confessed to the murder of a man named Thomas who told his sister that when she came to the hospital, “I had just had an accident, it was just one of those things.”</text>
            <text syncTime="580.650" offset="2426023">And concerning whom the arresting officer or the investing officer complained to the coroner that when he came in response to a call he asked them, “Why did you bothered to call me?”</text>
            <text syncTime="593.109" offset="2475760">There's nothing here indicating a robbery and any of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.306" offset="2488613">He confessed about the murder of Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.605" offset="2505749">He also confessed the robbery of a man named Martin and then finally confessed that he robbed -- to the murder of a man named Boone.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.962" offset="2539186">He also confessed the robbery and murder of a man named Stinson and according to Mr. Janega's report to his superiors, this was such a billion piece of police work.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.032" offset="2579519">He thought these police officers should have been commended because he pointed out to him the cause of the investigation and in connection with this interrogation they found Stinson's shoes, his wristwatch and several other personal items all in and about Townsend or connected to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.852" offset="2650781">The jury heard all of that, if Your Honors please, and found Townsend not guilty and discharged him.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.911" offset="2678993">Now, in this case which was the second of the series of these indictments arising out of these confessions, he was tried and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.346" offset="2728730">A review was had in the Supreme Court of Illinois in which I represented Townsend as the Court-appointed lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.116" offset="2759868">The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed Townsend's conviction and the use of this confession on the ground that the Supreme Court said that the medication given to Townsend by this doctor was a proper medication if not be in shown otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.669" offset="2822040">And that since it was and the thrust of the Supreme Court of Illinois opinion is that since it was not an improper medication, the Supreme Court said that the fact that he also had regurgitated a confession that was use to take his life did not deny due process, and I'll come back to this point when I get to the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.695" offset="2914200">We applied for certiorari before Your Honors and with Mr. Justice Douglas' believing the writ should have been issued, then this Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.566" offset="2949622">Then we went back before the criminal court in Chicago and filed under Illinois law a post-conviction petition alleging that in the course of the review, counsel on appeal had learned that hyoscine which was the only designation but for one other place in the record used in describing this drug to the Court in jury was in fact a drug known scopolamine or in the science work in crime detection also known as the truth serum and that this fact crucial as it was and informative as it was had not been told to the judge or jury that had passed upon the admissibility of the confession and that had used the confession to impose a death sentence against this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.363" offset="3140838">That petition was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.949" offset="3147212">We took another review in the Supreme Court of Illinois and the Court in a memorandum unreported order upheld the dismissal, Your Honors denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.064" offset="3187649">A few days before the execution of Townsend, we filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court and --</text>

            <text syncTime="832.628" offset="3433932">It was just legal argument with sufficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.307" offset="3444590">The affidavits were not controverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.861" offset="3450859">There was no counter-affidavit filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.936" offset="3463084">Now, before Judge Igoe in the United States District Court, we applied for certiorari reviewing all these facts which I just stated to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.805" offset="3498611">In addition to that, by this time I had learned about these five confessions prior to the time of the affirmance in the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.062" offset="3551587">But by this time I then added paragraph 18 to which I'll make further reference in the course of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.428" offset="3585128">Judge Igoe dismissed the petition for habeas corpus on motion of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.809" offset="3614595">And we took an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.647" offset="3629955">The Seventh Circuit dismissed the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.953" offset="3643225">Now, we asked for certiorari in this Court and Your Honors vacated the order of the Seventh Circuit and directed that the matter be heard pursuant to the doctrine of Jennings versus Ragan.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.780" offset="3690454">Of course, that went back before the District Judge and this time respondents obtained the three volumes of the trial in the Criminal Court of Cook County plus the one volume of the post-conviction proceeding and that Judge Igoe proceeded then to the request of the petitioner, a brief and similarly from the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.939" offset="3787107">Briefs were filed and one of the prayers of the brief and one of the contentions made in the brief for the petitioner before Judge Igoe was that we were entitled to a full plenary hearing to determine whether or not it was known at the time of the trial that this drug was the ‘truth serum,' so referred scopolamine, and also whether or not contrary to the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois which we then argued was the use of an impermissible stand to determine due process whether or not a full plenary hearing would not reveal the fact that this petitioner was denied due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.140" offset="3935901">Judge Igoe entered an order after hearing of June 12, 1959, an order that was dated June 24, again dismissing the petition for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.255" offset="3984384">We then appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.008" offset="4003401">The Seventh Circuit affirmed holding that in a habeas corpus application a federal judge is limited to the undisputed portions of the record of the trial court and holding further that it was a burden upon the petitioner to prove that he'd been denied due process and the Court said that this burden, the petitioner had not carry.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.611" offset="4101831">This despite the fact, the record is clear that in the District Court we had asked for an opportunity to prove the allegations of the petition and that opportunity had been denied to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.601" offset="4149791">And on the substantive question, the Court said that -- the Court of Appeals said that there was no denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.805" offset="4178631">Now, this judgment of the Court of Appeals, if Your Honors please, presents two groups of questions, one procedural, another substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.987" offset="4223352">The procedural question presented is whether it is as the Seventh Circuit held that in an application for writ of habeas of corpus, a District Court is limited to the undisputed portions of the record of the trial court and the second procedural question is whether error, prior judicial error was not committed by the Court of Appeals in affirming on the ground which plainly was contradicted by the record, namely to hold that the petitioner had not carried a burden when the course was dismissed on motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.478" offset="4353233">And the opportunity to carry the burden had been denied to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.054" offset="4367548">And finally, the substantive federal question is whether the Fourteenth Amendment is violated by the admission in evidence of a confession taken from a defendant while under the influence of a drug injected by a police doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.501" offset="4441422">Now, dealing with the procedural questions, which I suggest most respectfully, if Your Honors please, are easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.020" offset="4471411">In Rogers versus Richmond, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed an order in a habeas corpus matter and an application for certiorari is made before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.509" offset="4525432">And Your Honors construed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, as meaning that while the District Court in an application for habeas corpus may accept the determinations in the state court, may accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.424" offset="4597112">But he is not bounded by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.546" offset="4605576">He may in his discretion and judgment having examined those records and determined whether or not there is a vital flaw to use the words from Brown versus Allen, he may accept those determinations as one judge may always accept determinations of another judge fully supported by evidence and consistent with law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.742" offset="4698363">But Your Honor said that you read the opinion of the Second Circuit as not making a binding ruling upon the federal judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.034" offset="4727515">And going back to what Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in Daniels versus Allen, the Congress of the United States entrusted to the federal judges, district judges, the duty to determine whether in a state court proceeding resulting in deprivation of liberty or life, whether the Federal Constitution had been fairly and properly determined and we had argued in the District Court that the thrust of the application for habeas corpus was that in the state courts, the federal questions which the petitioner had raised had not been fairly determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.520" offset="4865442">And thus we say, that when the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that Judge Igoe was limited to the undisputed portions of the record that -- that judgment is in conflict with the Second Circuit opinion in Rogers versus Richmond as Your Honors construed that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.995" offset="4935346">Because it isn't true and Your Honors have never held that district judges are limited to the undisputed portions of the state record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.569" offset="4969618">But the facts were true then, habeas corpus wouldn't mean anything to a federal -- to a prisoner from a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.216" offset="4996263">It wouldn't have any meaning because all that -- all that the federal judge would be bound to do was to look and see whether or not there's been some undisputed determinations and there'd be no substance for habeas corpus application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.439" offset="5049135">It was all to nullification of the Habeas Corpus Act as we understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.720" offset="5066271">Now, with regard to the point which the Court of Appeals made that the petitioner did not carry his burden, this doesn't require much more than a comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.360" offset="5108799">I took the time out today just to be certain about it and in the record before Your Honors is the brief I filed for this petitioner before Judge Igoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.400" offset="5140982">Point three in that brief argued that we were entitled to a full plenary hearing and I even try to argue before Judge Igoe that Your Honors caricature of that judgment on application for certiorari amounted to a fine determination that the application for habeas corpus stated the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.356" offset="5220812">And that the Court was without power to do anything else but to grant a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1336.639" offset="5449958">Either in practice or in any reported case, I haven't found that with exception of Griffith versus Rhay and I have conceded, everywhere I've argued, that Mr. John Branion is one of the most respected defense counsels we have in Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.120" offset="5507845">But Mr. Branion just didn't understand the thrust of this question, it was complex.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.523" offset="5853497">Now, the point is made in the course of these proceedings that objections were made before Judge Butler to these other coroner's inquest to the confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.169" offset="5892054">Now, as a defense counsel with some experience, I can understand how, in a murder case, evidence of other charges would be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.875" offset="5930924">And I'm told by a supplemental memorandum here that we have taken the position in this Court, we didn't take in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.997" offset="5959346">But I've looked at the record very carefully and it isn't true that all this was excluded from Judge Butler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.372" offset="5992887">The record shows that when objections were made to these other hearings, the objections were finally overruled by Judge Butler, and he knew, Judge Butler knew that at the time that he was hearing evidence about this particular confession, he knew that at the coroner's hearing, there had been more than one confession taken, and that appears on page 141 of the printed abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.459" offset="6105213">Or if Your Honors need a most certain reference to page 392 of capital A of the typewritten record and Judge Butler overruled the objection and the questions that Judge Butler himself asked showed that he understood that more than one confession was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.606" offset="6173759">He says, Question: “Did you say it was about five minutes?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.297" offset="6192567">He answered, “For that particular statement?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.472" offset="6201240">Question: “Do you voted to asking this defendant questions about the medicine involved?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.802" offset="6218585">Mr. Boone: “That's right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.795" offset="6222555">Question: “Was all the rest of the time that was spent there devoted to discussion about the matters?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.581" offset="6241677">“Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.978" offset="6247320">The Court: “Do you want to object to that question, Mr. Branion?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.331" offset="6264665">The Court: “Objection overruled.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.043" offset="6271561">Judge Butler knew very well that these interrogations at the coroner's hearing involved other charges so that after preliminary hearing to determine the admissibility of this confession, these other facts were either directly or inferentially brought in before Judge Butler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.586" offset="6337703">So it isn't correct to say as we were confronted with the last -- on the original argument that the defense succeeded in keeping out from Judge Butler all the information.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.030" offset="6379499">He knew that a coroner's hearing of this kind and there's enough in this record that have alerted any experienced judge that this was a hearing in which they were trying to do what the police officer said.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.741" offset="6790353">Before, the doctor was called, he didn't want to talk to anybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.645" offset="9253909">He said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.908" offset="9259029">There's a great deal of difference between the parties where that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.682" offset="9270105">Finally, with this police officer questioning him, he finally said yes.</text>
