            <label>Mr. Daniel J. Meador</label>
            <text syncTime="14.964" offset="163192">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.513" offset="181373">This is a habeas corpus case, here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.942" offset="211153">The petitioner is confined in the Virginia Penitentiary under a 10-year sentence imposed upon him under the State's recidivist law which is Section 53-296 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.551" offset="277608">That Section provides for a separate, independent judicial hearing on the recidivist charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.601" offset="313762">It empowers a trial judge on finding three valid trial penitentiary sentences to make a decision whether any further imprisonment is called for, if so, what is the appropriate sentence for any number of years up to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.139" offset="395891">The question here in this case is whether under the Fourteenth Amendment a prisoner, an indigent prisoner without a lawyer, has a right to the assistance of court-appointed counsel at this recidivist trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.051" offset="463600">The case here was commenced below by tuning in the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond by the filing of a habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.239" offset="512293">This petitioner has been denied all the way up in the Virginia courts without a response, without any hearing, so we take the facts here set out in the petition and in the attached exhibits as true.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.931" offset="567045">Those facts show that the following occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.419" offset="581047">In June 1958, the petitioner was confined in the Virginia Penitentiary under a sentence for some prior offense which is not revealed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.410" offset="629008">On June 25th, 1958, he was brought before the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond along with an unknown number of other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.420" offset="677073">At that time, and on that date, the Commonwealth's attorney filed an information against the petitioner under the recidivist statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.383" offset="720854">That information alleged that the petitioner had been three times convicted and sentenced to confinement under the laws of Virginia and it averted that certified copies of those three previous convictions were being shown to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.843" offset="802774">The convictions were not enumerated or described in any way in this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.571" offset="825657">At that point, the petitioner requested that the Court provide him with the assistance of counsel, but the court denied that request and proceeded to sentence the petitioner along with the other defendants to 10 years in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.787" offset="902562">This is a sentence that the petitioner is now serving and it is the sentence which he attacks in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.232" offset="928266">He averts in his habeas corpus petition that the court there was without authority and jurisdiction to sentence him without the assistance of counsel and hence he is now being held illegally by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.893" offset="990960">The judge in the Law and Equity Court dismissed his petition, as I stated, without calling for response and without any hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.815" offset="1030666">He delivered an opinion, accompanying a dismissal, in which he held that under the law of Virginia there was no right to court-appointed counsel at a recidivist trial and he further expressly held that under the Fourteenth Amendment there was no right to court-appointed counsel at this type of proceeding, citing this Court's decision in Gryger against Burke and Chandler against Fretag.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.766" offset="1146441">Following that dismissal of his petition, the petitioner took appropriate and reasonable steps to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.139" offset="1191894">In his petition for writ of error, he expressly set out several times that he was invoking a right to counsel under the Fourteenth Amendment and he cited, he discussed relevant decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.147" offset="1255946">On the basis of that petition, within the record from the Law and Equity Court, the Supreme Court of Appeals denied the writ of error and entered an order, affirming the judgment below on the ground that it was plainly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.022" offset="1331493">This Court then granted a petition for writ of certiorari and appointed counsel to represent the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.286" offset="1356466">We thus have here before us a final decision of the highest court of Virginia in a proceeding in which the federal constitutional right to counsel was claimed in this decision of the state court as necessarily decided that claim against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.208" offset="1436191">Hence, it seems clear that this Court has jurisdiction to review the Virginia judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.581" offset="1465657">Now, petitioner here is contending that the failure of the Circuit Court of Richmond to provide him with counsel at his recidivist trial denied -- violating both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.206" offset="1532217">If it please the Court, I shall leave the equal protection argument to the brief and focus here on due process problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.405" offset="1565027">Under the Due Process Clause, there are two grounds, two propositions on which this case could be decided for petitioner, indeed should be decided on one of the other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.371" offset="1616854">First is that the circumstances of the case, particularly the nature of the recidivist trial itself show that the absence of counsel deprived the petitioner of a fundamental right of a fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.069" offset="1675682">Second proposition, a bit broader, is that the assistance of counsel is necessary to a fair hearing whenever a state moves against a person to put him into penitentiary for substantial number of years of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.470" offset="1741302">Now, turning to the circumstances of this recidivist trial here which demonstrates the need of counsel, the first point I would make is that the cluster of questions which surround the prior convictions under Section 53-296, asserts that no layman can meet them, asserts that no layman could even appreciate the questions existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.355" offset="1864808">Now, the statute itself which for the Court's convenience is in the petitioner's brief at pages 2 and 3, the statute itself simply says that the prisoner may deny the existence of any such reference, but the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia has indicated that there are a number of other questions that may be raised and litigated concerning these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.180" offset="1988106">So it might be pointed out here that even if the petitioner, a layman in jail, read the statute carefully, read it intelligently, he would not be apprised of the questions, the qualifications thrown around the use of certain prior records which have been put there as a matter of judicial gloss.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.900" offset="2074937">Now, for instance, there is a strong indication that if one of these prior convictions are still pending appeal at the time of the recidivist trial, the defendant can object to its use on the theory that it's not conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.883" offset="2130944">Moreover, if two of these prior convictions occurred at the same term of court or on the same day, they cannot both be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.929" offset="2171068">This is not altogether clear, but there is a strong indication it so, but the most important point I would think about the use of these record is the fact that they are open to collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.962" offset="2219238">It seems fair to say that any ground of collateral attack on these convictions can be raised and litigated in the recidivist trial itself whether it be a want of jurisdiction in the convicting court or whether it'd be some constitutional defect.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="547.173" offset="2292067">Is that by judicial gloss or it's not under the statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_j_meador" startTime="550.717" stopTime="816.309">
            <label>Mr. Daniel J. Meador</label>
            <text syncTime="550.717" offset="2306278">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.090" offset="2307741">It's by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia in their opinions by way of holding in dictum, I would say.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.448" offset="2349119">Frequently, this has come up by way of suggestion that a denial of counsel in one of the underlying convictions were voided and hence remove it from consideration in the recidivist trial, but it seems to me fair to say that any federal constitutional defect in one of these convictions would operate to void it and to remove it from consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.957" offset="2443160">For this case, that might be a great importance because if one of the three underlying convictions in this case was successfully attacked, that would leave only two convictions which would mean under 53-296 a maximum recidivist sentence would be five years whereas, for three or more previous convictions, the maximum is life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.091" offset="2547754">The petitioner here in fact received 10 years so it would be possible by attacking one of the convictions to cut his sentence in half in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.790" offset="2590490">Now, last term in Reynolds against Cochran, the Court here pointed to this feature of Florida, habitual criminal proceeding as one aspect of it which demonstrated the need for counsel and showed how counsel could be a benefit to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.889" offset="2678888">Now, the feature of this Virginia proceeding, which above all else, indicates a necessity of counsel, is the sentencing power vested here in the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.501" offset="2741373">This statute gives the trial judge the broadest kind of granted power.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.142" offset="2763943">There is no minimum and no maximum prescribed, that is the maximum is life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.226" offset="2792260">He need not give any sentence at all, as I read the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.524" offset="2809501">That is open for his decision in this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.755" offset="2830399">There is no time limit prescribed on how far back he can go in using old convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.327" offset="2860701">Whether the conviction happened one year ago, 20 years ago, or 40 years ago is immaterial with the statute to the power of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.052" offset="2899571">It's also immaterial to what interval went by between these convictions, whether they were a year or two apart or 20 or 30 years apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.835" offset="2946696">A man may have committed an offense as a youth in decades past, he commits another offense this -- the power of the trial judge comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.134" offset="2987865">It's immaterial, the circumstances, the type of the prior offense are immaterial under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.095" offset="3023705">The only qualification is that it carry a sentence to the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.107" offset="3043767">Whether it is homicide or relatively minor lapse is immaterial to the power of the judge here.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.923" offset="3075114">Or whether it would be a crime of violence or not is of no consequence to the power of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.367" offset="3104789">In short, the legislature in this statute has given the trial judge a blank check over this defendant for remainder of his life, assuming three valid prior sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.307" offset="3160586">That this sweeping power vested in the judge, differentiates this proceeding from a number of other habitual criminal statutes, particularly the West Virginia statute that's just been discussed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.206" offset="3224221">There it might fair to be said that the whole purpose of the proceeding is simply to identify the defendant as a person upon whom the law has already placed a sentence of life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.401" offset="3273017">Here the law itself has placed no sentence on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.000" offset="3291408">The law is simply saying to the trial judge, bring him in and hold the hearing and you decide whether any sentence at all is necessary and if so how much up to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.773" offset="3334457">There is a judicial hearing here on that vital question and here is where I would contend that the need of counsel is the greatest in this proceeding.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="816.309" offset="3368626">Why couldn't that argument be made on a Betts and Brady approach to any case where there was a substantial statute -- a substantial sentence with regards to the judge?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel J. Meador</label>
            <text syncTime="829.072" offset="3419617">Your Honor, I think it might well be.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.066" offset="3427662">All I can say here is that as a matter of degree, the power vested in this trial judge is so much greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.936" offset="3459114">For one thing in an ordinary criminal prosecution, the judge vested with the discretionary sentencing power will have presided over the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.859" offset="3498820">It's tied to a substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.225" offset="3508224">It gives him some context in which to impose a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.099" offset="3523793">Some frame of reference, some body of factual information about the defendant and about what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.230" offset="3556289">Here, the man is brought before the court with no background of this sort, simply records of three prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.590" offset="3593697">Now, to pursue this point further on the sentencing power, this Court itself has recognized in cases that this kind of decision, the matter of sentence, where a sentence is not fixed by law is one of the most difficult kinds of questions that the trial judge can face and that's particularly so in this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.465" offset="3701217">As I say, this is not tied to a substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.258" offset="3716368">Here, the judge's problem is how much more time shall we put this man in the penitentiary over and above all the time he will have served for each one of his offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.961" offset="3763179">The law is already exact with this penalty for each offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.310" offset="3776658">Now, the question is, shall we keep him there over and above that?</text>
            <text syncTime="923.436" offset="3797138">Various writers in courts had mentioned that the judge here has to take into account a number of elements such as protecting society against these habitual offenders, deterring others from repeating crime, to punish him further, to rehabilitate him if he's capable of being rehabilitated.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.608" offset="3865788">All these package of intangible factors here, the judge has to take into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.670" offset="3906017">Now, if we're going to have any kind of rational decision on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.190" offset="3928168">A decision on the sentence if not a mere whimsical decision by the trial judge it's essential that he have before him a body of facts, facts concerning this defendant, his record, his character, his personality, the totality of the factual data surrounding this individual defendant.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel J. Meador</label>
            <text syncTime="983.341" offset="4036733">Yes sir, there's a statute providing for pre-sentence report in felony cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.375" offset="4060871">That's one of the questions I touched on in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.639" offset="4073932">It's not clear to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.550" offset="4077589">There's no Virginia decision that I've found which says this is available in a recidivist trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.699" offset="4106219">However, it appears to me to be discretionary with the trial judge so that he could call on a probation officer to make a pre-sentencing report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.760" offset="4150418">Again, one of our points is that without a lawyer, the defendant is not apt to be aware of this, not apt to call it to the trial judge's attention so that the trial judge could, in his discretion, call for this pre-sentencing report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.084" offset="4223666">Now, it's in this problem of developing the facts relating to this defendant that the lawyer services are so necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.675" offset="4262118">In the first place, by hypothesis, in all recidivist trials under this statute, the defendant will be already in the penitentiary, locked behind walls and hence disabled from getting out, investigating his case, contacting witnesses, preparing in all of the multitude of ways in which a case is prepared on facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.820" offset="4366608">He cannot do it himself even if he had the capabilities and the know-how because he's locked up and he's without money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.124" offset="4395865">So the lawyer is necessarily in that regard, but more than that the lawyer is essential because this is the kind of problem here that even a prisoner who is faced some prosecutions in the past will not be familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.883" offset="4458872">This is a peculiar proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.365" offset="4472874">A prisoner might very well have some appreciation of how to meet a substantive charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.979" offset="4499310">Did he do it or not do it, was he there or not there and all of the various kinds of issues that might come up in an orthodox criminal prosecution.</text>
