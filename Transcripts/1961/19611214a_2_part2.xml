            <text syncTime="3.158" offset="115963">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.047" offset="127561">At recess, I was trying to indicate to this Court the nature of some genuine native rights in Alaska, which were truly rights and to compare them with the rights in quotes which are claimed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.448" offset="181164">Now first, I pointed out that the seal fishery was specially set up by statute and natives had a -- an exclusive right to take seals for subsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.980" offset="223274">No other person was allowed this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.680" offset="234141">Now secondly, there is the Karluk Reservation which this Court sustained in Hynes against Grimes Packing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.904" offset="266951">Now, it sustained it as to which exclusiveness that no other Alaskan or anyone else could fish within the confines of the Karluk Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.399" offset="304985">Now thirdly, the White Act only pertained to commercial fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.675" offset="330062">Now, it did not affect subsistence fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.625" offset="341870">Now, along the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers in Alaska, they have always -- the natives of that area have always fished for King Salmon on the subsistence basis and in doing so, they have used small hand traps and fish wheels and if the Court will note Chapter 17 as amended of the Alaska session laws, which is the statute in issue in this case, you will see that it excludes hand-driven fish traps and fish wheels, which is the means of subsistence fishing along those rivers in Alaska.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.056" offset="511561">They come into the wheel and the wheel just literally picks them right up, carries them around and dumps them into a trawl.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.374" offset="532877">They slide down the trawl into a box where they're kept until the native takes them out.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.673" offset="750111">The Karluk River reservation gives the natives of Karluk an exclusive right to fish the area around the Karluk River.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.122" offset="783862">Now, this Court will recall in Hynes and Grimes Packing Company, it recognized that the Karluk River fishery was perhaps the most important fishery in that area of Alaska.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.187" offset="828165">They -- they take millions of red salmon that come up the Karluk River each year.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.648" offset="857945">It's very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.861" offset="866826">As far as subsistence or the Kuskokwim is concerned, this may not be terribly important to the fish runs, but it's terribly important to the natives on the Kuskokwim.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.239" offset="896293">This is their way of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.661" offset="902040">They eat this fish.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.403" offset="932968">There's no question about that and these are aboriginal natives.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.503" offset="1169429">They're not only were treated equally, they were treated in common.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.693" offset="1946102">Natives were not segregated from the rest to the population.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.986" offset="1971284">We had, except for the Metlakatla in Karluk, no reservations in Alaska whatsoever and these are limited reservations as -- as this Court will see from -- from observing the statutes under which they were established.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.822" offset="2014647">Now, Indians in Alaska have always paid all taxes in Alaska, always.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.622" offset="2033873">They've no distinction between them and other citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.524" offset="2045471">They've always been tried by territorial which were, in those cases, federal courts, along under territorial law.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.966" offset="2075251">They never had a tribal law under which these Indians were -- were tried, always the same -- tried in the same manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.659" offset="2114017">There has been no distinction made between them and the rest to the citizens in Alaska and I pointed out in the brief, but I want reiterate to this Court how completely amalgamated the natives are in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.577" offset="2161664">Now, for instance, natives vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.644" offset="2169919">Now, you've heard -- you've heard the estimate here of how many natives there are in the -- in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.486" offset="2189354">That's approximately, I believe, 12% or something to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.379" offset="2212864">Now, the Alaska Legislature, on the other hand, is composed 15% of natives.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.034" offset="2235538">So I think quite obviously that these natives are not only drawing there support from there native brethren, they're being elected by whites.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.511" offset="2793409">Now -- now that the -- I want to point out -- I point out as not to claim that -- that the Federal Government has lost its jurisdiction over natives in Alaska as the -- as the Federal Government itself points out in its brief, we do not wish to confuse the existence of a power with its exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.482" offset="2881285">We recognized that natives in Alaska may well be subject to federal control.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.689" offset="2898108">We don't con -- we don't contend that they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.445" offset="2909184">What we do contend is that the Federal Government has never sought in the past to distinguish these races and especially not in Alaska's largest industry and that it would be inconsistent with past federal policy to hold that Section 4 did so now, that where the Federal Government made distinctions in the past for subsistence or for a seal fishery or a specific reservation, that makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.061" offset="2999568">That makes sense for the Federal Government to continue this, but it is entirely inconsistent with past federal policy to suddenly take one-half of an entire industry, segregate them on the basis of race where they never had any legal rights and say, “These Indians are now different from the rest of the citizen.”</text>
            <text syncTime="741.618" offset="3069889">They are not subject to state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.476" offset="3077308">They are subject to federal regulation exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.425" offset="3089115">It just -- it -- it's just completely inconsistent with the whole history of federal -- federal policy in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.135" offset="3111894">What -- what that Section means, as -- as we see it, is that where Congress made distinctions, those distinctions were preserved, and they are important distinctions, but they did not make distinctions all through the commercial fisheries and not in relation to traps and those distinctions that never existed should not and were not created by Section 4, that is essentially our argument on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.403" offset="3201024">Now, as a last argument regarding the interpretation of Section 4, we wish to point out the effect that the various interpretations posed here today will have.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.199" offset="3244178">Now, I do not say this because I want this Court to pass on the wisdom of an Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.367" offset="3260792">Obviously, it cannot do that, but we do want to point out that the interpretations urged here today will result in an absurd conclusion and it is a settled point of statutory construction that the Court will not attempt to make an Act of Congress into an absurd -- give it an absurd construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.174" offset="3336025">Now, I want -- I want to point out these various -- these various interpretations suggested and show to Court what will happen under.</text>

            <text syncTime="818.377" offset="3376880">Now, the Government really has, it seems, two views.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.012" offset="3391404">The view in their brief was that -- that the Department of the Interior has full authority over Indian fishing to do with as it sees fit.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.020" offset="3435499">It can authorize 11 traps or it can authorize 111 traps if it wants to and I quote from the Governments brief, “The Secretary has full authority to do what he considers proper for the protection of the Indian fishing rights including enlargement of fishing rights beyond those now enjoyed subject to his consideration of other pertinent factors including -- including conservation.”</text>

            <text syncTime="956.038" offset="3927542">Under the White Act, as I pointed out, there were regulations authorizing areas for traps.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.954" offset="3951156">Now, these regulations occupied no special status under the White Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.606" offset="3969755">They had no more legal affect than a regulation permitting next in a particular area or a regulation closing an area to fishing, or a regulation forbidding a particular stream from being fished in a particular manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.907" offset="4023045">In short, there is no legal difference between the use of fish traps and the use of any other equipment under the White Act, now I'm speaking of, or any other regulation promulgated under the White Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.199" offset="4068185">If fish traps are a right protected by Section 4, all control of Indian fishing was con -- was protected under Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.730" offset="4106324">I cannot urge this too strongly, but the fish traps are no special device.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.347" offset="4124714">They are just like any other thing that was used under the White Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.445" offset="4137148">This controversy has arisen over fish traps and perhaps, it's -- it's ironic that it has because, the fish traps, of course, have been, as I've been pointed out for various reasons, go in the Alaskan throat, not only in the white Alaskan's throat, as you will see in our brief, the natives have constantly opposed fish traps in Alaska, too, through their authorized spokesman.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.674" offset="4410075">Exactly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.961" offset="4415195">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.943" offset="4423137">Now, so let me -- let me consider this question of the results of the interpretations that have been suggested today on the basis that we're not only talking about traps, we're talking about all regulations promulgated under the White Act because there's no distinction between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.553" offset="4481546">Now, let me take an example of first, the broadest interpretation, which has been suggested today that the Gover -- if that's in the Government's brief, if the Federal Government has exclusive authority over all natives fishing in Alaska and can do what it considers proper for them, well, then you have one sovereign state regulating the White fishermen and you have the other sovereign, the Government regulating the native fishermen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.609" offset="4577782">Now, this can be disastrous in a situation and I'll give you a perfect example of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.391" offset="4596903">In Bristol Bay, Alaska, which is the largest salmon fishery in the world, millions of salmon come into that bay in one week, and they are all caught during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.535" offset="4637550">Now, the State's fishing is -- if the State proposes its fishing time on the basis that a certain amount of days will be kept free of fishing so the salmon can get up -- up the streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.890" offset="4678928">It generally allows four, five days, perhaps, in fishing and then closes it for another two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.440" offset="4697109">Well, suppose they embark on this program and then with the two days remaining in the week, they close down their fishery and the Federal Government decides that the natives haven't caught enough, so they open it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.586" offset="4737755">Then what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.276" offset="4740472">You have half the fishermen in the State fishing in Bristol Bay and half the fishermen not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.534" offset="4757504">The State's carefully plan program of five days and two days close goes right down the drain to the detriment of everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.115" offset="4791881">Now, it's true, that -- that -- it's been pointed out that the Federal Government will undoubtedly be guided by thoughts of conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.554" offset="4825631">This is -- this is been -- been reiterated in the briefs, but the trouble is with this that the claims are conflicting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.210" offset="4856247">The real matter -- the reason this -- these traps are been authorized is because the Secretary wants the Metlakatla cannery along with those in Kake and Angoon to have more fish than they would have otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.401" offset="4896998">That's been made quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.616" offset="4901804">He wants them to make -- be in economic successes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.860" offset="4914761">Well, that's just the point in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.686" offset="4922075">Too many people have made economic successes, and there are not enough fish any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.957" offset="4939212">So they are trying to close it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.401" offset="4944959">They are trying to close it down either in stages or whole areas, but if we can't do this, if -- if the only consideration is the economic benefit of this particular Alaskan communities, who are, as I say, full Alaskan citizens, what can we do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.952" offset="5003160">This is half the fishermen of the State we're talking about now, not -- not of little isolated Indian community off in some place, we're talking about half the fishermen of the State.</text>

Kake and Angoon came -- claim aboriginal rights in an area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.400" offset="6968926">Now, I've already pointed out to this Court why I believe that aboriginal rights were extinguished, but let's assume for a moment that they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.190" offset="7000168">I want to show the Court the effect of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.541" offset="7013543">Now, they have minimized their claim to aboriginal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.559" offset="7029635">If the Court will look in the Tlingit and Haida cases which in -- in the Court of Claims which maxed out the area claimed by these Indians, they will find that it occupies all of Southeastern Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.370" offset="7072893">This isn't small area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.937" offset="7079163">This is all of southeastern Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.848" offset="7086791">Now those of you who have seen a map of Alaska or been in Alaska will realize the vast expanse of area this really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.444" offset="7113122">And it's a tremendous fishery down there, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.687" offset="7126079">Now, if Kake and Angoon are right, in the area where Kake and Angoon fish, in that whole Southeastern Alaskan area, aboriginal area we're talking about, they can fish free of state regulations of any kind and if they can, I point out that the States' power now in Southeastern Alaska is -- is nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.607" offset="7213850">It can't regulate if they can only regulate half of it -- the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.890" offset="7226911">This Court recognizes in Missouri against Holland when it was talking about migratory birds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.891" offset="7246973">Now, it -- if I can -- if I can draw an analogy here in -- the Court said that Missouri can't regulate migratory birds because everybody has to be bound by a scheme of conservation when you're talking about migratory animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.690" offset="7298173">Because anyone person could destroy the whole program, but we're talking about migratory salmon here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.022" offset="7319489">These salmon pass hundreds of miles of coastline before they enter the streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.156" offset="7335999">Now, how is the State to plan its fishing effort along those hundreds of miles of coastline if it doesn't know how the Federal Government is going to run its programs in regard to these aboriginal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.945" offset="7387199">In summary, I just want to say, that if the Court upholds this right today, this claimed right, Alaska's fight to gain control over its fisheries is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.463" offset="7437249">We -- we have gained nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.379" offset="8932916">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.440" offset="8961128">There is a certain factual situation that was discussed here by counsels for the appellant Metlakatla Indian Community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.113" offset="8995819">I think we should clear it up from the standpoint as the State sees it, that is relative to the matter of support to schools and a matter of health in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.872" offset="9050885">Now as indicated in previous argument here, the State does operate the schools and also furnishes health facilities in the village in Metlakatla and on the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.777" offset="9102503">And now, in one of the exhibits to the reply brief of the appellants Metlakatla, there is a letter from, I believe the Department of -- United States Department of Education which indicated that practically all of the moneys for the operation of the school in Metlakatla and as far as that is concerned in Kake and -- and Angoon were furnished by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or under the -- the – O'Malley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.441" offset="9221099">I believe it's another prefix term in (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.751" offset="9234369">Now that is true –that is true in Metlakatla, that is true Kake and Angoon, that is true in regard to many of the areas of Alaska, though practically all of the school moneys are furnished by the Federal Government based upon the impact of -- of people in the federal service such as military personnel that are on Anchorage in Fairbanks and the employees living on federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.108" offset="9331754">As the court realizes until statehood not more than 99% of all the lands of Alaska that was federally owned, even after -- even after the land is selected by the State, it was granted to us under the statehood act in which we have a period of 25 years to select in excess of 100-million acres of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.285" offset="9416495">Almost 75% of the State was still owned by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.354" offset="9436766">So, this is not unusual in the fact that Metlakatla and in Kake and Angoon which are on federal lands furnished practically all of the school moneys by the Federal Government under an act that also allows the Federal Government to furnish mo -- money to own bay schools in Anchorage area and to the -- which are also run by the State, they are federal -- federal military reservations, schools were run by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.095" offset="9551705">And the -- the money is furnished by the Federal Government because it is of the impact to the federal people who are temporary in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.813" offset="9586604">Now, in the city of the Anchorage, we have many families who were living off of the (Inaudible) and who are living on – they're maybe living on the federal lands, that's not privately owned, in those -- such as the Alaska Railroad own -- owned land, people were living on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.396" offset="9656926">The money is contributed to the Federal Government to run the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.891" offset="9666957">So there's nothing unique in the -- in the situation that the Federal Government either through the Bureau of Indian Affairs are -- on a similar legislation, furnishes money to the state's schools, but they are all run under the -- on direction of the State Department of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.134" offset="9751907">Now I believe also, in -- in his opening statement that the counsel for the appellants of Metlakatla indicated that, when Metlakatla reservation is set aside that -- that was set aside only for Indians, the language of the statute, I believe, set aside also on certain -- set aside for Eskimos and Aleuts who -- who may join the Indians from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.804" offset="9886595">There are a few -- have been a few Eskimos and Aleuts on Metlakatla -- some of them in fact served on the -- on the counsel of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.784" offset="9998503">Now, as indicated -- indicated by the appellants, the claim of the Metlakatla Indian community is based upon three -- two Acts of Congress and one Presidential and Executive Order; the 1891 Act, the Presidential Proclamation of 1916, the reaffirmance of this proclamation of 1916 by an Act of Congress in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.717" offset="10118248">A question was asked a few moments ago relative to the effect of the White Act upon the Presidential Proclamation of 1916, I think it could very well have been -- have been argued that in absence of the Act of 1934 which reaffirmed the Presidential Proclamation of 1916 setting aside the 3,000 reservations around Metlakatla, that the White Act would have done with the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.597" offset="10245726">State is not contending that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.620" offset="10253876">I think -- I think it's very reasonable that -- that it can be argued and rightly so that under the 1934 Act which have ratified the presidential proclamation of the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.277" offset="10304449">There -- there's no question that that is still an existence because the subsequent Act (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.061" offset="10351574">Traditionally, the Indians of Alaska have been treated, as all other Alaskans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.604" offset="10377801">They have and I am speaking her now particularly Metlakatla the -- the following.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.095" offset="11007770">Well, I think this -- I think there are similar factors we can consider there to sustain the State's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.993" offset="11035355">First is that before Statehood, all territorial laws which were passed to the Territorial Legislature as distinguished from Acts of Congress were enforced against the Metlakatlans, criminal and civil, without any distinction, not only the major crimes act, but all crimes, misdemeanors, and felonies were enforced under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.350" offset="11128769">Now, I think we have to look at Section 60 of the Statehood Act also and look at the intent of Congress in this matter of what was fishing rights -- what they had in mind with these fishing rights at the time they passed the Statehood Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.089" offset="11183731">Under Section 6 (e) of the Statehood Act, Congress turned over to this new state of Alaska all equipment used in the co -- in the regulation and conservation of the fisheries which they then had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.465" offset="11241200">It appears to me, we could not reasonably say that Congress would have turned over all their necessary equipment to conserve and regulate the fisheries if they were going to retain half of the fisheries in the State, or any portion of the fisheries, but they turned over all of the equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3005.657" offset="12126020">That's exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.561" offset="12133648">And of -- of course, as indicated in the previous arguments here, the Secretary of Interior has never made any distinction in the past whether it's in this area of Metlakatla or whether it's in the area of Kake and Angoon, wherever it might be as to the method, the times and -- of fishing, but whether be by Indians, non-Indians, or whoever they might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.609" offset="12229778">And we think its -- that we think that -- that our proposed interpretation to what a fishing right is in this regard relative to the fish traps is consistent with the long interpretation or the long policy of Congress with Department of Interior, in connection with the Indians and their fishing rights in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.931" offset="12347120">Now, going little more into the background as to the relationship of the Metlakatla Community in the State of Alaska, and we have set this out in our -- our brief, I may want to call the Court's attention again is the fact that traditionally, the Alaska legislature, because of depressed areas in the State have set -- have set aside to the executive at each legislative session certain funds for depressed areas to be given up by the executive as the situation arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.889" offset="12466970">In the year 1961, the appellant community was granted $8,000 economic aid from State General funds and there were some 20 communities involved and Metlakatla was approximately 1,000 inhabitants, got this second highest allotment of -- of any of the communities in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.064" offset="12591626">So they've been treated by the legislature, by the executive all along on equal footing from the standpoint of economic aid, from the standpoint of citizens, from the standpoint of the courts, and their jurisdiction over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.822" offset="12646693">And this is the first time, this is first time under territorial status or under states status that the Metlakatla which we have conceded for the purposes of this argument is a reserve, has never raised the question of any state jurisdiction in regards to civil or criminal matters of whatever nature and it appears, to me, to be inconsistent with the -- the long policy of the Federal Government and the Department of Interior by the position they are now taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.499" offset="12809383">As indicated previously, we -- we concede that Federal Government has power to treat Indian Reservations in the State or territory which we feel are all regula -- regulatory authorities, but in this case, we feel that the Congress does not seem fit to go the full distance on the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.788" offset="12882526">That that they have only set aside an area exclusively for the use of these people in fishing, but they left the matter of regulation with the State which have been through in many instances, and many phases of economic and social life in Alaska throughout the years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3248.576" offset="13097671">In the answering brief of the appellant Metlakatla Community in this case on page 2 and 3 of their reply brief, they asked the State to indicate what federal authorities has made the decisions that fishing within reserves to be regulated on a uniform system of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.126" offset="13171858">Although, we do not feel that this is incumbent upon us, the appellees in the matter, we're certainly be glad to indicate our -- our thoughts in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.006" offset="13231417">We point to the Presidential Proclamation of 1916 which is Number 1332, set out in 39, Statute 1777 where it was stated that lands were reserved for the benefit of the Metlakatlans and such other Alaskan natives as of -- joined them or may join them, and residents on these (Inaudible) to be used by them under the General Fisheries Laws and Regulations of the United States as administered by the Secretary of Commerce, of course which was changed under the reorganization by the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.619" offset="13373837">And the -- then the Act of 1934 which in part says, “And any reservation heretofore made by any Act of Congress or executive order or proclamation for the benefit of said Indians, shall continue in full force and effect and shall continue to be subject to modification, alteration, or appeal by Congress or the President, respectively.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.700" offset="13482193">Now, the -- the -- this President Proclamation, this Act of 1934 is still in effect and it's -- if you will look at the -- on page 20 -- 43 of the appellants reply in -- in their brief, not the reply brief, but in their original brief, they state, “Moreover, the Congressional ratification of the Proclamation in 1934, most clearly placed Executive action, our statute on par with the 1891 Law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.160" offset="13636002">We agree with this statement and we agree that the Act of 1934 confirmed the Presidential Proclamation of 1916 which said that the fishing in these waters would be on -- on par with all other fishers -- fishermen in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.399" offset="13757001">Now they've indicated -- the appellants have indicated that they're, “We may not regulate fisheries in reserve on the Doctrine of Preemption.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.443" offset="13785109">They suggest an irreconcilable conflict has arisen between the two sovereigns, and as a result the state power must yield to federal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.954" offset="13815202">The fallacy of this argument is – the will -- the Secretary of Interior does not constitute the will of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.045" offset="13839548">The Secretary has not based his regulation on his own desire he says, but in the way he believes to be the will of Congress that is expressed in Section 4 of the Statehood Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.098" offset="13879777">Now as to his own authority, he said he has, Section 4 of the Statehood Act as to, in regard to any rights that they might have been established under White Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.118" offset="13919796">Mr. Gross has covered that and we contend no right was established under the White Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.481" offset="13937246">The only thing that was established under White Act in connection with these fishers were that they fish on par with everyone else in the Alaskan waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.982" offset="13971310">If the State suggests interpretation of Section 4 of Statehood Act is correct, that only Congress preserved the status quo, that is the only the right (Inaudible) exclusive use of the waters to fish in, subject to Statehood Act to regulate the manner and means of taking its -- taking it on the on the General Fisheries Law, it follows the Secretary's interpretation is invalid, and no question of preemption arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.760" offset="14062425">There must be clear and equivocal expression of congressional will by Congress, if state power is to be preemptive and we submit that there has been no clear congressional action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.315" offset="14116655">We submit that the policy of Congress, the Secretary of Interior prior to Statehood has just -- has been just opposite to what the Secretary's action was in this case in allowing along the fish trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.551" offset="14169527">And we contend therefore that the -- any regulation he has promulgated to allow fish traps is invalid and of no effect and therefore, the state has a right to regulate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3551.618" offset="14309857">One questions from the Court, Mr. Justice Douglas, taking up the statement from the Supreme Court of Alaska that a fish trap catches up to 600,000 fish whereas a seiner takes some 2,000 to 10,000, comes from a 1918 opinion of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.024" offset="14399509">Things have changed since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.263" offset="14404420">I asked the manager of the Kake cannery about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.676" offset="14434095">The average catch of a trap is 65,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.962" offset="14447261">The average catch of big seiner is 45,000 a season.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.470" offset="14469204">Maximum possible for a fish trap is about 150,000 of fish and for a big seiner about 75,000 fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.792" offset="14502536">This is not the ‘big against the small' anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.000" offset="14511417">It might have been at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.041" offset="14523538">With respect to the argument of Alaska, I take it that the -- yes, the Federal Government does have powers in Indian affairs to grant them money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.728" offset="14566275">I should say that Mr. Schifter's client, Metlakatla, gets aid from the Federal Government for Indian schools under the Impacted Areas Statute, he has quoted the letter in the appendix to his brief, on the ground that these are Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.225" offset="14632312">This is a federal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.810" offset="14638582">The State comes in, wants money on that ground because this is an exclusive problem under Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.754" offset="14662405">With regard to Kake and Angoon, they got money under a different Act, the Johnson-O'Malley Act which applies solely and exclusively to Indians so that in both cases, they are getting money from the Federal Government because these are Indians in Indian community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.140" offset="14715904">Mr. Gross thought that the right to use fish traps was not given to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.482" offset="14749341">It was given to just anybody, but if we take that shore, both whites and Indians have the right to use fish traps if they have the wherewithal to do it, and the Indians ordinarily didn't until Congress have told them, the United States bought these few traps for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.309" offset="14812557">They were using them as the matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.546" offset="14825514">When Statehood came, what they were using was not wrongful at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.671" offset="14846098">It's more than -- I was thinking last night, I should have thought of it earlier, Professor (Inaudible) in his lecture on Fundamental Legal Conceptions said that a bare oral license to walkover Blackacre is an interesting land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.643" offset="14905971">It's a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.766" offset="14910464">He uses it as an example of a right in land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.170" offset="14924048">Now, here, these Indians have a right in the use of those fish traps, and the United States said that it reserved to itself the exclusive -- no, the absolute jurisdiction and control until disposed of by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.137" offset="14983920">Many of the other arguments I take to be ad hominem, about how difficult it would be for Alaska to reduce -- regulating here if a number of fishermen are not subject to its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.310" offset="15036583">But that is not an argument to make to this Court, but they should go to Congress with that and ask Congress to terminate the absolute jurisdiction and control which Congress retained that -- with the consent of the State.</text>
