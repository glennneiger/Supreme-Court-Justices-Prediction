            <text syncTime="28.004" offset="215437">This matter involves a claim by longshoreman against a shipping company for injury sustained during the course upon loading a vessel in the Port of Philadelphia and in which, the shipowner inflated Atlantic and Gulf Stevedores whom I represent as a third-party defendant claiming indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.969" offset="335287">In briefest terms, these issues were tried in a 10-day trial before jury and the jury found in favor of the plaintiff, the injured longshoreman, against the shipowner on findings of unseaworthiness and also on findings of negligence and at the same time, in answer to a specific interrogatory found that the stevedore did not violate the terms of its contractual obligation to do its work in a reasonably safe, proper and workmanlike manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.969" offset="559208">Finding in the amount of $100,000 in favor of the plaintiff, judgment by the lower court was entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the shipowner and at the same time, judgment with respect to the indemnity action was entered in favor of the Stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.438" offset="661086">The shipowner appealed to the Third Circuit Court after its motions for judgment N.O.V. or for a new trial had been denied by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.861" offset="726810">And the Third Circuit Court in an opinion, April 7, 1961, affirmed plaintiff's judgment against the shipowner, but as to the indemnity action reversed the judgment of the lower trial court which had been entered upon the specific findings of the jury that the shipowner's fault did not arise out of any failure on the part of the stevedore to perform its work in accordance with its contractual obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.182" offset="904129">The Third Circuit Court, therefore, reversed the judgment and in its opinion in three separate places, holds that indemnity as a matter of law lies against the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.817" offset="974660">A petition for rehearing was filed on behalf of Atlantic and Gulf and the Third Circuit Court without opinion denied that petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.416" offset="1021053">A petition for certiorari was filed to this Honorable Court and this Court on October 16, 1961, granted the stevedore's petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.466" offset="1081240">I might say parenthetically that there was a companion petition for certiorari filed by the shipowner, challenging the validity of the Circuit Court's affirmance of the judgment in favor of the plaintiff and on the same day that this Honorable Court granted the stevedore's petition for certiorari, it denied the shipowner's petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.249" offset="1196387">Petition for certiorari in this case, before your Honorable Court, was to consider three basic questions and the subsidiary questions encompassed therein. The first question was whether or not a matter tried to a jury under a full and complete charge by the trial court which encompassed all the issues in the case whether or not, the Circuit Court by reversing the judgment entered upon that verdict was a violation of the second sentence of the Seventh Amendment which states in positive terms and no fact applied by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined by any court of the United States except in accordance with the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.002" offset="1475375">The second question we pose for consideration by this Honorable Court is whether or not in the presence of a contract, and I might say that in this case, starting on page 147 (a), Your Honors will see a contract which consumes seven printed pages prepared by the shipowner, entered into by the parties, a contract which spells out the intention intended by those parties, whether in the presence of such a contract, and in the presence of a jury finding, after a 10-day trial, after a full submission of all the issues by the trial court is charged to the jury, whether the Circuit Court erred in reversing the judgment entered in favor of the stevedore without reference to the contract and merely on the holding that if it was negligence for the shipowner and if the jury found negligence of the shipowner as a matter of law, the Court was bound to enter judgment for the shipowner on its indemnity action against the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.784" offset="1818520">The third question we pose to this Honorable Court is whether or not under this same circumstances, a court may do what the Third Circuit Court has done, namely to set aside the findings of a jury and a judgment entered thereon, without a plain showing as this Honorable Court has imposed as a prerequisite in the McAlister case, a showing that the jury verdict was clearly erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.160" offset="2352044">If Your Honors please, Leighton Beard, the longshoreman on July 1, 1955, was working in the hold of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.331" offset="2384645">The job at hand was to remove bales of burlap weighing approximately 1000 to 1100 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.132" offset="2415888">These bales of burlap were held together tightly by four metal bands approximately one inch in width.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.031" offset="2455489">Historically, and the evidence clearly demonstrates this, the means by which these bales are removed is to take a winch cable to which there's attached to large ring and to this ring are six long ropes, and to the end of each rope is what looks like a gigantic fishing hook with a flattened edge and the procedure by which cargo this time, under this record, clearly shows has always been done by this method in every port in United States and in Great Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.381" offset="2600939">We would place, our longshoreman would place two bands -- two hooks, under two bands of each bale and we would raise three bales at a time, because there are six cables, six hooks, two bands on each bale being used as the lifting device.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.071" offset="2691636">On the staple day, after three hours of operation, one of these drafts rose to a height of approximately 30 to 35 feet at which point, two bands on one bale broke.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.622" offset="2781811">It was a consignment from India.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.669" offset="2794036">It was not loaded by the stevedore involved in this case but by others under the control and under the direction of the ship as the evidence, Chief Mate Quinn shows.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="684.635" offset="2841893">Was in that respect, this was similar to the facts from the Waterman case where the cargo had been loaded in the Philippines.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis E. Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="695.357" offset="2884838">Yes, that is correct that the cargo in Waterman had been loaded in the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.920" offset="2907094">If Your Honor please in this case, we -- we take the position that there is more to our position just that someone else loaded this cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.457" offset="2949204">What happened was that once this bale fell, its truck cargo that was consigned to the Port of New York because when this vessel came to Philadelphia, any evidence supports this and shows as I think fairly conclusively, there were 63 tons of these bales destined for New York, immediately adjoining 100 tons of these bales destined to Philadelphia, stowed to an equal height.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.136" offset="3067904">And after the three hours of operation, the New York cargo was of course somewhat higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.407" offset="3089011">The evidence will show two tiers higher and these bales, I might say, are two feet, by three feet, by four feet, so that when this bale dropped, the evidence indicates that it was going up in a perfectly straight vertical lift and there is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.208" offset="3156198">The only witness who actually saw the bale after it began to rise, because obviously once the longshoreman helped bring this out to the center of the hatch and steady the load, they then go under the coaming to secure themselves from a possible fall of any type of cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.083" offset="3227669">The only witness who saw what happened once this bale started upward, testified on page 22 (b) of this record, that it came up perfectly straight, didn't hook onto anything, didn't bump into anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.335" offset="3300707">This bale then struck the New York cargo and careened off a distance estimated variably up to 12 to 25 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.569" offset="3341667">And Mr. Leighton Beard, following instructions given to him by his employer was then against the act bulkhead, that this was his day and this bale followed him right to that place and crushed it against the wall and he sustained very serious injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.614" offset="3421811">The first operation, he lost the leg below the knee, the second above the knee, and finally at the hip level and these were the injuries and the damages that were claimed.</text>

            <text syncTime="932.766" offset="3834441">The plaintiff's claim on the issue of unseaworthiness was, and there was expert evidence to support this theory by the way, that these bands for the purpose of this unloading, a matter which was known by Chief Mate Quinn and the vessel and this company, these bands became part of the ships unloading gear because there was no other way ever used to get these bales out.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.571" offset="3945618">And since the ship knew that these bales would have to be lifted out and pulled from tight stow by means of these bands and since Captain Arthur, a wit -- an expert of 35 years at sea, testified that this is the only way it could have been done since Chief Mate Quinn, the only witness who testified who was on board the ship on behalf of the Steamship Company testified he knew this was going to be the way, he knew no other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.917" offset="4063065">The theory was therefore, that once these bands broke for any reason, any absence of any evidence that they were rusted that they were worn, that they were -- had been badly used during the manu -- during the banding of them or during the loading of them, the unseaworthiness was the fact that the bands were a part of the ship's unloading gear and broke.</text>

            <text syncTime="1057.881" offset="4334947">As a matter of fact, the basic theory was that this Chief Mate testified that though he had been on vessels unloaded by my client for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.103" offset="4399835">Two hours before this accident and there had never been any complaint, never any comment about it before, no challenge to the method, five stevedores said, the only method they ever saw, the only method they knew, five experts said the same thing and not only that this is the costumer in method, but it was the safest possible method, a method in accordance with the Philadelphia Maritime Trade Association Regulations, the plaintiff alleged against the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.274" offset="4524492">You should not have permitted Atlantic and Gulf to unload this vessel if you, Mr. Quinn, Chief Mate knew that this method, though it may be the best, though it was proper, though it was reasonable, though it was workmanlike, in fact, you criticized this method as dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.805" offset="4622608">And an expert testified that you had the duty and the power to stop this operation and if in fact you had a better method, he talked about some method of using slings as they load them in India.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.505" offset="4677360">This is one of the basis upon which the plaintiff proceeded on negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.106" offset="4695751">If you, Quinn, thought this was dangerous, you are the Chief Mate, you stood there and watch this operation, and the evidence is clear, Chief Mate Quinn testified in a deposition before trial which is offered in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.504" offset="4749354">He stood there, and he watched them work and two hours before this accident it's inconceivable because that might seem to some of us, he calls the port manager, the man in-charge on the vessel and says, “This is a very dangerous method.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.147" offset="5831973">The first question was, was unseaworthiness of the defendant a substantial factor in causing injuries to the plaintiff and the jury said, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.640" offset="5881919">The second question was, was there negligence on the part of the shipowner, which was a substantial factor in causing injuries to the plaintiff and the jury again said, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.906" offset="5931029">The third question was, in what amount do you assess damages?</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.292" offset="5948583">The answer was $100,000 and now, we come to the crucial question which is before Your Honor, the fourth question to the jury was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.394" offset="5988916">“If you have answered 'yes' to questions one and two, did the fault of the shipowner, Ellerman Lines and the City Line Limited, arise out of any failure on the part of Atlantic and Gulf to do its work in accordance with its contractual obligations and the jury said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.808" offset="6086614">And the fifth question was, if you have answered question number four in the affirmative, was this breach of contract a substantial factor in causing injuries to the plaintiff, and obviously having question -- answered question number four in the negative, this was answered in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.590" offset="6161742">And it was on those specific findings of the jury, that Judge Ganey, now a circuit judge of the Third Circuit, entered judgment on behalf of the stevedore in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.137" offset="6203956">And it was the judgment entered upon those specific findings which Judge Kalodner swept aside and I submit so erroneously, because there were three other grounds of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.505" offset="6249409">Number one, that since the shipowner knew in fact that we had to lift these bales out, and since in fact it knew that it had cargo to go to New York and cargo to go to Philadelphia and that the ship would be in New York before it got to Philadelphia, it should not have stowed the New York cargo in such a manner that it was the impediment extending out into the square of the hatch so that when we operated in removing Philadelphia cargo, and the contract specifically says Philadelphia cargo, “No evidence would be at any right to touch that New York cargo.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.422" offset="6405099">They must have known that a hazardous condition could possibly result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.163" offset="6424012">This was strenuously argued by Mr. Browsky on behalf of the plaintiff in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.457" offset="6445223">This was a condition existed, committed preexisting before we ever entered upon that vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.994" offset="6467375">This was argued fully to the jury that they should've put the New York cargo on top, if in fact it had to be unloaded first or the Philadelphia cargo on top if in fact it had to be unloaded first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.534" offset="6521501">But to leave us with the situation where under our contract, we're obliged to go aboard that vessel and unload Philadelphia cargo, we were doing just that in a proper workmanlike manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1836.714" offset="7450206">McNamara said, “Even if there's negligence on the stevedore, even if it maybe a breach of that contract with the shipowner on whether indemnity is to be allowed, there may be conduct on the part of the shipowner which bars indemnity,” and that is an issue to be decided for the jury. We have said in our briefs, if Your Honors please, that this issue has caused great concern and great confusion among the courts because in the Fourth Circuit, in the case of (Inaudible), which are discussed in our brief, judges are trying to decide, well what is conduct, the absence of which will permit indemnity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3024.691" offset="12202088">Exactly, Your Honor but I believe that since you are concerned with the molding and creating of admiralty law, you are concerned with the – fashioning it in a way which will prevent accidents and that's my point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.508" offset="12249422">I think that there has been misinterpretation and confusion in the courts below and particularly in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in this case, insofar as the rules laid down in Ryan, Weyerhaeuser in particular and Crumady in particular are concerned in the field of maritime indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.292" offset="12336567">What has happened here, I do believe, is that the courts have shaped a rule which holds in essence that no matter what activity, innocent or otherwise, a stevedore has with a defective part of a ship, the shipowner will be entitled to indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.148" offset="12415979">Now this, I submit, is wrong because it will encourage shipowners to the -- continue to tender for loading and discharge unsafe equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.795" offset="12454536">It will absolve of them any responsibility for the gear and equipment on their ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.123" offset="12475852">I do believe that an equal responsibility should be shared by both shipowner and stevedore for safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.774" offset="12502497">Now, Congress has entered this field by a 1958 Amendment to the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act and vested in the Department of Labor Authority to promulgate rules and regulations in the longshore industry to promote health and safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.344" offset="12564773">But this doesn't mean, I suggest, that the Court should abdicate their traditional responsibility to promote safety too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.897" offset="12594970">And I suggest that a rule which grants indemnity where a stevedore has just any association, innocent or otherwise, with a defective part on the vessel, a defective vessel, a defective condition on a vessel, is a rule which increases accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.029" offset="12659440">It absolves the shipowner from the responsibility for safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.096" offset="12679711">We suggest that the confusion which has grown out of Crumady and Weyerhaeuser in particular should be clarified and what we propose is a rule which says in effect that indemnity shall be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.127" offset="12739897">In all cases where the substantial cause of the accident resulted in a foreseeable injury arising out of a substandard performance by the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.960" offset="12799248">In an area of activity where the stevedore's skill and competence should have been the major factor in preventing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.975" offset="12827251">In other cases, indemnity should be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.058" offset="12839581">We say that such a restatement or re-clarification of the rule in Weyerhaeuser and Crumady will place equal responsibility on shipowner for his equipment and equal responsibility on stevedore for his activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.444" offset="12925158">I say that Weyerhaeuser warned shipowners that you must be safe, when it used the term, you will be entitled to indemnity, absent conduct on your part sufficient to preclude it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.462" offset="12973223">This was a caveat it seems to me that unless you live up to recognize reasonable standards of safety, you shall be denied indemnity, but it seems to me that the lower courts in some instances have confused this and I think have confused it when Crumady came along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.305" offset="13040619">Crumady said that where a stevedore brings into play an unseaworthy condition, he shall be liable to the shipowner for indemnity, but it's important to note that in the Crumady decision, this Court observed that the primary cause of the accident was the negligence of the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.952" offset="13115225">Now here in this case, the court below apparently paid no attention to the fact that the jury found this stevedore free from negligence, the shipowner guilty of negligence and having -- and guilty of tendering an unseaworthy ship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.894" offset="13706951">That raises the question of whether there was a proper 50 (b) situation presented to the Court of Appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.223" offset="13752299">I would like to first say on this point, and this is, I'm addressing myself solely to the procedural point now, that there was here a request for, what we call in Pennsylvania a binding instruction, you will find it in the defendant's requests for charge, numbers 3 and 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.499" offset="13849370">We specifically asked the District Court at the end of our case or at the end of all evidence rather to direct a verdict in favor of Ellerman and against the Stevedoring Company, the third party defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.192" offset="13904123">There was no separate paper for a rule 50 (b) motion filed and if under Cone and the Johnson case, we must file a separate 50 (b) paper then the point is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.658" offset="13977997">The point raised in the petitioner's reply brief is correct because there was no 50 (b) as a separate motion paper filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.560" offset="14009657">We discussed -- we asked Judge Ganey for a directed verdict in writing and orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.073" offset="14047692">Now unfortunately, since this point was never raised either on the post-trial motion arguments before the Court of Appeals or in the petitioner's petition for rehearing before the Court of Appeals or in this Court -- in the petition for certiorari to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.245" offset="14144345">No one has printed specifically that portion of the record, in Third Circuit, we used an appendix system, no one printed those portions of the record where that was, but for example, at page 1140 of the original record, the statement appears by myself, if the defendant is liable on that basis, I think that is the clearest kind of a case for an award of indemnity over, and that is in the discussions among counsel immediately preceding the charge of Judge Ganey to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.315" offset="14300662">Again, at page 100 -- or 1113 of the original record, and again unfortunately not printed for this Court, I say, “Judge Ganey, I made a motion at the end of the plaintiff's case and I have handed it a written motion for binding instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.829" offset="14362728">I renew the request but I am also 21 years old plus and I know that with the attitude of the Court of Appeals, I'm wasting my breath.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3600.489" offset="14505357">Sir, they add up to this that there was a written request for a directed verdict for us, we in Pennsylvania called it a point for binding instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.880" offset="14546944">The point of the decisions of this Court in Johnson and in Cone versus West Virginia Pulp and Paper seems to be that you have to call this matter to the attention of the district judge so that he will know what you want and he will have an opportunity to rule, consider and pass upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.011" offset="14631372">And I'm simply pointing out to this Court that that was done in this case and that there was a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.637" offset="14681945">And I am pointing to the fact that before the District Court on the post-trial arguments, it was said in the written briefs that this was the -- a 50 (b) motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.468" offset="14761253">So that I think sir that on that record, we may not -- let me put it this way, that I don't think it is the practice in Pennsylvania or the lawyers from Pennsylvania who practice before the federal court nor is it the practice in the federal court sitting in Pennsylvania to file a separate paper called a 50 (b) motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.817" offset="14854666">We file a request for binding instructions and we file a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict -- after a verdict has been entered and those are argued and this was clearly, forcefully argued to Judge Ganey on the post-trial motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.208" offset="14920182">It was called at that point, a point preserved under Rule 50 (b) and it was specifically so stated in the briefs and not controverted by the petitioner until Friday of last week.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.087" offset="14971695">Therefore, the Court of Appeals as we say was really exercising the judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.896" offset="15002937">It held that there was error in the District Court and that the District Court should have directed a verdict in favor of Ellerman and against Atlantic and Gulf at the trial stage and it therefore entered that verdict following appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.358" offset="15084753">I really point this out because I don't want this case to go off on this procedural point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.292" offset="15104502">The -- unfortunately, we did not have a chance to brief it because it was not raised, but that is the posture of it and I think that we fall outside the scope of the Cone and the Johnson decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.468" offset="15169285">And now, I would like to address myself to the case as it comes to this Court as I see it on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.161" offset="15203976">I listened rather carefully to my opponent's argument and it seemed to me that we did not have presented the case in the posture which it is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.353" offset="15256743">When the Court looks at the record and if the Court has the appendices before -- the record before it, you will see the type of operation which was going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.003" offset="15299375">There are photographs taken at later dates of hooks and bales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.246" offset="15324348">The stow, and the record is perfectly clear that this was all tightly stowed cargo, and as Mr. Justice Stewart suggested in one of his questions earlier, it had to be pulled out of this tight stow by these two hooks in each of two bands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.430" offset="15401044">Now, there were four bands, a minimum of four bands on each bale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.378" offset="15428838">There was no effort made by the stevedoring company, having pulled the bale out of its tight place in stow and dragged it and drag is the word used by the longshoreman witnesses at page 25 (a) of this record, dragged across the space till -- it was underneath the point from which it was to be lifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.103" offset="15511803">There was no effort made at that point to see whether damage had been done to this part of the packaging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.354" offset="15544822">There was no effort made to take the hook out from under the two straps which had been used in the dragging operation and put them under the two hooks which had not been subjective to that strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.079" offset="15599679">It was after all that had taken place that this bale being hoisted out first one band broke and the second weight was all thrown on -- on a single band, it then broke and the bale fell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.825" offset="15650670">It struck a ledge of cargo remaining in the hole and I think that part is clear and it rebounded and struck this longshoreman causing him injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3919.792" offset="15782536">The Court first submitted an issue of whether this was -- the ship was unseaworthy as to cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.104" offset="15803747">Now, the Court of Appeals said, “We don't approve or we're going to follow the First -- Second Circuit's decision in another case and not extend the shipowner's -- the common carriers warranty as to the packaging around cargo.</text>

            <text syncTime="3944.997" offset="15883368">Then the Court of Appeals looked to what issues had been submitted to this jury for jury determination by the charge of the court to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="4061.481" offset="16349288">That's why you have ships break at sea.</text>

            <text syncTime="4186.863" offset="16850840">Now that was a charge -- in the charge of the jury, that was a point submitted under which the Court said to the jury, “You may find the shipowner negligent not for the way in which it was originally stowed there but for not shifting it or putting it out of the way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.192" offset="16960136">That was a -- once you get the jury's answer to the unseaworthiness question and focus on the negligence question in this case, you find that there were three varies of negligence submitted to the jury by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.131" offset="17043937">One is this failure to put out of the way.</text>

            <text syncTime="4271.581" offset="17189700">The Court of Appeals examining the charge said this, “The answer to the -- or of the jury to the interrogatory dealing with the stevedore, all that demonstrates is that the stevedore did not create the condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.600" offset="17281755">Now, that is the language in which the district judge submitted the D1 versus D2 situation to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.965" offset="17323238">Did anything that Atlantic and Gulf do create the situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.677" offset="17346121">They ruled out or that language ruled out the whole theory of this Court's decision in Crumady versus The Joachim Fisser where you said that it operated upon it a condition preexisting and brought it into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.235" offset="17416338">Now, that was specifically called the attention of the trial judge that that language of his charge ruled that out but we -- all we have is an exception which the charge was not corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.335" offset="17460746">So that the Court of Appeals examining the issues which the charge submitted to the jury found that the answer of the jury to that interrogatory didn't cover the whole situation because it only covered the one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.571" offset="17537651">It then examined point-by-point each one of the three negligence theories of plaintiff versus Ellerman and it found that as to each, there would necessarily have to be an indemnification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.758" offset="17602435">In other words, if the Ellerman -- I'm sorry if Atlantic and Gulf's method of working was wrong, you could not hold Ellerman liable to the plaintiff without at the same time as a matter of law, graving Ellerman indemnity against the actor, the person who was utilizing the unsafe method.</text>
