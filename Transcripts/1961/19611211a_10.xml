            <text syncTime="38.961" offset="259218">I chose that count because it does not involve petitioner's main First Amendment contention that he could not be forced to disclose names because it does not present the problem of temporal remoteness that the petitioner raises and because it does not present any problem of pertinency to an inquiry into Communist infiltration of news media.</text>

            <text syncTime="71.179" offset="388054">It appears in the joint appendix at page 5, that's the large blue document.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.302" offset="420551">Now, on arguing that, the Government had fully proved the subject under inquiry, I described to the Court the nature of the proceedings, the remarks of the Chairman and of Senator Hennings and of the character of the questioning of petitioner all of which establish beyond doubt that the subject was Communist infiltration into news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.073" offset="495679">Incidentally, I should like to observe in this connection that most of what I said is fully applicable to the Shelton and Price cases which arose out of the very same hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.579" offset="537684">I also argued that while the petitioner did not raise any objections either in the area of the subject matter or the pertinency of the questions that he was fully apprised to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.683" offset="586062">Now, in order to be certain that I reach the matter, I should like now to cover the point raised by Mr. Justice Black on Thursday, and that is, the balance that is to be struck under the First Amendment and under the Barenblatt case between the governmental interest and the private interest that is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.579" offset="665684">In cases such as these, where there is an undoubted interference with the individual's right to be left alone, I shall continue to limit my primary focus on Count 7 since an affirmance on that count alone will sustain the sentence imposed by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.997" offset="743320">The importance of the governmental interest involved in the conduct of investigations of Communist activity in this country has been fully explained in this Court's opinion in the Barenblatt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.590" offset="797759">That interest was there held to be paramount even with respect to lawful activities for, as the Court pointed out, of necessity the investigating process, investigatory process must proceed step by step.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.534" offset="861497">That governmental interest was there held to be paramount even with respect to an area as sensitive as education.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.249" offset="892322">An educational institution, said to the Court, is not a constitutional sanctuary from inquiry and surely, the pressroom is not in a more favored room -- it is not in a more favored position than the classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.086" offset="951672">That governmental interest was there held to be paramount even with respect to so-called associational activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.865" offset="982810">In short, the governmental interest here is in no sense less compelling than it was in the Barenblatt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.979" offset="1015306">Now of course, it is relevant in balancing the competing public and private interests that are involved in case --</text>

            <text syncTime="255.054" offset="1123558">I presume you would have to balance the Government's interest getting this particular information, this particular power in connection with its prospects in passage of the law against private interest of the man plus the Government's interest in seeing that laws do not interfere with the rights of associations, and expressions and beliefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.848" offset="1214777">Yes sir and I should now like to focus more particularly on the information that the governmental interest was directed to in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.034" offset="1263470">It is relevant of course in balancing the competing public and private interest to consider what information of value the subcommittee might have elicited by a frank answer to the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.368" offset="1312893">Now focusing again on the question involved in Count 7, the Chairman of the Senate Internal Security subcommittee had indicated that the subcommittee had information that there was a Communist newspaper cell still in operation in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.680" offset="1382066">When the petitioner was asked whether the New York Herald Tribune cell to which he had belonged was still in existence, he stated that he did not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.245" offset="1420309">He was then asked the question on which Count 7 is based, a question that would obviously have thrown some light on that subject and that is whether any of its fellow members of that cell as of 1948 were still with the Herald Tribune.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.064" offset="1475584">Now, a negative answer would've provided a strong, albeit not conclusive indication that the existing cell was not in the New York Herald Tribune and perhaps the subcommittee would, on the basis of that information have held justified in concentrating its investigatory efforts elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.992" offset="1555310">An affirmative answer, would have confirm the subcommittee and the possibility that the existing cell was in the Herald Tribune and as I've indicated would have lay a foundation for a number of additional questions such as whether any of these persons who were in that cell in 1948 and still with the Herald Tribune, whether any of them were to petitioner's knowledge members of the communist party, what their numbers were that is to say how many of them there were, what their party functions were and whether or not, they had any supervisory or policy functions with the newspaper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.376" offset="4532851">Your Honor, at each stage of this proceeding, the Government has relied on a different question or group of questions to sustain the verdict below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.226" offset="4564302">Here, it relies on Count 7 and I would make two observations with respect to that particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.681" offset="4594082">The first is what to question is not have the Committee inquired of the petitioner do you know whether or not there are presently any communists employed at the Herald Tribune?</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.006" offset="4639431">The petitioner would almost certainly have answered the question and almost equally certainly would have answered it no because he left the party some eight years before he left the Herald Tribune five years before and such a question would not be a question that sought the identification of any person who had been associated within the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.020" offset="4719470">This question while couched in present terms is actually an effort to go back once more to the time when he was in the Communist Party in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.650" offset="4761997">The second observation I would make is that the petitioner had made it entirely clear to the Committee by the most exact statement that he would answer any questions asked in of the Committee -- by the Committee except questions which sought names.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.126" offset="4819884">Now, if the purpose of this question was something other than to seek names, and I suggest that a reasonable witness would conclude that it was a question which was designed to elicit names then it would seem to me that in common fairness, the Committee should have informed petitioner that that was not the question, not the purpose of asking a question, but they did not go -- intend to go on and ask the obvious next question namely, who are those persons and the rest of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.063" offset="4931584">I think it was no under -- misunderstanding on this matter either by the members of the Committee or by the petitioner and I think that any explication of the purpose of the question, if it was other than to seek the naming of names was due to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.484" offset="4997308">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
