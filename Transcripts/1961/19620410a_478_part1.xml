            <label>Mr. Fred Okrand</label>
            <text syncTime="16.818" offset="170611">May it please the Court, Mr. Patterson.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.209" offset="188165">The case before this Court involves two counts of a 35-count indictment which was tried in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.073" offset="239679">The two counts involved identical questions which, in the view of the petitioner, are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.212" offset="268204">One, whether or not the act done by the petitioner amounted to forgery as a matter of law and, two, whether or not there is sufficient evidence to sustain the judgment of the trial court and the affirmance by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.460" offset="349184">The case arose when a warrant for the arrest of petitioner was issued by the commissioner in Los Angeles, charging a violation of 18 USC 495, for the forgery of one check, that check being the subject of what is now Count 22 of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.997" offset="439359">This was in January of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.682" offset="454092">After a -- an extensive search of the premises of the petitioner, numerous documents and files were taken and a suit -- and an indictment was issued in May of 1959, charging 22 counts of violations of various offenses, violation of false income tax returns or others, forgery counts, and violation of 18 USC 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.756" offset="574360">Thereafter, in August of 1959, a superseding indictment was issued, charging 25 counts, the additional 13 -- there being -- 13 additional counts added to the first indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.958" offset="639248">The petitioner was found guilty of 31 of the 35 counts and acquitted of 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.018" offset="671431">Among the 31 were the two forgery counts involved in this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.244" offset="692328">Thereafter, on appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded 29 of the 31 counts on the ground that the evidence obtained have been the subject of an illegal search and seizure contrary to the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.064" offset="763591">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the 2 counts which are present before this Court, namely, Counts 21 and Counts 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.533" offset="805491">The counts are identical and they charge a violation of 18 USC 495.Had the case been tried in the other counts?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="fred_okrand" startTime="186.410" stopTime="578.516">
            <label>Mr. Fred Okrand</label>
            <text syncTime="186.410" offset="849063">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.553" offset="857631">Following the decision by the Ninth Circuit, we took the petition here and the matter has not yet gone back.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.941" offset="891173">Among the counts that were reversed, however, there are counts which are similar in legal import to the two which are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.926" offset="939029">Counts 21 and 22 which are on page 11 of the record, charge in simple and concise language a violation of 18 USC 1495 and charge that on or about a certain date, the defendant knowingly and willfully forged on two, in the two counts, United States Government checks, the endorsement and the signatures of the payees, Daniel H. and Charlene R. Bartfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.281" offset="1080508">Now, Your Honors, in the record -- in the printed record which is before you, at pages 83 and 87, our photostatic copies are pictures of the two checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.779" offset="1162533">It is alleged that the petitioner forged.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.833" offset="1190745">When the -- we, on behalf of the petitioner, designated to a -- for the purposes of the printed record, these two checks and the other three exhibits which are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.924" offset="1239019">And we're informed by the clerk of this Court that they couldn't find the -- or that the -- these two checks, 31 and 32 which are on page 83 and 87, had not arrived with the bunch of exhibits which had come from the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.395" offset="1312998">And, efforts were made to locate these original checks without success except as I shall explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.088" offset="1351764">When neither the clerk of the court below could find the original exhibits nor the clerk of the District Court in Los Angeles, a photostatic copy of each of the checks was obtained from the Internal Revenue Service in Los Angeles and forwarded to this Court via the District Court clerk and the Court of Appeals and then here.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.016" offset="1447476">And so, the pictures that appear here at pages 83 and 87 are pictures of a picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.702" offset="1486137">Mr. Dorn, my colleague, arrived here early last Friday and went through the exhibits in the exhibit room downstairs and I, yesterday, went through them, and I don't know what the reason was, but the two exhibits are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.328" offset="1544652">The two original Exhibits, 31 and 32 are present and the clerk advises me that they are in the room where the exhibits are kept for the use of the -- of the justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.545" offset="1593553">And, I would ask that when the Court is considering the case, if it would please, look at the original Exhibits 31 and 32 which are present, the original checks, for the reasons that I shall explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.332" offset="1660740">It is our contention, number one, that there is no forgery for the reason that forgery, under Section 495 of Title 18, means forgery in the usual and ordinary way that people understand it to mean namely, a coming off, a representation that something is done by someone else and not done really by the person who is doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.615" offset="1789785">Now, on pages 83 and 87 of the record are the two checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.883" offset="1814862">And if Your Honors will notice, on the front side of the check, they are made out with -- one of them has two inaccuracies in spelling which are of (Inaudible), are made out to Daniel H. &amp; Charlene R. Bartfield c/o R. Milo Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.538" offset="1889573">Oh, I want to make one other statement before I discuss this.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.012" offset="1911411">In the trial court, and certainly in the Court of Appeals where I had personal knowledge, it was the view of everyone concerned that the endorsements which appeared on the back of these checks were -- had the word “by” in front of the word “R. Milo Gilbert,” so that it was considered by all the courts and the parties, in our view, that the endorsements read, "Daniel H. Bartfield, Charlene R. Bartfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.690" offset="2042128">By R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee."</text>
            <text syncTime="489.138" offset="2059891">This is the way the case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.098" offset="2067728">This is the -- certainly the way it was considered in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.817" offset="2086640">As Your Honors will note on the picture that's on pages 83 and 87 and as the original do show upon more careful examination by me and Mr. Dorn yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.725" offset="2134288">There is no word “by” in front of the endorsement.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.015" offset="2151424">In our view of the law, however, this makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.995" offset="2163336">Let me continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.381" offset="2172844">The front part of the check says, "Daniel H. &amp; Charlene R. Bartfield c/o R. Milo Gilbert," that is -- those are the payees.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.612" offset="2205863">And on the reverse side of the check, the endorsements are, "Daniel R. Bartfield, Charlene R. Bartfield, R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee."</text>
            <text syncTime="538.709" offset="2258213">The reason I ask the Court to examine the originals of the checks, Exhibits 31 and 32 which are in the record and in the Exhibit 5, is because an examination of the endorsements will show that they all are all written in the same handwriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.052" offset="2331564">There is no attempt to make a different kind of a signature for the named payees.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.757" offset="2362389">It seems to us clear, that any one who looks at the endorsements can see that they are made by the same person and of course when the case was tried, it was stipulated that the endorsements were by the same person.</text>

Milo Gilbert," taken in conjunction with the fact that the handwriting is all in the same name, that that shows to all the world that R.

            <text syncTime="874.271" offset="3600488">And, in our view of the law, both at common law, we think is very clear and the overwhelming weight of authority in both the federal and the state courts, as we've tried to emphasize in our briefs, is to the effect that that is not -- is not forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.863" offset="3678856">In other words, we think that the statute means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.256" offset="3696410">When it said forgery, that's what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.446" offset="3709158">And, the Government has attempted to say, well, it's a broad statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.914" offset="3730996">It tries to cover frauds against the Government and therefore, it should broadly construe.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.152" offset="3751999">Indeed, they agreed that we correctly state what the majority view of the law is, and they agree that most courts, in fact, I hesitate to say but I haven't been able to find a single court which has said that a -- an endorsement made in a representative capacity so as it -- so as to be shown at the last signer is signing the first name, I've been able to find no court which had said that is a forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.254" offset="3880417">There have been cases around the question, but not that specific question, and all the cases that we've been able to find have all been to the effect that that kind of a representative signature does not constitute forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.452" offset="3941230">But, as I say, the Government suggests that this is a very broad statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.805" offset="3958575">It's a fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.162" offset="3967979">And so, if he didn't have the authority which, for the purpose of my argument at the moment, we are conceding, but I will get to it -- that question a little bit later.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.793" offset="4042585">And, as I say, in our view, it's a simple question of what is forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.707" offset="4062229">We think a common law forgery meant a palming off.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.396" offset="4076962">We think the over palming weight of authority, statewide, it means the same thing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred Okrand</label>
            <text syncTime="1096.503" offset="4489383">There are numerous statutes dealing with forgery in various specific instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.017" offset="4523447">In the chapter in which 18 USC 1001 is located, there are, I think, some half-a-dozen statutes which, in language similar to this, make it a crime to present a false, forged, altered, counterfeited instrument to the Federal Housing Agency into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and various specific kinds of documents which are to be presented and using much the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.798" offset="4666598">But Congress, of course, as we say, knew what it was doing when it said forgery, and it meant forgery as everybody understands it to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.691" offset="4722186">I might say, although I don't think it's important and necessary for the petitioner to say in order to prevail, that there is no problem about a man going free, if he should do something as charged here on the ground that there's no statute to cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.712" offset="4794180">In fact, there's a much broader statute which does cover various kinds of frauds which probably would cover this sort of a situation and 18 USC 1001, under which statute the Government also charged to petitioner in two or three counts in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.552" offset="4873592">On Page -- on pages 9 and 10, in counts 18, 19, and 20, the Government charged violation of 18 USC 1001, so that there -- if there is a fear, and I say this should not bear any weight at all in the question of whether or not what petitioner did to violate 495.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.273" offset="4988426">But if there is a fear that in some way, someone will get away with something, providing the facts are there, there's no cause for that because other statutes are present in which Congress obviously intended to cover other situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.735" offset="5074317">There is one more argument that I think I should cover before I conclude with this point and that is the argument that is made by the Government posited upon the -- a position taken by the Court of Appeals, namely, that the word “R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee” is a fictitious person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.266" offset="5180479">Now, in our view, this is not a permissible argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.712" offset="5202213">We say that “R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee,” is not a fictitious person and that it tells to the casher of the check precisely and exactly the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.049" offset="5247561">Assuming for a moment and the facts in the case do not bear this out, assuming for the moment that the petitioner had absolutely no right at all to this check and no right at all to the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.301" offset="5312554">Nevertheless, the endorsement “R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee” correctly states his capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.477" offset="5345259">This is particularly emphasized in this record because of the definition that was given by the court to the jury, if we are to accept it here, as to what a trustee is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.799" offset="5418611">And, the court told the jury that trustee meant one and trusted with the property of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.098" offset="5451734">Now, of course, that's exactly what the petitioner was saying here, namely, if the facts were such, “I have the property of somebody else.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.929" offset="5491127">Now, persons can become involuntary trustees, persons can become trustees whether they want to or not, and so when a person signs a check in this way, he is saying, "This is not my money and I am -- I am the one who is signing this and holding to somebody else's money.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.866" offset="5570853">So, on that ground, we think that the judgment below is erroneous, that this is not a fictitious person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.827" offset="5602722">But this is only an additional argument to our other one, namely, that the word "trustee" shows that the petitioner is signing in a representative capacity, so that, on two grounds, we think that forgery is not shown here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1923.933" offset="7799097">But here, is what we -- here, what we have is an acknowledgment which is a different kind of a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.265" offset="7820413">In other words, very often, as in California, a person signs a power of attorney and he may or may not get it acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.139" offset="7855940">And then, he goes to a notary public and the notary public acknowledges that he said that he signed it, you see, not that he signed it in my presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.070" offset="7895646">And it's our view that the Bartfields, if this were not their signature, they would've certainly said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.116" offset="7939845">And if I may say so, having had experience with the efficient Office of the United States Attorney in Los Angeles, if there were any question at all -- any question at all as to whether or not these were the signatures of Mr. and Mrs. Bartfield, the handwriting expert would've been there in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.343" offset="8008704">There just can't be any question that these were the signatures of the Bartfields.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.380" offset="8024900">Now, the only other thing then is, is as suggested by the Court of Appeals and as taken on by the Government, well, then, maybe it was presented in blank or maybe it was another document that they were told that they were going to sign or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.942" offset="8107133">This is conjecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.084" offset="8111731">This is not evidence and we strongly urge that, certainly in a criminal case, that this is not enough evidence to show that he did not have the actual written authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.225" offset="8168260">Now, the only, the only instructions that were given on the question of forgery in this case were three, maybe two-and-a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.719" offset="8246209">On page 71 of the record, the court read 18 USC 495.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.087" offset="8291767">And then, at page 75 of the record, the court gave these two -- these two instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.110" offset="8319770">I really think they are only one instruction that where a tax account represents a taxpayer, gets no particular authority there from and has to be judged by the rules of everyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.224" offset="8360312">And then this one, also a power of attorney, which apparently the court considered to be in the case, to prosecute a claim against the Government giving authority to receive a check in payment, gives the agent no power to endorse and collect the check, but this authority maybe given either written or orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.960" offset="8439202">Well, the power of attorney gives much more than the power to receive a check, one parenthetical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.024" offset="8479431">The Court of Appeals also suggested and the Government agrees that perhaps the word “endorse,” which is inserted by way of a little carrot, as Your Honors will see in the copy attached to the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.584" offset="8529690">It doesn't appear on the printed part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.122" offset="8535855">It was added afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.898" offset="8542960">Well again, this is just conjecture and our view is that whether it was put in afterwards or not put in at all doesn't make any difference because the power of attorney was so broad that it would covert the right to endorse and even collect the check.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kirby W. Patterson</label>
            <text syncTime="2551.215" offset="10308211">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.890" offset="10330885">As we view this case, there is basically one question presented by the facts and that is simply why the evidence sustained petitioner's conviction for violation of 18 USC 495.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.325" offset="10392639">That, however, subdivides itself into two further questions, whether the evidence, viewing certain facts and certain remarks by the Court of Appeals, is sufficient which has been argued partially orally and partially by briefs in this case, sustained the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.624" offset="10481873">And secondly, the legal question whether this form of an endorsement constitutes a forgery within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.237" offset="10516355">Now, I apprehend that the Court is interested in the legal question rather than the particular factual questions presented by this case, and which has yet have not been fully argued but which are in petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.281" offset="10580511">I would like, however, to, first, clear the path as to the factual questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.088" offset="10615724">And later on, I will discuss the legal questions because there will of course be no opportunity to reply anything that is said hereafter on these factual questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.697" offset="10654177">So, let's get a little or full picture of what the facts in this case are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.045" offset="10691584">The only counts remaining before this Court placed are counts 21 and 22 of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.708" offset="10722200">Count 21 charges that on June 2, 1958, the petitioner forged a certain United States Government check payable to the -- to Charlotte -- he forged the names of Daniel H. and Charline R. Bartfield to a certain United States Government check in the amount of $800, first obtaining that money from United States Government, its officers and agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.892" offset="10842990">Count 22 makes similar charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.322" offset="10860648">The only difference is the amount of the check is $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.264" offset="10884472">The evidence on behalf of the Government supporting these counts was fairly brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.614" offset="10921880">The only witnesses to testify for the Government were the two Bartfields and they both testified substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.733" offset="10954271">They said that they employed petitioner, who is a tax accountant or a certified public accountant who does that kind of work to assist them in preparing their 1955 and 1956 income tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.149" offset="11019995">They did not authorize him, to their knowledge at least, to collect any refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.830" offset="11042670">They did not constitute him their attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.800" offset="11054582">They did not constitute him their trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.405" offset="11072972">The Government started to show Mr. Bartfield one of these checks and ask him whether the endorsement on the back was his.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.492" offset="11105364">At that point, defense attorney said that, in order to save time, it would be stipulated that all endorsements on the back of both checks were made in the hand of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.473" offset="11161266">So, that element of the case was out for these two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.448" offset="11193135">Now, the real issue of fact came up on this power of attorney which was shown to the Bartfields by defense counsel on cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.751" offset="11246425">We have set forth this power of attorney as it was originally written, a photostatic copy of it, as an appendix to our Government's brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.672" offset="11298043">It might pay to spend just a couple of minutes looking at that power of attorney so we won't have to go back at -- to it any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.170" offset="11376097">The form of it is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.477" offset="11381321">The Bartfields, as grantors, named petitioner their attorney for these purposes, which is written in the hand of petitioner, “For all matters pertaining to our Federal and California State income taxes and tax returns for the calendar years 1954 to 1959 inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.562" offset="11457599">This includes the filing and signing of tax returns and all of the necessary forms such as extension of time, etcetera, and the filing of necessary refund claims and receiving, depositing, endorsing, which of course appears above the carat, and otherwise negotiating such refund checks at his sole discretion including the right of offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.394" offset="11552998">Furthermore, to make any compromises and settlements at his sole discretion as he sees fit and proper, furthermore, to perform any further act as he may deem necessary under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.427" offset="11617050">We further agree to hold said R. Milo Gilbert harmless for any and all acts committed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.178" offset="11648084">The signatures purport to be Daniel H. Bartfield, Charline R. Bartfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.119" offset="11675878">They're both asked as to their signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.062" offset="11687581">They both thought that looked like their respective signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.194" offset="11704195">They weren't absolutely positive about it but they thought it looked like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.347" offset="11724779">Now, they didn't recall having signed that -- this paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.801" offset="11738572">They didn't recall having constituted petitioner as their attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.766" offset="11758425">The whole thing was new to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.692" offset="11770128">Insofar as any tax refund was concerned, they didn't know they had any tax refund coming back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.016" offset="11791444">They never knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.111" offset="11795832">The only thing, apparently, that informed them of this tax refund was when government men came around and showed them these checks and asked them whether or not those were their signatures on the endorsements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3070.837" offset="12386722">The language of the Court of Appeals, I was going to come to that soon because I'm sure that will be a verdict too on the final argument here about what the Court of Appeals said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.621" offset="12421831">The Court of Appeals language was rather -- was rather sketchy on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.479" offset="12437295">They said that it didn't appear -- well, let me see what was their language?</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.177" offset="12464044">I was going to come to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.132" offset="12467911">They said, “There being no proof of authority in writing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.716" offset="12482226">That's what they said on their original opinion and then it was pointed out to them that they were inaccurate in that statement, and they amended it by saying, “There being no adequate or convincing proof of authority in writing,” which as I will get to in a moment, were still not completely accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.995" offset="12559339">But, that's not the real issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.903" offset="12575013">Let me point out, before we fold up the power of attorney or, of course, the Court may wish to keep it up there, but the acknowledgment here by the wife of the petitioner in which, as I observed the acknowledgment, it doesn't bear a notarial seal but bears everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.625" offset="12685876">They didn't know anything about that acknowledgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.589" offset="12693713">They didn't remember at all that they'd ever told Mrs. Gilbert or anybody else that this was their free act indeed, and Mrs. Gilbert didn't appear as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.544" offset="12749511">Now, before we get on to this matter which Your Honor brought up, let me mention what the petitioner said about this whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.361" offset="12784828">Now, he testified, first, generally as to what his practice was and he said he always required of his clients that they sign powers of attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.187" offset="12828087">And that when the refund checks would come in, it was his practice to deposit those checks to his trustee's account and he would keep them there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.757" offset="12866435">He said he wouldn't immediately notify the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.977" offset="12875316">He'd keep them there usually until about December because the Government might want part of that money back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.694" offset="12906141">Now, he wasn't too clear, as I read the record, as to exactly what happened about this particular power of attorney, though I think his intent was to say that on April 10, this was all prepared in this form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.534" offset="12985553">He read it all over to the Bartfields and they signed it at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.356" offset="13004779">It would be difficult to hold him of a forgery charge because his language is indefinite enough on that point that you would have some difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.778" offset="13038529">But I think that was his intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.267" offset="13048456">He is trying to say that, that everything was in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.939" offset="13063084">They did sign this, just as is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.099" offset="13071757">They knew all of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.690" offset="13082102">There was, thus, a square conflict of testimony as to what the real facts were, whether there was really a knowing, conferring of the power of attorney by the Bartfields to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.791" offset="13166529">The court submitted this thing to the jury, first, as has been stated by reading the statute and then sets the execution of the endorsements by petitioner had been admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.731" offset="13230268">The only really substantial question which remained was the question of authority and that was submitted by the court's instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.852" offset="13266735">I think a little sketchily, if I may say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.826" offset="13278647">However, no objection was made at that time or later so far as that is concerned to the form of the instructions, so that is not really in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.054" offset="13319607">The real thing which the jury had to determine was did or did not the Bartfields confer, either orally or by this writing, a power on the petitioner to accept these checks and to endorse them and place them in his account, or perhaps they should leave out that last, simply a power to endorse them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.023" offset="13407483">That question, the jury resolved in favor of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.360" offset="13444786">They accepted the testimony of the Bartfields.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.815" offset="13454608">They rejected the testimony of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.698" offset="13470177">The Court of Appeals, reviewing the case, said it was a clear question of credibility of witnesses which was determinable by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.783" offset="13514480">If the court had stopped right there, its position would've been absolutely unassailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.430" offset="13537050">But as Mr. Justice Stewart has pointed out, they went on and said more, as court sometimes make a mistake of doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.459" offset="13569233">They said, “There being no proof of authority in writing” and, as I heretofore mentioned, it was pointed out on motion for rehearing, there was a proof, this power of attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.943" offset="13635166">And so they interlined, there was no adequate or convincing proof of authority in writing, still not quite filling the bill because whatever is adequate or convincing was not for the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.055" offset="13687620">That was for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.661" offset="13693994">But reading what the Court of Appeals said altogether, what it intended to say, and which is fairly inferable from all its language is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.144" offset="13731924">That there is a fact question here, a dispute in evidence, and there is no admitted writing which compelled the jury or the court as a matter of law to say that power had been conferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.812" offset="13802663">There was, we concede, inaccuracy in the language of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.955" offset="13827218">That, however, does not call for reversal of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.353" offset="13844773">Now, the Court of Appeals further went ahead on the motion for rehearing and said another thing that they didn't need to say, and which I think was inaccurate and correctly called inaccurate by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.700" offset="13906213">They refer to substantial evidence to support the fraudulent returns which were the basis of the refunds and the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.493" offset="13945396">Well, there was evidence to support the fraudulent nature of the returns -- returns in the other counts, but there wasn't on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.343" offset="13984789">In the interim between argument and motion for rehearing, the court had forgotten just exactly what were the facts and was slightly inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.081" offset="14015718">It was wholly inaccurate, but it was unnecessary to the decisions on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.034" offset="14043512">And again, we can throw the language of the court out but we still have its judgment on a matter of disputed facts in which they said it was not their author -- it was not their -- within the scope of their authority to review the factual finding of the jury and of course, such as this situation, before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.298" offset="14144554">Now, there are other things which maybe mentioned that they also said in that motion for rehearing judgment, they kind of turned over in their own mind some of the things that might have been in the minds of the jury when they accepted the Bartfields' version rather than accepting the petitioner's version.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.252" offset="14248417">And petitioner now calls that speculation, but that is simply a recapitulation by the Court of Appeals of factual considerations which the jury may have well considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.738" offset="14306304">It wasn't the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.544" offset="14313514">It was simply a consideration of things which could support the jury's finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.353" offset="14340786">So as we see the factual part of this case and the objections to the court's statements can very well be resolved by this Court in a few words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.567" offset="14401599">This is simply a question whether or not the Bartfields knowingly conferred power of attorney to the petitioner to accept and receive these checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.953" offset="14455202">Now, it doesn't -- it isn't shown anywhere definitely in the record about what happened to this money, except this one thing which has been mentioned to both of us that it went into this account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.898" offset="14511000">It was there for a period of several months, we don't know exactly how long.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.794" offset="14534510">The Bartfields never knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.693" offset="14546108">The petitioner had it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.683" offset="14554154">The question is simply whether or not he forged their endorsements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.719" offset="14578291">We come, therefore, the primary question in this case which is whether or not the endorsements herein constitute forgery especially within the meaning of this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.632" offset="14637850">Now, originally, is it whether or not a question presented by this case because the petition filed in this Court said that the endorsement was in this form on both checks, “Daniel H. and Charline R. Bartfield by R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.573" offset="14737638">The checks themselves were not before us, but the Court of Appeals had said that was the language of the endorsement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.084" offset="14779747">The Government brief below said that was the language of the endorsement, and the Government in its brief and our position herein, saying that everybody agreed that was the language, assumed such to be the case and our brief and our position was framed on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.514" offset="14861458">Now, had the endorsement been in that form by R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee, there is a clear showing on the face of the endorsement that the foregoing signatures were made by R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.508" offset="14945364">And, the majority holding or the American courts is at such an endorsement does not constitute forgery, as it is generally understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.672" offset="15002102">So there is certainly no feeling that the court had this devote in anyway when it grant a certiorari in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.416" offset="15041076">It was a case which seemed to call for it, but those don't seem to be the facts at all.Here is nothing further which I think should be explained to the Court, so as you will understand the briefs that both parties have filed in this case, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.795" offset="15126549">That following the grant of the clerk of this Court, by his deputy, wrote to the clerk of the Court of Appeals and requested that the original to these documents be set up, saying that they were not included within the record which had been set up by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.236" offset="15204289">And the clerk of the Court of Appeals wrote back and said, “We don't have them but we have, however, inquired from the clerk of the District Court and he has obtained photocopies of them from the Treasury agent in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.196" offset="15272208">These are forwarded here with and with the -- without objection by either parties, we assume that the photocopies may be accepted the same as the originals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.974" offset="15319228">Those were set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.421" offset="15329050">They were printed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.125" offset="15335842">I should say, they were copied in the record at page 87 and 83 of the record, and it was only quite recently that it was discovered for reasons which nobody seems to know exactly the answer that the original of these checks is and was within the files of the court and that these endorsements are in this form “Daneil H. Gilbert -- Daniel H. Bartfield on one line, Charline R.Bartfield on the second line, R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee, on the third line,” no “by” there at all in both the original brief and in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.733" offset="15554330">There's quite a bit of arguing back and forth about whether we should accept these photocopies which didn't include the word “by.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.073" offset="15591633">Now, that's not in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.906" offset="15603022">We have before us a very simple case, as we see it, whether it's nothing on the face of these endorsements which, on its face, shows that the petitioner signed for the Bartfields at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="4637.843" offset="18654751">Now originally, they complained everything hinged on this word “by.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.653" offset="18693935">Since the word “by” is out, now they're shifting around on the use of word to somewhat different contentions and it's contended for one thing that the face of the check there, when it says “Daniel H. and Charlene R. Bartfield c/o R. Milo Gilbert,” followed by endorsements on the other side shows, looking at both of them together, that Gilbert signed for all three.Not at all, not at all as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.579" offset="18837713">All that happens there is that you have checks made to the Barkfields as the principal payees in care of the petitioner who had also have to sign, but he hasn't signed “by” or he hasn't signed “care of” or anything to show agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.009" offset="18907408">He just signed “trustee” and, now, they claim that “trustee” is the key word that shows that they were signing the previous signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.550" offset="18961533">Our answer to that is not at all also, because when you add the word “trustee” to a signature, it may very well and probably have been that it was simply put there to show which account this check and these checks were to be -- to be deposited to, and that is not simply our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.788" offset="19074487">That is the position which the petitioner has taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.655" offset="19094026">In his petition herein, he said at page 10 at footnote 7 that the reason was undoubtedly so as to facilitate the bank clerks in determining into which account to deposit the check.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.664" offset="19166020">In the trial, the same theory was advocated by defense counsel where they were arguing for a motion for judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.947" offset="19203114">That's at page 63 and Mr. Dorn said there, “I think it's the general practice to put down in endorsing a check, the name of the account to which the check is to be deposited.”</text>

            <text syncTime="5276.030" offset="21207542">That would constitute merely a misrepresentation of authority by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.668" offset="21238053">Let us view, for a moment, how that crept into our law because, as we will tempt to show, it wasn't originally the common law understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.892" offset="21286954">The first case which took such a view was decided in Great Britain in 1847, Queen against White.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.323" offset="21328645">The facts in that case were simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.388" offset="21340975">White, a former employee of one Thomas Thomassen, went into the bank with a bill of exchange payable to Thomassen which he wish to present and get the money for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5322.206" offset="21392175">They thought he, of course, was still an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.433" offset="21405132">The clerk wrote on the face of the bill of exchange “per procuration, Thomas Thomassen” and then said to White, “sign.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.668" offset="21442017">He signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.092" offset="21451734">The jury, observing the legal question, the jury found that he was guilty and the legal question was resolved by 15 judges of the court -- King's Bench Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.188" offset="21528116">Actually, the court didn't say anything to justify what its finding was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.412" offset="21552985">It said this is the case of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.658" offset="21561971">As far as we're able to find, it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.544" offset="21569599">There's no previous case that we have located of which has been cited deciding that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.746" offset="21594363">But it just said, without opinion, that this is not forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.471" offset="21625292">Apparently, I would say that the reasoning perhaps was that of the petitioner's counter -- the petitioner's counsel in that case, which was that the bank clerk had relied not on the signature but he'd signed on the -- he relied upon the signer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.771" offset="21686418">Why did he sign that right in his presence there and reliance was placed on that rather than on the representation of authority?</text>
            <text syncTime="5403.247" offset="21716407">Well, that was the law established in 1847 in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.161" offset="21743992">How did it get over here?</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.961" offset="21755173">Well, in 1856 or 1857, a Massachusetts case decided this, that's the Baldwin case and in 1861, this took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.425" offset="21809089">Parliament, which apparently had seen the mischievous effects of this kind of interpretation of forgery on the business community, changed the law and, by statute, defined forgery so that it included anything which is a misrepresentation of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.998" offset="21883382">Now, that's 1861.</text>
            <text syncTime="5447.103" offset="21891741">In 1866, there's a New York case which without -- in which White was cited, but the court didn't cite anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.018" offset="21935417">It just decided it wasn't forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="5460.647" offset="21945971">But, how Regina against White really got into our law, as I see it, was through the case of Henry Tully, decided by the Southern District of New York in 1884.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.065" offset="22003649">And in that case, which was in extradition case of an Englishman who had, with authority in that case, signed certain checks on his bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="5486.086" offset="22047744">He was employee of an English Bank there and he'd signed certain checks and -- which he was authorized to do, and then he'd claim to turnover the money to other agents of the bank but instead, he had taken the money and fled to America, $200,000 worthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.956" offset="22115244">When he got over here, they attempted to extradite him under a forgery statute, under forgery treaty I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.772" offset="22146487">And, the Circuit Court of the Southern District of New York held that this wasn't forgery because, first, and this was its holding, because Tully had authority to withdraw -- to sign those checks for the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.425" offset="22225063">They said, “Even without authority, under Regina against White, he wouldn't be guilty of forgery and so, were not going to send him back.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.363" offset="22264874">Now, it got in, as you see there, as a dictum, not knowing that England itself had already disavowed Regina against White by changing in its statutory form the definition of forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.610" offset="22325791">Well, Tully and White had been the progenitors of all the American cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5562.789" offset="22354526">So far as I have been able to find, I think that's great.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.327" offset="22372707">They all trace back to an English case, the parent country of which had disavowed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.665" offset="22406040">In which, regarding to this country, largely by way of dictum, it is, as I have said, been largely adapted by the state courts and by -- and, usually, by the federal courts, although there had been dissenters on that, which we cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.935" offset="22483153">Now, should we apply that to this case or to this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.044" offset="22523591">This statute, it looks bright and spanking new in its US Code form, but it's really an 1823 statute which has come down to us without substantial change.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.006" offset="22575417">So really, if you are getting right to the beat of the thing, you want to look back at this as a statute enacted 50 years before -- or 25 years before White and 50 years before Tully.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.725" offset="22638320">And, what did Congress mean at that time?</text>
            <text syncTime="5637.169" offset="22652008">Well, in the first place, they entitled the Act, an Act to punish -- let me get it exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.439" offset="22753155">Well, I believe this is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.267" offset="22756394">I don't find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.103" offset="22759737">An Act to punish frauds committed against the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.985" offset="22775306">That is it, exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.455" offset="22785233">In other words, at least in the title of the Act, they were primarily interested in preventing fraud and that is, historically, the purpose of forgery statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5683.291" offset="22836537">And what was the meaning of forgery at that time?</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.051" offset="22855555">At that time, there were no American cases that I have found which give any very adequate definition that's clarifying on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5701.641" offset="22909889">But let's look at what some of the English authorities said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.828" offset="22926712">If I may read, Blackstone said that forgery is the fraudulent making or alteration of a writing to the prejudice of another man's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.683" offset="22970075">That's broad enough certainly to cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.572" offset="22985644">Coke said that forgery is property taken when the act is done in the name of another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="5727.133" offset="23011871">Well, this was taken in the name of another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.738" offset="23026291">In getting more directly to the question here, whether unauthorized signatures may constitute forgery, let's take a look at some other language which was initially -- initially pronounced by Sergeant Hawkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.422" offset="23097031">He said, “Also, the notion of forgery does not seem so much to consist in the counterfeiting of a man's hand and seal, which may often be done innocently.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5758.983" offset="23139349">You see, that's what we are talking -- what the petitioner is talking about now, it's counterfeiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.606" offset="23157844">He says it doesn't consist so much in that which may often be done innocently, but in endeavoring to give an appearance of truth to a mere deceit and falsity and either to impose that upon the world as a solemn act of another which he is in no way privy to, and that's what the jury found here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.480" offset="23245302">That petitioner was not privy to the Bartfields, or at least to make a man's own act hereto have been done at a time when it was not done, and by force of such falsity to give it an operation which in truth and justice, it ought not to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.098" offset="23303816">Well, now, under Hawkins' definition, this would be forgery, I say, and that language was copied by Baker, almost verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5809.114" offset="23339865">And East who wrote in 1803, and it is said to have written most extensive of any author at that time prior to 1823 on the subject of forgery, has about 200 pages on the subject in his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5825.346" offset="23404753">He says this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5826.598" offset="23409768">He quotes also the language of Hawkins and Baker, and he adds this, “It's a making (Inaudible) of any written instrument for the purpose of fraud and deceit, and wrestle on the prize which is a very old text.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.157" offset="23476015">The first edition came out four years before the statute was enacted in 1819 and the recent edition, 11th edition, came out 1958 and they mentioned -- the author there mentions the generality with which forgery was understood in the early 18th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.345" offset="23548740">So, we say that, actually, if you get right down to the legal question, which we initially thought was presented by this case in our brief, in our position, whether where on the face of the endorsement, there was a showing that the previous endorsements were by another person as agent, we say that even if that situation on the facts are presented, looking at the particular statute here, the purpose of the statute, and how this later concept crept into the law, that we shouldn't apply that rather narrow definition of forgery to this case because there is a fraud on the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.794" offset="23754585">The fraud on the Government --</text>

            <text syncTime="5936.215" offset="23848208">However, as this particular statute, it is especially clear because this statute was enacted in 1823 before Regina against White ever came up, and that theory was ever advocated.</text>

            <text syncTime="6480.284" offset="26024521">When he quotes the Supreme Court there, I think he's inaccurate because I don't find such an opinion in the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="6487.496" offset="26053360">I do think this, while he didn't consider that as critical, some of these counts containing the word “by,” these two counts not including it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6501.420" offset="26109053">I think that regardless of that, the actual facts in this case and the actual checks which were before the jury showed that there wasn't any “by” there, so there's nothing which is a matter of law which took this question away from the jury, and the jury was left with its only real factual issue to determine which was a question of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6527.304" offset="26212603">That was to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="6528.491" offset="26217305">Did they believe the Bartfields or did they believe the petitioner?</text>

            <text syncTime="6534.436" offset="26241128">And let me point this out further, that when we talk about affirming the Court of Appeals, it doesn't make any difference that the Government apparently and did, incur in this mistake before that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6550.608" offset="26305808">Because the actual facts, which revealed, show that his word “by” wasn't in there and so, this Court can and should affirm any judgment which appears upon actual facts as they are shown by the record, whether by any assumed facts would be an entirely artificial situation to determine this case on the basis of facts which were not true and which don't form the basis which the court -- which the jury determine this case on, which was the actual checks themselves.</text>
