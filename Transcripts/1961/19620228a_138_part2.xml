            <label>Mr. Charles H. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">If I may just conclude this matter with (Inaudible) sentences, I'll come directly to the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.659" offset="166013">I would ask Your Honors' attention to the reasons which they assign for these new proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.828" offset="202689">At page 38 of our brief, it's in one sentence and I'll read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.428" offset="225050">The petitioner seeking a threatened infringement of its rights under the Federal Constitutions may have a cause of action which it cannot seek in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.471" offset="285236">It should not be foreclosed for bringing such suit nor should it be subjected to irreparable harm pending the judicial determination of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.817" offset="334660">And then it proceeds to -- at page 31 to offer and what it calls an assurance that if the case in the federal court is suspended, pending to file determination in a state court action to be brought, they will agree that there will be no enforcement proceedings in the meanwhile and or any penalties for business in the meanwhile.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.315" offset="456600">Of course, it's inconceivable that even where they have assurance of that third parties like those who are the trackers and so forth are going to be very much impressed with that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.158" offset="532041">They are not parties to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.092" offset="539773">And in also, it puts our entire business onto a shadow.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.416" offset="565060">I'm stating that because they cite the Harrison case in 360 U.S. 167 where abstention was granted in an opinion which stressed the fact that as a matter of discretion, there had been assurances by the state officials that there would be no enforcement proceedings pending final determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.184" offset="676133">Well, the answer to that is, in the first place that that assurance had been given at the very outset of the federal court suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.758" offset="718451">They came by to him and said but in this case of course, we met nothing but threats and effort suit proceedings, subpoenas save, representatives consulting, going to interstate bonded trackers, going to us and telling us that there would be criminal and civil proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.403" offset="804968">And in the second place, in the Harrison case as it all the cases they say that foreign commerce isn't involved at all with all the consequences in law and to the -- make them so on nationalism which is essential here are.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.614" offset="889814">Our justice sentenced from the -- this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.225" offset="932237">I am quoting from 289 U.S. Board of Trustees, “The principle of duality in our system does not attach the authority of the Congress in the regulation of foreign commerce the right to engage in foreign commerce is not the gift to a state and the state cannot regulate or restrain.”</text>
            <text syncTime="230.353" offset="1024815">Now of that being so, I am also saying that the Harrison case has no parallel to this case or to these proposals because as I come to the Twenty-First Amendment, I will refer you to two state court decisions in New York each by our appellant division which is the intermediate appellate court holding squarely that the Twenty-First Amendment does not give any dual jurisdiction or any much less any veto power over foreign commerce in wines and liquors conducted as it's conducted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.964" offset="1247274">Now then, I come to the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.078" offset="1267649">And I'm going to call Your Honors' attention to the extraordinary statement that they make and have to make in order to give that Amendment any possibility of application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.460" offset="1325223">You will find it on page 18 of their brief, it's in a heading and in black type and I'll read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.124" offset="1375901">“Regulation of the liquor traffic in the state -- by the state is paramount,” notice this word paramount “To the Federal Governments' right to regulate” and all we are talking about is foreign commerce here, “Whether under the constitutional provisions governing commerce, exports and imports and supremacy or under statutory and regulatory provisions of a preemptive character.”</text>
            <text syncTime="353.352" offset="1516753">I regard that as the extremely revolutionary statement the like of which will be found in no decision by this or any other court.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.798" offset="1570565">“Paramount”, it's a complete denial of the national power as regards foreign commerce in wines and liquors.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.647" offset="1625945">It would make impossible the plan which is contained in 311, any state on the seaboard or on the Pacific Coast or indeed in the interior could veto that plan in cause it to fall as utterly ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.765" offset="1710477">Now, let me refer in the discussion back to the concessions made by the Attorney General in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.632" offset="1753945">We all know that the wording of the Twenty-First Amendment is this, “The transportation or importa -- importation into any state territory or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of the intoxicating liquors in violation of the laws thereof is hereby prohibited.”</text>
            <text syncTime="435.432" offset="1845060">Now I read you, but may I just repeat these three concessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.428" offset="1865122">Delivery is not made within the state because it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.730" offset="1886333">There's no delivery to anybody except to cause delivery to the place or to the plane but that plane is an interstate -- is upon plane -- upon commerce plane and there's no delivery to the passenger until he's reached abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.008" offset="1959372">The original package is not destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.879" offset="1970866">Second concession was it's not a sale or consumption in the state and of course, that means within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.863" offset="2002840">And the third one is that this is an export within the meaning of Section 311.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.024" offset="2031470">Now says my friend, that not withstanding all that, that Statute 311 does mean a thing when it comes to wines and liquors is completely at the mercy of the state either to impose a license or to impose a tax or to veto it altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.477" offset="2125302">And it's that, that is claimed in this case, complete disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.695" offset="2154141">And of course it -- that claim about the Twenty-First Amendment now brought forward completely contradicts the whole doctrine that the other side of contended before up to this moment that they shouldn't be abstention by the federal court because could there'd be anymore of a federal question, a preeminent federal question than the interpretation and application of the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.516" offset="2285484">If there was anything in the world that made this a federal case which should not have been bound out to the state courts for determination in some state action not then existing, it would be the question of the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.936" offset="2367091">So they contradict their whole line by bringing this into the picture and I'm saying that if there is any question about the Twenty-First Amendment then the relief I ask for should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.516" offset="2425396">We should be put right back in the state court as of the preeminent court by statute and the right of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.873" offset="2482866">Mr. Tuttle, I suppose the state might answer you an interpretation of the state statutes as not applicable to your business, makes it unnecessary to reach the constitutional question or the meaning of the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.563" offset="2773661">Because I think you yourself said earlier that you made reference to one or two cases at least Pullman and Sabre which is frivolous that a proper reason for abstention is that a state law might be so constitute as to avoid the necessity to determine a federal constitutional question.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_h_tuttle" startTime="687.837" stopTime="853.311">
            <label>Mr. Charles H. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="687.837" offset="2854745">Now, the Pullman case is the progenitive of a line of federal cases on which abstention has been based from time-to-time.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.248" offset="2908348">I deal with that in the brief because I show that in every case including the Pullman case which my friend cites in his brief, there were outstanding grounds for the inapplicability of the doctrine of those cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.864" offset="2986820">In the first place, there was no foreign commerce involved in anyone of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.584" offset="3013674">In the second place, there was no affirmative right in anyone of them created by the Federal Government in the exercise of its constitutional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.822" offset="3062680">Certainly, no paramount right created.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.825" offset="3082637">There were cases where the Federal Constitution was invoked solely for the protection of private right.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.004" offset="3123388">Let me give you one of the illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.677" offset="3138121">Under a state court -- under a state statute of Pennsylvania, there was a condemnation proceeding against the plaintiff's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.092" offset="3187754">The issue was whether the state statute made adequate provision for proper compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.041" offset="3219519">The owners of the property rushed in to the federal court and said the sup -- Due Process Clause gathers supremacy from this nature as one of the provisions in the Constitution and because of the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.161" offset="3283989">And this Court said that there was a question which might remove the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.269" offset="3320456">There was no action of a hostile character being taken like sending the police surrounded to, solving injunction of criminal proceedings as I gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.146" offset="3367999">The -- this Court said that -- those are questions is to whether that statute did or did not provide adequate cause and compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.752" offset="3410422">And therefore, there could be an abstention to find out what they are -- there was plainly a duality of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.383" offset="3452949">Plainly and above all exclusive jurisdiction was not involved in any sense of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.238" offset="3480325">Now, all these cases and all those cited by Judge Beeks including the Pullman case fall within that area.</text>

            <text syncTime="3851.674" offset="15510026">In California against Washington, which Your Honors may recall, only in 1958, that was an action which arose under the original jurisdiction of this Court where the State of California sought to file a bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.127" offset="15559868">And my office filed a brief in support of California's position as amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.231" offset="15588289">Now, we contended in that case that the Twenty-First Amendment did not subordinate federal rights arising under the Commerce Clause to state regulation, and we specifically requested this Court to overrule its decision in State Board of Equalization against Young's Market Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.276" offset="15656521">This Court rejected our argument and denied leave to file the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.900" offset="15670941">So now were on the other side and we kind of take advantage or something we learned in the California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.068" offset="15707617">Now, I should like to continue under this Twenty-First Amendment situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.104" offset="15731754">Counsel for the petitioner says that this is a state question and he says in Rosenbloom against Franklin appellate division case in New York State, the -- the views which he expressed as to relative superiority of supremacy were decided in favor of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.636" offset="15813883">Now assuming that is so, I still say that this Court is not bound by a state court determination on a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.315" offset="15848678">Now, the other cases which they cite may be distinguished on various grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.390" offset="15864978">For example, manner of Gulf Oil Co. against McGoldrick which was in an appellate division decision affirmed by the New York Court of Appeals and later affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.552" offset="15901550">The Court disallowed a city sales tax on oil which was held in bonded warehouses Class 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.654" offset="15929971">And might I parenthetically amplify on the definition of a Class 6 warehouse about which Mr. Justice Stewart inquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.684" offset="15966124">Class 6 bonded warehouses don't deal only with wines and liquors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3972.994" offset="15995382">And so here, you had oil which was in a bonded warehouse Class 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.033" offset="16015548">And the tax was stricken down on the ground that this was an unconstitutional interference for foreign commerce, but this case dealt with oil, not liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.197" offset="16060165">The impact of the Twenty-First Amendment wasn't present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.539" offset="16073540">In addition to that, it may be distinguished on the ground that it dealt with the tax and not with that part of the police power of the state which is reserved to the state under Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.640" offset="16121919">In Drory against Valenti, another case relied upon by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.427" offset="16145115">There was a question with respect to liquor stored for export purposes in the foreign trade zone in the Port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.574" offset="16173641">Now, that is an enclosed police area which was created under federal law pursuant to state statutory authorization.</text>

            <text syncTime="4058.871" offset="16338840">So that to this extent, the state statute may be construed as a legislative surrender by the state with respect to the foreign trade zone area --</text>

            <text syncTime="4645.424" offset="18685053">His claim for inadequacy of relief falling, he then claims that there's no state action now pending and therefore they can't be abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.660" offset="18722043">And of course, this Court has many times ordered abstention where no state action was presently pending.</text>

            <text syncTime="4758.928" offset="19139062">Therefore, we don't have jurisdiction because if we were to take jurisdiction, we would be supplanting the statutory scheme for direct appeal from the single judge court -- from the three-judge court to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.426" offset="19185037">And therefore, they should dismiss the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.262" offset="19200397">That was what said in Stratton.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.044" offset="19207502">That's exactly what the Court of Appeals did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.688" offset="19222131">If this Court was to follow Stratton, it would have to tell the court to do exactly what has already done.</text>

            <text syncTime="4791.040" offset="19267584">In Stratton -- in Stratton that sudden determination was on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4797.549" offset="19293602">It said you -- you have the --- instead there was a determination on the merits, Court of Appeals on the merits that the tax was valid or invalid, I forgot which.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.871" offset="19330905">And they had no power to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.616" offset="19341876">But it's a very different thing to decide just as this Court when it holds it had no jurisdiction as we did in Bailey.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.536" offset="19373537">We can make a proper disposition for the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.415" offset="19389001">It was too modest with his power in saying it couldn't do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.489" offset="19405302">It could pass on -- it had jurisdiction to decide what the District Court Judge did, and then it could have jurisdiction to seek the District Court did and in fact that the District Judge did the right thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="4836.713" offset="19450232">May I just take a moment, I see the -- my time is almost up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.055" offset="19467577">Just to make some comments about my practical solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.189" offset="19480116">I'll admit that it was born on the spirit of impatience with the fact that the rules should have become such that six judges seating, three in the district level and three in the -- in the Court of Appeals plus attorneys and the Attorney General's Office plus eminent counsel Mr. Tuttle could have become embroiled in such awfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.887" offset="19562872">And so purely for the sake of cutting the Gordian Knot, without minimizing the force of any of the objection for that made or any of the arguments that I've made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.506" offset="19609370">I have suggested this alternative suggestion -- alternative method of remanding it to the single judge granting the petition for mandamus, directing him to request the convening of a three-judge court but directing the three-judge court to abstain pending determination of the state question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.811" offset="19678647">Now, there are a several things I think Your Honors ought to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.085" offset="19691708">First place, the question of whether abstention should have in the first instance be considered by the three-judge court of the first or the single judge court would be out, we wouldn't have to worry about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.395" offset="19736952">The question of the restraints whether we give them voluntary assurances or whether they have it under the state statute would be out because of three-judge court unquestionably could restrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.221" offset="19776240">But lastly and most importantly, I think, is the fact that actually doesn't make any difference whether it's a single judge court or a three-judge court which abstains.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.273" offset="19816469">Because if the cases preempted to the state courts in the manner of which this Court in the Windsor case, on the second remain, said it should be remanded where it said that it should -- the state question should be decided by the state court in the light of the constitutional objections which were presented to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.122" offset="19907897">The entire case would be before the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.753" offset="19918346">In other words, not merely was this is a sale, but assuming it was a sale, does it violate the Federal Constitution in the respects alleged by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.305" offset="19960560">That being so, when it goes through the three tiers of the state court, it will be reviewable by this Court directly on certiorari, thereby effectively bypassing the -- the District Court whether it'd be single judge or three -judge court.</text>
