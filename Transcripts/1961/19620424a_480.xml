            <text syncTime="50.289" offset="304567">There is a subsidiary allegation that the City had failed to inspect or test the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.538" offset="337481">The case against the City of Galveston was strictly consoled on the allegations of negligence, nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.669" offset="374053">As against the respondent, Cardigan Shipping Company, the case was presented there against that company for negligence in hand to inspect the test and on an allegation of unseaworthiness by way of a brief description of the operation to the elevator, this primary at an export house to Water Sack.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.846" offset="478751">The grain, when it comes in mostly by railcars, is tested and sampled for the Galveston Exchange Board of Trade Inspectors and Supervisor of the Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.396" offset="528906">That inspection was made while the car is still in the yard, five samples were taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.862" offset="566836">Then the car is taken to the elevator; unload it, again by opening the doors and by a person near the elevator.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.272" offset="604453">It then goes in by gravity down into a container, has taken by elevating legs about 1000 buckets running this way sir, up to the escape holes, where it's weighed then it goes by shoot, down to its conveyor belts and goes by conveyor belts to the various -- one of the 400 semi bins in the elevator.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.616" offset="697866">While in the elevator, stays generally speaking in the same vent.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.769" offset="714480">After that, and when it's desired to export, the owner will order so many bushels over a certain grade of grain.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.393" offset="780936">After the order is placed, a lineup was made out of which the grain will be taken, that is to particular bins and then there's not just at the bottom of each bin, you take the conveyor belt that open up it so many notches, having to use the various grades to get the desired grade to go into the ship and then runs on this conveyor belt to an elevating leg again and goes back up to the scales, again on the -- and then again on the conveyer belt and to a shipping bin roughly housed to the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.887" offset="922937">Stevedore or the chief stevedore, well then order the grain to be released by telephone and the City employees do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="864.469" offset="3561200">Actually, this was one of these extremely coincidental matters that the fumigant ever got to this particular balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.252" offset="3592338">Chloropicrin is applied as a watery liquid.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.017" offset="3607489">I mean it's supposed to be sprinkled over the grain in the inland granary or in the railroad cars or cars being loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.320" offset="3636642">An expert testified at the trial that the only possible way that this chloropicrin got through to this bin on the Grelmarion was that somebody carelessly dumped a lot of this watery liquid on to a particular portion of the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.644" offset="3705919">There was really a sudden mass of grain at being a watery type of liquid unlike the more gaseous types.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.580" offset="3737684">This wet grain was able to survive the journey in the railcars, the elevation and through the Galveston Wharves elevator, the weighing, the shifting into bins, the measuring out, the mixing, the putting in the loading bin and the travel down to shoot from the elevator into the vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="946.106" offset="3887835">The medical testimony and also some late testimony as well as the expert's, indicating that the characteristics of the fumigant experienced by the libelants was such -- it was a pretty sure thing, it was chloropicrin.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.695" offset="3938200">It affects the eyes, I mean there was one bit of evidence that to me was very conclusive and that these men were taken for first aid to a doctor's office and the nurse in that office, the day following, noticed that there was some kind of a watery substance that gotten on her clothing that made here eyes smart.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.102" offset="4019806">It might also be said and because this is somewhat relevant to the issue of damages which is raised by the petitioner here, the chlo -- the another characteristic of chloropicrin unlike some of the other fumigants used which are chlorinated hydrocarbons, the chloropicrin can be highly annoying but if it's sufficiently concentrated, it kills you.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.901" offset="4099009">If it's not that well concentrated, you get over it rather quickly, it has immediate effects but they're passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.878" offset="4118862">There's no permanent damage to deliver such as with result from Weevil-Cide which is a chlorinated hydrocarbon or the High Life which is never used on ships, incidentally because it's too volatile and too explosive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.210" offset="4180198">It all -- might also be said while we are talking about what was the chemical involved here that the libelants made in the trial court and have since raised in their petition for certiorari and in their brief the question of an absence of -- of test as called for by government literature?</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.633" offset="4277896">Actually, the court disregarded all of that evidence and I think it should be disregarded here because the literature referred to test of grain for the purpose of human consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.363" offset="4328782">And actually, there was an exception in this -- in these manuals and said it did not apply to the application of these kind of fumigants that we were discussing here to grains, but they were talking about some other grains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.026" offset="4383431">This is at page 714 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.572" offset="4413628">That the ethylene dibromide and methobromide or the kind of things that could penetrate a grain and make it unfit for human consumption and these were the things that Miller, under the Food and Drug actually test for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.104" offset="4463783">But these were not the kind of chemicals that were ever used in fumigating grains in elevators or in railcars or on ships to get rid of weevils.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.028" offset="4511535">But I -- I would call the Court's attention to this matter of the chloropicrin because I wanted to illustrate the extreme coincidence that ever brought it in to this area where it caused the affliction to these libelants, I mean it took an extreme chain of circumstances, just-right atmospheric conditions to keep it from dissipating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.662" offset="4598053">And apparently, the heat generated by the last trip down the spout, from the elevator into the bin of the ship was just right with other conditions to make this watery substance turn into gassy substance and as it came out of the spout and into the bin on the ship, the men there immediately felt the effects coming off the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.806" offset="4678614">Now, this is, to me, the second factual point that is of high importance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.310" offset="4712573">The evidence -- all of the longshoreman, I believe, testified and their evidence as well as the evidence of other men who were in the bin but are not parties to this case, was all to the effect that they immediately felt something smarting their eyes and making them tear as the grain was still coming out of the spout and before them into this closed-in bin where they will work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.088" offset="4803688">In other words, they received whatever toxic effects they received directly off the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.632" offset="4833886">There's a mark difference in that connection between -- and I think the Circuit Court so noticed as Mr. Mandell referred to it yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.346" offset="4868786">Between that case and the case where maybe the grain had been piled up so high that the men exhausted the oxygen in the air that they were working, and for lack of a fresh supply of oxygen, they were asphyxiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.255" offset="4924374">The medical testimony in this case was not of asphyxiation or a lack of oxygen at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.829" offset="4946735">The medical testimony in this case was of an acute intoxication which meant that a gas of toxic effect was inhaled directly and suddenly, I mean it wasn't chronic or accumulated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.982" offset="5355290">I don't know -- incidentally, it might also be said that the hysteria that developed was due to an initial suspicion that this may have been a fumigant such as involved in those three prior incidents that happened more than four years -- the last, more than the four years previously where the fumigant used was a chlorinated hydrocarbon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.489" offset="5441285">And I'm sure all of us that had the careless experience of one time or another whiffing an open bottle of carbon tetrachloride which is chlorinated hydrocarbon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.002" offset="5487365">And even though we are in this room with all the oxygen and everything that's around us, that -- that gas as we whiff it is very penetrating.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.694" offset="5546193">Incidentally, it's also a very bad gas too within that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.870" offset="6166862">There was no inspection being conducted to determine direct, the presence of fumigant residuals in this grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.511" offset="6221406">Frankly, I think the trial court found it would have been impossible to examine the grain that closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.850" offset="6250768">This particular chloropicrin may have come off of 40 or 50 bushels of grain at the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.239" offset="6272293">The ship was loading 300 or 400,000 bushels of grain at a very fast rate from the elevators' grain spouts leading in to about four holes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.918" offset="6323075">The -- the stevedore in charge of the loading had the opportunity, as the record shows, of cutting off this flow of grain if at anytime the government inspectors stationed at the end of either any spout, notice the grain was off-grade in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.432" offset="6393083">Now, one of the things that would put a grain off-grade would not only be the mixture but if it comes out with an objectionable odor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.892" offset="6422967">In other words, if the men themselves had noticed this chloropicrin, they would have the stopped the run of grain at the deck before allowing the ship to complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.110" offset="6467793">Actually, the -- the manner in which this grain is handled though would mean that even if he called up to the elevator and said, "Stop spout number 3," it takes probably 30 minutes -- 30 seconds to a minute before they can cut the flow of grain off at the elevator house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.467" offset="6529233">And meanwhile, whatever effect was going to happen to the men on this bin would have already happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.659" offset="6553997">So you have a situation of something happening -- happening very suddenly and even frankly, if they had known it was going to happen, they couldn't have stopped it in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.682" offset="6586075">But the -- going back to what Mr. Mandell calls the "crux of the question here" and I believe it is just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.277" offset="6628498">It is the question whether the shipowners warranty extends to the condition of the cargo because from the view point of approximate cause, it was a condition of the cargo which caused the injury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.532" offset="6685550">And I think counsel really conceives that in his opening argument to the Court yesterday though other elements of the case are injected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.944" offset="6731107">We always come back to this single question, does the ship besides warranting that the ship itself is seaworthy -- besides warranting that its appurtenances are seaworthy, besides warranting that its personnel are fit for their calling?</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.719" offset="6802265">Does the ship also warrant that the cargo which is being taken aboard is free from the conditions which might cause harm?</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.115" offset="6835806">And as stated in our brief, we find no case which says so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.514" offset="6861406">And if it is so held in this case, I believe it would be an extension of the doctrine of unseaworthiness as stated up to now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.646" offset="6897977">There are some cases involving cashew oil liquids.</text>

            <text syncTime="2887.566" offset="11653622">The -- a Mr. Carroll who was the Superintendent of the Galveston Wharves was called as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.515" offset="11697403">And on page 26 of my brief, this witness testified in rather detail how the -- the grain comes into various bins and that certain bins are fumigated and others are not, that they keep a record of the bins that are fumigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.199" offset="11804191">But it further testified that from time-to-time, the grain is shifted from one bin to another and there is no record of the -- of the grain that has been shifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.805" offset="11870542">There only is a record of a bin and the Court -- when the Court realized that, it's stopped them and the Court asked him this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.829" offset="11906696">The point I'm making is, if you don't know a body's possible transfers from bin one to bin two, how can you tell me conclusively that a grain from bin two that went in to the vessel had not been switched around and hence perhaps hadn't been fumigated, do you follow me?</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.238" offset="12004289">In other words based -- the evidence was that they loaded that bin from so many number bins, but also -- the evidence was also undisputed that there was no record kept if grain in bin five that was fumigated, was transferred to bin two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.465" offset="12097181">In other words, they kept the record of the bins that were fumigated but not of the grain and the grain was constantly shifted from one bin to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.290" offset="12132498">And the court says -- the court asked him, "Do you follow me?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.938" offset="12147127">The witness says, "I follow you."</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.365" offset="12152874">“There is a slight possibility that a small amount of that could have happened?”</text>

            <text syncTime="3025.948" offset="12207208">Actually, there was n record that the bins of -- of the grain that was actually fumigated but only on the bins and there record is undisputed that a grain would be shifted from one bin to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.309" offset="12264573">There is more than that Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.359" offset="12280769">The record is undisputed that a tests that were made as Mr. Watson stated, was for the quality of the grain and not for the purpose of determining whether it has been fumigated or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.372" offset="12352867">And how did they go about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.413" offset="12361017">They go to a car -- the railroad car that comes alongside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.399" offset="12380975">If it comes in by 12, there is no -- apparently, no method of inspecting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.491" offset="12401351">But go to a car and they pick up a sample of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.474" offset="12417233">They take that bin away, some distance away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.872" offset="12434892">And sometime later in some laboratory, somebody makes a test to their grain for the quality or whether that has weevils in it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.522" offset="12485465">Now, they say incidentally, if there is some unusual odor we noted, but there is no evidence at all in this record that any inspection was ever made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.868" offset="12538859">Now, this is fortified by further testimony and the court was interested in it and a witness by the name of Goss, he was the sampler who stayed on the ship and as the grain came out from the spot, took some samples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.644" offset="12613987">And he -- this man was present when these men were buried in their bin and when they were pulled out, he asked them, "Did you yourself see the mill?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.451" offset="12649200">"Yes sir, I saw the mill."</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.547" offset="12657560">"Well, did it seem to you that our air from fumigant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.295" offset="12668531">“It seemed to me that way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.356" offset="12676786">"Did you then take your sample to test, to see what was the matter with that grain?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.319" offset="12708655">He said, "No, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.117" offset="12715865">"Well didn't it seem to you that that was the time to do it?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.660" offset="12729971">He said, "No, sir because I do not test it for that purpose."</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.201" offset="12748152">But the evidence goes further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.674" offset="12758079">Immediately above the vessel or before the last bin -- the grain in the last bin has poured into the spout, no tests were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.939" offset="12811160">At the crucial point, now this was a shot of 500 bushels of grain that obviously was contaminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.489" offset="12853373">Now, what did the ship do about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.269" offset="12860479">With the knowledge that they had of the previous condition, nothing but absolutely nothing, they just assumed that everything would be alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.726" offset="12926307">Now then, an answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's question yesterday, "What could they have done?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.215" offset="12952221">This is one of the things that they could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.047" offset="12963610">But frankly under the doctrine established by this Court and what I thought firmly established by this Court, knowledge is not prerequisite and it has been found in this -- in this cashew oil grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.402" offset="13048978">Some seamen while loading some cashew nut -- cashew nut oil, drums of cashew nut oil and some of them got into their hands because it was a leaky drum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.924" offset="13111045">It was just gotten in onboard ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.967" offset="13127241">The vessel had no knowledge of the situation, couldn't have had a knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.614" offset="13145840">There was no question in the District Judge's mind that that was an unseaworthy condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.676" offset="13170082">There're many other cases, in the Boudoin case decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.078" offset="13195682">(Inaudible) know of the vicious disposition in propensities of the seaman until the assault, he was a calm gentleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.110" offset="13243852">Until under certain conditions, he became vicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.618" offset="13257853">This Court held that seaman to render the vessel unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.741" offset="13278333">In the Johnson Line versus Maloney, there was presence of wheat dust and wheat kernels on the deck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.344" offset="13316786">A situation that to me it would seem comparable to the -- to the sample that Mr. Watson gave and so the rest of the trade because you cannot load grain, I don't think, without getting some kernels on the deck or some wheat dust, but the Court held that to be an unseaworthy condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.663" offset="13414066">This is not a case where you -- when you're a fisherman and when you're a fishermen, has certain no risks, that I take coming here to speak before this Court, this is a great Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3415.145" offset="13764002">I draw the line in the situations for instance, I've gone aboard the vessel, I'm a longshoreman and I carry my -- my hook and I swing my hook because I feel good this morning, and I swing it right into my hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.017" offset="13831398">Certainly, that didn't render anything unseaworthy or another longshoreman trips me, not meaning to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.236" offset="13864312">That didn't render the vessel unseaworthy or I trip over my own feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.819" offset="13882598">That didn't render unseaworthy, numerous cases where I can illustrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.585" offset="13909661">But here, there was an absolute failure to supply a safe place to which that there's then no question about that, that a vessel was rendered unsafe for the purpose for which these men went down there to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.331" offset="13980714">The Court so finds and relies only on the transitory doctrine because it happened just like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.096" offset="14019793">This argument that a ship couldn't have done anything about it, it has been made many times before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.327" offset="14044662">And as I stated yesterday, the finest example is the -- the Petterson versus Alaska Steamship Company when they had a -- hook that look just tripping and it had a latent defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.568" offset="14101608">This Court had no hesitation to affirm the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.661" offset="14118013">And now, the Crumady case decided by this Court, you remember in that case, there was a good (Inaudible) but it was improperly used, made defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.097" offset="14155734">It was not inherently defective but made defective by the longshoreman working with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.411" offset="14177050">This Court had no hesitation to impose liability in this (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.209" offset="14204217">I submit that this case is a classic example of a place where the longshoremen were working in an area that was not reasonably safe to do their work, expected and intended of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.286" offset="14288541">The shipowner should've known about it, had knowledge of similar instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.792" offset="14318529">There is both negligence and unseaworthiness of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.938" offset="14347160">I say just -- this is not an inherent dangerous thing to do, longshoremen do it with safety all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.253" offset="14412361">It is only under the circumstances in which the commodity is -- becomes dangerous by reason of somebody's act, renders the area not reasonably safe to do the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.470" offset="14469204">I believe that the Mesle, a 260 F.2nd 747, sets out that -- that the standard, I think, correctly what constitutes and what does not constitute to unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.924" offset="14527091">In this instance, the shipowner had actual or constructive notice that grain is being fumigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.746" offset="14574320">It has happened in that port before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.023" offset="14591457">The shipowner didn't lift a finger that discharge his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.495" offset="14613400">Under such circumstances, we submit the liability is imposed under the law as we know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.803" offset="14646627">Thank you very much.</text>
