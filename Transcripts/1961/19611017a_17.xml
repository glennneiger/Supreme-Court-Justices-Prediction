S. A. C. Transport Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.143" offset="411982">This case is a direct appeal from a final judgment of a three-judge court, setting aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.758" offset="446360">The Commission's order denied an application by J-T Transport Company for contract carrier, extension of service permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.628" offset="485857">This case together with the Reddish case to be argued following the argument of this case, presents important questions respecting the interpretation of the 1957 Amendments, Sections 203 (a) (15) and 209 (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.567" offset="565687">Section 203 (a) (15) defines the term “contract carrier by motor vehicles”.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.505" offset="593377">Section 209 (b) prescribes the standard to be applied by the Commission in passing upon applications for contract carrier permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.827" offset="630680">It sets forth five criteria which the Commission shall consider in applying the governing standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.621" offset="661817">These statutory provisions are reproduced in the appendix to the Commission's brief at pages 65 and 66.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.292" offset="696508">They provide, in important part, as follows: Section 203 (a) (15) as amended, defines a contract carrier by motor vehicle as any person which engages in transportation by motor vehicle of passengers or property in Interstate or Foreign Commerce for compensation other than transportation as a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.396" offset="800998">Such transportation to be under continuing contracts with one person or a limited number of persons either (a), for the furnishing of transportation services to the assignment of motor vehicles for a continuing period of time, the exclusive use of each person served or (b), for the furnishing of transportation services designed to meet the distinct need of each individual customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.173" offset="908100">Section 209 (b) as amended provides that a permit shall be issued to any qualified applicant who is fit, willing, and able properly to perform the service of a contract carrier and to conform to requirements of the act and Commission regulations, where the proposed operation will be consistent with the public interest in the national transportation policy declared in the Act, otherwise, such application shall be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.735" offset="1038294">Section 209 (b) goes on to state that in determining whether issuance of a permit will be consistent with the public interest in the national transportation policy, the Commission shall consider: (1) The number of shippers to be served by the applicant, (2) The nature of the service proposed, (3) The effect which granting the permit would have upon the services of the protesting carriers, and (4) The effect which denying the permit would have upon the applicant and/or its shipper and (5) The changing character of that shipper's requirements. In this case, the Commission found that the applicant, J-T Transport's proposed operations met the definition of contract carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.198" offset="1248214">It found J-T qualified in terms of the number of shippers to be served and the nature of the service proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.182" offset="1284054">It also found that the character of the shipper's transportation requirements is not such as to preclude their performance by a common carrier.</text>

          <turn speaker="b_franklin_taylor_jr" startTime="422.472" stopTime="698.408">
            <label>Mr. B. Franklin Taylor, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="422.472" offset="1793233">So having found that J-T qualified and that the transportation could also based -- performed by a common carrier, the Commission found that the principal common carrier protestant is fully able to meet the transportation requirements of the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.278" offset="1876511">Consequently, denial of the permit would have no material adverse effect on that shipper, then concluding that the preservation of sound economic conditions and transportation required that existing carriers should be afforded the opportunity to transport available traffic which they can handle adequately before a new competitive service is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.227" offset="1988315">The Commission found that granting the permit would adversely affect the protesting carrier in this instance and that the potential loss of traffic to that carrier outweighs any detriment to the applicant flowing from a denial of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.297" offset="2060518">As a consequence of these findings, the Commission made the ultimate finding that to authorize the proposed operations will not be consistent with the public interest and the National Transpiration Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.006" offset="2119346">On the basis of its analysis of the legislative history of the 1957 Amendments and the language of the five criteria in Section 209 (b), the District Court held that in considering the ability and willingness of existing common carriers to provide service which would meet the shipper's transportation requirements, the Commission had erred by injecting a sixth test specifically rejected by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.420" offset="2257063">The Court also held that the Commission's findings respecting the effect of a denial upon the supporting shipper were in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.622" offset="2301889">It held that this Commission had improperly imposed upon the applicant and its shipper, the burden of showing the inadequacy of the existing common carrier service.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.286" offset="2356537">That the Commission had ignored evidence of specific needs which the Court found could not in fact be met by the protesting common carrier, and that the Commission had failed to make adequate findings in terms of the shipper's distinct needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.310" offset="2432606">Finally, the Court held that the Commission's finding of an adverse effect on the protesting carrier was based on an improper presumption and is without record support since the protestant is not presently handling the traffic, and consequently the grant of an application to the contract carrier would not divert present traffic away from the protesting common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.463" offset="2557262">In our view, this case then presents three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.661" offset="2582026">First, whether the Commission may consider an affirmative showing by a protesting common carrier that it is able and willing to provide a transportation service adequate to meet the transportation requirements of the shipper supporting the application for a contract carrier permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.060" offset="2679620">Second, whether in finding that denying the application will not adversely affect the supporting shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.883" offset="2718908">The Commission erred by, (1) Placing upon the applicant and its shipper, the burden of showing the inadequacy of existing service, (2) By ignoring evidence of specific needs which could not be met by the protesting carrier and (3) By failing to make findings as to those specific needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.622" offset="2817860">The third question is whether the Commission was entitled to conclude that where existing common carrier service is adequate to meet the shipper's needs, granting the permit would be inimical to the preservation of sound economic conditions in transportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="702.263" offset="2912423">Third, is whether the Commission was entitled to conclude as a matter of judgment and discretion on the record before it that where the existing common carrier service is adequate to meet the shipper's needs, granting the permits would be inconsistent with the preservation of sound economic conditions in transportation and would adversely affect the services of the protesting common carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.225" offset="3120253">The quarrel that we have with the United States is almost entirely on this third question and the United States feeling that the Commission reached its conclusion here on the basis of a presumption which did not reflect particular facts in this particular case and we are of course disagreeing and I would develop that point fully when I reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.636" offset="3245955">The facts in this case are essentially undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.357" offset="3264763">The appellee, J-T Transport Company has operated for a number of years as a regular route carrier by motor vehicle, carrying uncrated aircraft parts between various points in Midwestern and Western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.398" offset="3328920">It has been issued some 16 permits between July 1953 and January 1957 for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.795" offset="3362565">By an application filed in March of 1957, J-T sought a permit to operate as a contract carrier of aircraft landing gear bulkheads, uncrated, requiring special handling and equipment over irregular routes from Indianapolis, Indiana to Wichita, Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.590" offset="3449710">At the hearing on the application, the Wichita Division, a Boeing Airplane Company which is the consignee of the bulkheads supported the grant of the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.245" offset="3492342">Several motor common carriers appeared as protestants.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.250" offset="3512404">Now, a landing gear bulkhead weighs about 1380 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.759" offset="3530376">It's worth about $24,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.557" offset="3545631">Four bulkheads constitute a load on a trailer hauled by a truck tractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.613" offset="3573844">They are manufactured for Boeing at Indianapolis by a subcontractor and delivered to Boeing at Wichita for installation in B-52 airplanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.025" offset="3615431">At the time of the hearing which took place in May 1957, J-T had been transporting the bulkheads for about four months under temporary authority issued by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.680" offset="3662137">It was averaging slightly less than four loads per month and that is that it carried 14 loads in the slightly less than four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.441" offset="3701112">The transportation has been accomplished under the temporary authority and has proposed to be accomplished under the permit sought in this case by the use of specially designed closed top trailers, equipped with shipping fixtures, designed by J-T, the applicant, with the aid of Boeing.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.617" offset="3781883">The equipment is assigned to the exclusive use of the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.400" offset="3796929">J-T has a terminal at Wichita, but none at Indianapolis, the origin point of the shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.999" offset="3823365">Thus, J-T must deadhead its equipment 700 miles to Indianapolis in order to pick up each shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.171" offset="3860041">However, the record showed that Boeing knows sufficiently far in advance of a particular movement to give J-T ample notice in order that it may move its equipment to 700 miles to Indianapolis, transport the bulkheads back to Wichita, and still meet Boeing's production schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.722" offset="3954291">Prior to the inauguration of J-T's service under its temporary authority, railroads were used, but the record reflects dissatisfaction on the part of Boeing with the rail service principally because there was a necessity of constructing special containers in which to put the bulkheads when they were transported and that that was a costly operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.609" offset="4057840">The principal protesting carrier in this case, U. S. A. C. Transport Company is a motor common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.030" offset="4091486">Since January 1950, it has held a certificate of public convenience and necessity to transport over irregular routes, aircraft parts crated or uncrated, restricted to parts requiring special equipment or handling by reason of size, weight or fragile nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.844" offset="4170794">The geographical scope of U. S. A. C.'s certificate embraces the instant transportation between Indianapolis and Wichita.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.970" offset="4215202">The record shows and the Commission's findings in accordance with this following statement of facts with respect U. S. A. C.'s capabilities and past performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.935" offset="4267133">U. S. A. C. specialized in serving the aircraft industry for several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.719" offset="4286255">It is accustomed to modifying its equipment to meet specific transportation requirements of particular aircraft manufacturers and it has done so many times in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.634" offset="4329932">It operates more than 170 tractors and over 225 trailers including trailers which would be readily adaptable for the transportation of the traffic involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.243" offset="4384371">If tended the traffic, it would modify and make available whatever equipment is necessary to meet the shipper's transportation requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.310" offset="4420629">It has numerous terminals throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.705" offset="4434213">While it has no terminal at Wichita, it does have a terminal at Indianapolis where the shipments originate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.153" offset="4463992">Consequently, it would not have to deadhead its equipments 700 miles to pickup the shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.415" offset="4489070">It is willing to station at Indianapolis, a suitable closed type van modified and with fixtures installed to move the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.101" offset="4527731">It has idle equipment in Indianapolis and must deadhead other movements, considerable equipment out of there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.371" offset="4552808">Its drivers are required to have security clearance and that's true of J-T's drivers and apparently, it's a requirement in order to handle this type of traffic and enter the Boeing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.308" offset="4616652">Although Boeing knew of the services of U. S. A. C., it didn't try them for the Indianapolis to Wichita movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.039" offset="4655522">Generally, it gave three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.804" offset="4670568">There was a testimony about an allegedly unsatisfactory experience in using U. S. A. C. at another place in connection with other traffic in 1953, four years before the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.086" offset="4727724">The witness was unable to say whether the damage incurred at that time was a fault of the carrier or the shipper, what recovery was made or any of the details, really and the examiner shut off a cross-examination on the grounds that this was too remote in time to have any bearing on the present application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.574" offset="4809644">The second reason given was that U. S. A. C.'s tariff contains a provision which says that it may exercise control over the type of equipment to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.195" offset="4860113">Now, U. S. A. C. witness explained the purpose of that provision as being merely to ensure that its equipment would not be overloaded such that there might be damage to traffic or unsatisfactory safety conditions to give it a minimal control over its equipment since it is doing the hauling and the Commission specifically found that this sort of tariff provision was no impediment in view of U. S. A. C.'s express willingness to specifically modify and make available the necessary special equipment to handle movements in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.943" offset="5039104">The third objection offered by the shipper for not having tried the services of U. S. A. C. was that U. S. A. C. had no terminal in Wichita where Boeing is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.614" offset="5089782">But as I have pointed out, it did have a terminal in Indianapolis where the shipments originate and it has a terminal in Topeka Kansas which is about a 170 miles in Wichita, and of course, telephonic communication is always available to talk with the U. S. A. C. people so that the --</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.563" offset="6649605">I've read the report of the District Court many, many times and I'm still not clear in my own mind whether the District Court is saying flatly that the Commission may not give any consideration, or whether it is saying that the manner in which it gave consideration here was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.278" offset="6728495">It is certainly saying the latter, but some of the language in the report that for example considering the ability and willingness of existing carriers to provide the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.714" offset="6770186">The court below says, “Involves the application of a sixth test specifically rejected by Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.129" offset="6799862">So the best I can say is that may have held that the Commission may not give any consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.744" offset="6822327">I think that's the position of the United States too, as I read their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.548" offset="6837582">They feel the Court may have held that, but in any event, the other appellees, J-T Transport and the contract carrier conference pretty flatly contend that the Commission may not consider the ability and willingness of existing common carriers to provide the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.451" offset="6909158">They flatly say in their brief in more than one place that such a factor is irrelevant to the five criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.721" offset="6950222">So that -- in fact, one or the other, I think it's the J-T brief says that, “We don't think the Court went so far to say it may not give any consideration, but we go that far.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.248" offset="7000377">So that is issue is here one way or another.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.425" offset="7037053">Largely because of legislative history, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.142" offset="7047920">Now, the United States agrees with the Commission that the Commission may consider such a showing, indeed that it must.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.983" offset="7083342">We think that that's patent from a reading of the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.249" offset="7124407">I think it's clear that a showing by the existing carriers of their ability and willingness to provide a service which would meet the needs of the supporting shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.623" offset="7177906">It's necessary to be considered if the Commission is going to imply -- to apply the third and fourth criteria at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.645" offset="7213955">If the Commission is going to consider the effect which granting the permit will have upon the protesting carrier, it seems to me, it's got to consider whether the protesting carrier is in a position and is willing to provide the service to meet the shipper's requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.605" offset="7289814">And it's even more clear I believe when you consider the fourth criteria as the Commission said itself in its report, “Whether the shippers would be adversely affected by a denial must depend upon a determination of whether existing service is adequate to meet their transportation requirements.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.176" offset="7380093">And we submit the question of whether there is a need on the part of the supporting shipper for the proposed service, inherently embraces the complementary question of whether the existing available service in the field is adequate to meet the shippers' needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.569" offset="7457625">They are but opposite sides of the same coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.984" offset="7467342">So it seems to me that right from the language of the statute, you've got to consider such a showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.844" offset="7502764">Moreover, the 1957 amendments retain the same governing standard of consistency with the public interest and the National Transportation Policy that had applied since the National Transportation Policy was enacted in 1940 and had indeed applied since the motor carrier regulation was passed in 1935 because in -- until 1940, between 1935 and 1940, the standard was consistency with the public interest and Section 202 (a) of the Motor Carrier Act as it was then read and as this Court knows 202 (a) was the predecessor of the National Transportation Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.740" offset="7674337">It was that statement of policy which later as expanded became a National Transportation Policy so that this governing standard has always existed and it was not changed by the 1957 Amendments and the ability of carriers in the field has always been considered as a factor of considerable importance in determining whether a new permit or certificate should be issued and we think that the retention of the standard indicate that it should still be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.976" offset="7795231">And we don't think that it's -- of any importance that the factor of the adequacy of existing service is not specifically mentioned in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.669" offset="7842043">Appellees apparently would feel that that was significant, but as we point out in our brief, the Commission has considered many things which are not specifically written in the statute and the good example is this auxiliary and supplemental restriction in connection with common carrier certificates and contract carrier permits issued to motor carrier subsidiaries of railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.318" offset="7944652">And the Commission imports this standard -- these restrictions which originate in the Section 5 (2) (b) of the Act into Sections 207 and 209 dealing with motor carrier certificate and permits and that practice has been approved and indeed required by the Court in the number of cases, most recently in the American Trucking Associations case, 364 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.786" offset="8094490">In fact, in that American Trucking Associations' case at pages 13 and 14, and we have sent them out -- set out the quote in our brief in speaking of the amended Section 209 (b), this Court clearly recognized that the ability and willingness of the existing carriers to render the service was of a significant factor the Commission must consider and point it out, but saying at one point, there is for example no finding that independent contract carriers are unable or unwilling to perform the same type of service as specific motor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.245" offset="8264391">So we think its clear from the statute the history and from even this Court's pattern recognition that such a factor and such of showing must be considered by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.871" offset="8326875">That leads us to the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="2063.199" offset="8356133">Mr. Justice Harlan, the United States and the Commission differ on the manner in which the Commission treated the criterion of the effect of granting the permit on the protesting -- existing protesting carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.621" offset="8433873">The Commission found that granting the permit would adversely affect the existing carriers in the field who are able to handle the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.888" offset="8482879">The United States quarrels with the Commission there because in their view, the Commission made such a finding on the basis of a presumption without relating it to specific facts of harm or detriment in this record and that --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="2115.492" offset="8565321">But as far as your present argument has gone, you are in agreement, is that it?</text>

            <label>Mr. B. Franklin Taylor, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2119.925" offset="8583084">So far as our view of the legislative history and what it accomplished, United States and the Commission is generally in agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.751" offset="8618402">So far as the ability of the Commission to consider a -- an affirmative showing by a protestant that it's able and willing to meet the shipper's requirements, we're in agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.669" offset="8662079">And so far as the manner in which the Commission treated, the affect on the supporting shipper of a denial of the contract carrier application, the United States agrees with the Commission that the Commission's treatment of it was correct and that the District Court erred in saying (1) That we had imposed an unfair burden of proof on the applicant and its shipper, (2) That we had not considered the distinct needs and requirements of the shipper and (3) The Commission had not made adequate findings to reflect those distinct needs, all of which the Court took the Commission to task for it, but we maintain that the Commission's findings were adequate and that the United States agrees with us on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.089" offset="8871685">So our difference is quite narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.224" offset="8900315">The appellees, JT and the Contract Carriers' Conference and the District Court would find in the legislative history of the 1957 amendments, a clear indication on the -- or intention on the part of Congress to prohibit the Commission from considering a showing by common carriers that they can and will provide adequate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.205" offset="9008149">And of course, it's -- I've discussed in an answer to a question by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, these amendments did not -- are not to be viewed in the vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.237" offset="9056319">There has been a history of the motor carrier regulation as this Court has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.258" offset="9080456">It was passed for distinct purpose to stabilize the industry to take care of unsatisfactory economic conditions caused by overcrowding, over competition and unstable great picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.965" offset="9135208">We also point out in some detail in our brief that one of the purposes and the fundamental objective of motor carrier regulation was to foster, promote and protect adequate common carrier service and that was one of the reasons why contract carriers were placed under the regulation, that that was a purpose of the Motor Carrier Act and continues to be a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.572" offset="9245654">I think it's supported by Congress in the same session at which passed the 1957 Amendments in dealing with amendments to -- another part of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.967" offset="9299257">The same House and Senate Committees that dealt with the 1957 Amendments we're concerned with here, said at one point in its report, this very thing that a purpose, a fundamental purpose of motor carrier regulation is to promote and protect common carrier service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.589" offset="9381700">So, we think these two threats must be considered when we view the 1957 Amendments themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.331" offset="9428720">The precise impetus for the 1957 Amendments was this Court's decision in the United States, the Contract Steel Carriers, 350 U.S. at page 409, which decision apparent to make possible the proliferation of contract carrier services in competition with common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.760" offset="9518373">In that case, the Court held that the contract carriers were free to aggressively search for a new business and enter into new and more contracts within the scope of their permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.546" offset="9577514">The result was that the line between common and contract carrier which is essentially in terms of holding out, the common carrier holds out to provide its services to the general public or anybody that can use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.394" offset="9628923">The contract carrier has no such holding out but only provides a service to the shipper with whom it executes a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.616" offset="9669883">And by a contract carrier being able to enter into many, many contracts, it was reaching the point where it was essentially holding out its service to any and all and consequently, the line between common and contract carrier is becoming (Inaudible).</text>
