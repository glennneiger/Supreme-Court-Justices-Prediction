            <label>Mr. George H. Mason</label>
            <text syncTime="15.976" offset="167267">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.479" offset="181269">The federal law here involved is Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act with the subject of consideration by this Court in Lincoln Mills in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.477" offset="241246">The principal issue presented here is whether Section 301 preempted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts, that field of litigation involving collective bargaining contracts where interstate commerce would be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.609" offset="341765">The case comes here in the following manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.905" offset="350960">I shall refer to the petitioner here, the defendant in the lower court action of the company and the respondent here is the union for convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.457" offset="401220">The union brought a suit to the Massachusetts Court to enforce an alleged collective bargaining agreement essentially claiming a refusal by the company to comply with the terms of an executed agreement, allegedly executed agreement, an improper termination of that contract by the company and sought as relief an injunction against the termination of the contract by the company, specific performance of the entire agreement, a declaratory judgment and damages for the violation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.623" offset="573837">The action was brought by the union -- International Union, United Steelworkers of America through a representative of the international by the local charted by the international.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.644" offset="637994">On behalf of the organizations themselves and of the individual members of those organizations -- for the action can only be instituted as a class suit in Massachusetts, so which does not recognize at the end of the theory with reference to unincorporated organization such as labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.643" offset="737991">The company filed a demurrer in the action setting up specifically that Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act deprived the state court of jurisdiction in a suit between a labor organization and an employer for violation of a collective contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.799" offset="842585">The company incidentally denied the validity of the agreement that was in issue and determined adversely to the company.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="199.949" offset="903189">That is it was signed by agents not authorized to act --</text>

          <turn speaker="george_h_mason" startTime="203.879" stopTime="988.312">
            <label>Mr. George H. Mason</label>
            <text syncTime="203.879" offset="918862">That was one of the defenses raised by the company as to the invalidity of the -- with reference to the validity of the collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.992" offset="967346">The company also filed a motion at some stage in the proceedings to dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction alleging the same ground as it did in the demurrer.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.536" offset="1009560">The demurrer and the motion was -- the demurrer was overruled and motion was denied by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.131" offset="1043937">A filed decree was entered in the lower court declaring the agreement valid and binding on the parties and directing payment of specific amounts to individual members of the union in the form of wages alleged to be due under this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.331" offset="1132648">Now, I might point out here that the original action sought specific performance of the entire contracts which had many clauses in it -- with reference to union rights qua union such as recognition of the union, union shop, check off, as well as claiming violation of rights which would result in money damages to the individual members for wages alleged to be due.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.512" offset="1261380">But the -- by the time the filed decree was entered in 1960, the original contract had expired, so that the question of specific performance of the expired contracts had become moot and the only relief therefore which the Court afforded to the union was to grant the money damages which was alleged to be due under that expired contract or the duration of that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.410" offset="1388962">The company appealed from the interlocutory decrees -- decree overruling the demurrer of the company in which it alleged no jurisdiction of the state court and from the lower court's motion to -- denial of the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction and from the final decree, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the rulings of the lower court in essence holding that the state court did have jurisdiction, not withstanding Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act that the Taft-Hartley -- the three -- Section 301 did not establish any exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.601" offset="1593762">Now, it may be of interest on the -- as the case arises here that in the findings of fact which are undisputed now in this case, there was a finding in the lower court that the company sells a substantial part of its product and purchases a substantial part of its supplies in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.898" offset="1678921">So I don't think there's any question here of whether the case involves one affecting the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.178" offset="1712044">I think that would be considered by both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.850" offset="1734823">It found that the company refused to comply with the contract and terminated it before its expiration date, and that the collective agreement for which specific performance was requested, was valid and contained the usual clauses which are incorporated in a collective agreement so that the case is one to which Section 301 obviously applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.380" offset="1896887">It was brought by a labor organization against an employer for a violation of a contract between these parties expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.082" offset="1947669">The company was engaged in interstate commerce and I think that's undisputed so that this would affect interstate commerce suit conceivably and the suit sought specific performance of the entire contract so that it could not be said that this was a suit to maintain or prosecute uniquely personal rights as distinguished from rights of the union as a union, so that the Westinghouse problem is not yet present.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.465" offset="2093223">I think it was not specifically that will force money judgments for individual members of the union although that was the final decree entered because the other issues had become moot in the process of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.133" offset="2175875">Now, the Section 301 and the inquiry I should say here presented follows in somewhat natural sequence from the Court's -- this Court's decision in the Lincoln Mills case, in Mills' case in 1957 where at least these phases of Section 301 were determined namely that Section 301 was not a procedural statute, but created substantive rights and established substantive law, and the Court went on to say that it did -- created a direction to the federal courts to fashion a body of federal law under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.042" offset="2371584">And the case further, I think for our purposes in this situation established that there were no constitutional difficulties involved in the enactment of Section 301 granting remedies or establishing a procedure for remedies for violation of collective agreements which were consummated between labor organizations and employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.616" offset="2525811">Now I think that being in the sense behind this as far as the issues in this case are concerned we come then to the question -- the next question in sort of a logical sequence, if Section 301 established the substantive law beyond a mere procedural enactment, permitting a forum for enforcement of collective contracts in the federal courts and if this was constitutionally within the province of Congress to so enact in establishing a national labor policy, then I think it must be assumed that there – if there is no constitutional impediment to the interpretation and application of Section 301 as set forth in the Lincoln Mills case, then it must be assumed, I submit, that it was within the constitutional power of Congress to have granted exclusive jurisdiction for the enforcement of these rights to the federal courts if it so fit which would then bring us to the customary but often difficult question of proving the legislative intent in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.060" offset="2895600">Then it becomes in this case a matter of interpretation of Section 301 as to whether Congress intended or the general pattern of this legislation and the general purpose of it would require an interpretation fairly that exclusive jurisdiction was vested in the federal courts when Section 301 was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.093" offset="3027780">It might be helpful to orient ourselves to read the specific provision of 301 to the effect that Section (a), that suits for violation of contracts between an employer and labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this Act or between any such labor organizations may be brought in any District Court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties without respect for the amount of controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.327" offset="3176678">And it would seem that the specific statutory language and the general pattern of the legislation would in the first instance be the primary source to inquiring the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.359" offset="3244805">And one of the arguments that has been made with reference to this question of whether there is exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts or concurrent jurisdiction in both the federal and state courts as a result of Section 301 is that the word “may” is used that suits may be brought in any District Court which is not the language of a mandatory exclusive jurisdiction normally perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.347" offset="3364760">But I submit that dramatically the “may” in this statute or in this clause is permissive to the federal courts without regard to the amount of controversy or the citizenship of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.855" offset="3438843">In other words, it's permissive to the federal courts to act regardless of these restrictions which would otherwise apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.466" offset="3469249">It is not permissive necessarily with respect to federal jurisdiction vis-à-vis state jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.989" offset="3499342">I think this would be a fair use of the -- or analysis of the word “may” grammatically in this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.005" offset="3527346">But going beyond that language analysis, if we look at the pattern of the legislation itself, the Taft-Hartley Act, I think it becomes somewhat clear that where the Congress intended to permit state intervention in labor relations affecting commerce that in explicitly and expressly said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.309" offset="3656600">For example, there is nothing presently in the Taft-Hartley Act which says that the Board has exclusive jurisdictional or unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.104" offset="3703829">However, it's now conceded without any possibility of controversy that -- and by interpretations of this Court that the power of the Board is exclusive even though that language is not used in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.822" offset="3778644">Now, when the Court saw fit to grant exclusive or rather state power to act, it did so in express language, for example in Section 303 of the act which was enacted at the same time as 301, the language is that whoever shall be injured in his business or property by reason of any violation of subsection (a) which is the secondary boycott provision, may sue therefore in any District Court of the United States, subject to the limitation and provision of Section 301 without respect to the amount in controversy or in any other court having jurisdiction of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.061" offset="3971636">So that when they wanted to grant and specifically say this Court -- state courts may intervene in that particular situation, enacted simultaneously with 301, they said or in any other court having jurisdiction of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.923" offset="4031091">They did not use that language in Section 301, enacted at the same time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.718" offset="5734275">Lincoln Mills' decision holds that 301 creates a substantive law and this being a federal law under Article VI of the Supreme Law Constitutional Provision, the states, if they had the concurrent jurisdiction would obviously be bound by this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.036" offset="5831555">And then you find in Section 301 specifically that in suits brought in the District Court, specifically referring to suits brought in the District Court, the union shall be regarded as an entity, may be sued as an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.108" offset="5911803">At any money judgments rendered in the United States District Court shall be enforceable only against the labor organization and not against the individual members.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.204" offset="6020159">Now, if we say there is concurrent jurisdiction and that this statute is now a substantive federal law which must be applied by the state courts, I find difficulty in maintaining a consistency between that view and applying the language of the statute which if we carried the -- onto the next step would require us to say that the state court then could not render a judgment which would be binding upon the individual members of the union if this is substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.963" offset="6163205">But it's difficult to me that -- to see how you can fairly say that when the statute specifically says, “A money judgment rendered by United States District Court is now going to be interpreted to be a money judgment rendered by a state court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.538" offset="6225481">The language is inconsistent it seems to me with that view.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.274" offset="8828426">Now, if the specific language of the state leaves any ambiguity as to the intent of Congress, I don't think there can be any serious controversy as to what the intent of the Congress was with reference to the entire piece of legislation of which 301 is applied, namely to enact a uniform and comprehensive code of regulation in this field of labor relations and it would seem to us that if we are to have a uniform national code of regulation or labor relations, that that purpose is best served if we vest in the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction to enforce violations of collective agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.548" offset="9045556">I think it is difficult and even though the legislature, the Congress in considering this question of 301, discarded a suggestion that a violation of the labor collective agreement be made an unfair labor of practice and they said, “We will leave that issue to the usual processes of the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.427" offset="9149106">Even that position did not remove suits for violation of collective agreements from the general scope and purview of the Act and the purposes it was designed to attain namely to reduce or minimize industrial strike and promote the free flow of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.759" offset="9246386">Now, it's difficult for me to see how you can separate the contract itself which is consummated through a collective bargaining process, from the collective bargaining process which is designed to achieve that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.587" offset="9333739">In other words, the Taft-Hartley Act itself was very far in inserting itself into this collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.529" offset="9365504">First it says, “Who will be recognized as the bargaining agent for the employees to negotiate this contract and consummate it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.825" offset="9406673">It then goes on to say, “What will be considered proper collective bargaining and what will be considered a refusal to bargain in the process of trying to achieve this agreement” and they go further in Section 8 (d) (4) and say that a contract once consummated must -- cannot be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.461" offset="9509177">Now this is certainly inserting itself right into the contractual obligations of the parties, it can't be terminated unless certain conditions are followed such as 60-day notice in notifying the federal mediation service and the state mediation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.672" offset="9582111">And that the terms of that contract shall continue to enforce until the expiration of that 60-day notice period or the termination of the contract whichever is laid there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.642" offset="9633938">So they even add terms to this conditional -- to this contract which were not inserted by the parties, by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.532" offset="9669465">Now, the step -- the next beyond that and the failure to comply with this provision constitutes refusal to bargain and unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.027" offset="9703528">It seems to me then that the enforcement of that contract which is almost the principal objective of the entire act in its control of collective bargaining must be said to be an integral and intimate part of this whole national policy to achieve a minimum of industrial strife and a minimum of interference with the free flow of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.590" offset="9809690">Of course, this is based under the constitutional question which is already been decided, but it is our contention that if the purpose of the Taft-Hartley Act is considered with respect to the interpretation of Section 301 that that purpose can best be served, we submit, by holding that implicit in 301 was a design to vest jurisdiction over violations of collective agreements in the federal courts as distinguished in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.447" offset="10029119">The conclusion just suggested is almost confirmed not quite by the distance that this Court, it seems to me went in Garmon II, when it said that in the case involving what might -- which -- what was potentially or arguably a protected or prohibited activity under the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.910" offset="10167045">In that kind of a situation, the state courts were precluded from taking action from intervening because of the possible frustration of our national labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.312" offset="10224619">In other words, there was a design to keep control and the regulation of these labor relations as it affects interstate commerce in the hands first of the board which was most expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.329" offset="10296717">And I submit further that in the board which was most expert, I submit that in the federal courts we might well contend that they would be more experts than the state courts in serving this national policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.411" offset="10369024">And I'd like to call to the Court's attention the language of Professor Archibald Cox of the Harvard Law School who has studied this subject quite intensely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.700" offset="10426180">And in 1958, in the American Bar Association Section of Labor and Relations proceedings in commenting on the decisions of this Court during the, I believe, the 1957 term, he had this to say in discussing the impact of Laburnum and Russell on the question of a state remedy for damages being made available where the federal law did not provide such a remedy and where the court held that in certain cases involving the public welfare's, the police power, the state could act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.511" offset="10573406">And Professor Cox said the state judges have little experience in cases under the National Labor Relations Act that the temptation would be to follow state law and let the Supreme Court -- and let the Supreme Court decide whether the field was not preempted, that every misinterpretation would involve a small impairment of the National Labor Policy and that permitting state jurisdictions award damages, absent such relief under federal law would make every state sued in industry affecting commerce potentially reviewable by the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.353" offset="10732753">Furthermore, the relative and expertness of the state tribunals in interpreting the National Labor Relations Act would seem to require added care in scrutinizing their decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.216" offset="10780191">And I believe this Court in Garner too, made reference to multiplicity of tribunals dealing with a particular subject, not being particularly designed to achieve a high degree of uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.089" offset="10883741">This way, I think, I was paraphrasing the Court's opinion in the Garmon case, so that we submit that the interpretation of Section 301 as creating a substantive law to be enforceable exclusively in the federal courts would best serve the national policy of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.462" offset="12069177">There are specialized types of problems that only one familiar with the day-to-day interpretations and the words of art that develop in the collective bargaining process, only those familiar with that situation could adequately, it seems to me, deal with them judicially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.593" offset="12153710">The term seniority has taken on in it -- the course of bargaining very distinct special implications quite far beyond whether a layman might first suspect when he saw the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.626" offset="12213896">It enters into and pervades the entire contract in many, many concepts of the collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.758" offset="12246392">Union shop, this is a special kind of a thing that would require some expertise to understand and apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.818" offset="12294666">The Act itself has direct bearing on many of these contract clauses such as check off of union dues which the act itself regulate specifically as to how -- what kind of an authorization can be given and how -- what the duration of that will be and grievance procedure and arbitration procedures in the labor field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.494" offset="12405321">All of these matters, it seems to me would require a special knowledge which could be best administered by a smaller group of federal courts dealing specifically with these problems as they do under unfair labor practice complaints which are exclusively within their jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.047" offset="12495600">The point I make is that the problem of unfair labor practices which this Court has time and again said should be supervised and the Congress intended should be supervised by especially schooled and trained administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.239" offset="12560280">The same reasoning applies to some extent, but not entirely, to the actions for violation of the collective agreements which arise out of the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.090" offset="12655783">And we can visualize the many conflicts that may arise with reference to a situation of concurrent jurisdiction between the federal and state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.970" offset="12831222">Now, I'm troubled with the situation where the jurisdiction is concurrent when the case arises in the state court and on an issue upon which the federal courts had never made any declaration or ruling.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.197" offset="13416155">But certainly, in the law is of great importance in the practical application of the day-to-day administration of labor relations which I think this Court could acknowledge as a factor in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.144" offset="13487940">And if we had tried to reduce industrial strife and minimize it and avoid the interferences with interstate commerce, the more certain the law is the less opportunity for confusion and complexities which plague the practitioners and the specialists and the more chance of industrial peace if at least the parties know what their legal rights and obligations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.309" offset="13628583">But when that is in the state of flux and uncertainty, we create by that very uncertainty, more industrial strife then it would otherwise be the case from the practical standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.923" offset="13683022">We make one other point in this case about the violation in constituting an unfair labor practice so that apart from the exclusiveness of jurisdiction on the Garmon II since this was a matter which was potentially within the purview of the Act, the state court would have no jurisdiction anyway, that is the secondary consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="3869.483" offset="15581288">It went on to confide primary interpretation and application of its rules to a specific and especially constituted tribunal and prescribed a particular procedure for investigation, complaint and notice, and hearing and decision, including judicial relief pending a final administrative order.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.707" offset="15666239">They, indeed, provided a prosecuting agency and the general counsel for the labor board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.808" offset="15682644">For the this reason, the Court said that this kind of a matter not only the federal substantive law applied, but it was to be handled through the exclusive agency, which Congress had established for this purpose and which indeed Congress in the Wagner Act said was exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.712" offset="15750248">My brother Mason said that there's no language of exclusivity in there because I'm sure this Court is aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.600" offset="15773759">The exclusive language was taken out of Section 10 (a) of the Act solely because it was inconsistent with the provision providing for the session of jurisdiction of the states and the conference committee reports are clear that Congress still intended to make the jurisdiction of the labor board in unfair labor practice matters exclusive, but we are not talking about that kind of a matter here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4132.433" offset="16633083">Now, in delimiting their problem, I want to make one thing clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.029" offset="16651473">The fact, it can be in a given case and here I agree entirely with what Mr. Justice Frankfurter said that the same Act can constitute an unfair labor practice and a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.658" offset="16697971">The two are not -- or they're in different legal cubbyholes actually they're sometimes very closely related and you can't link that fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="4161.103" offset="16747813">Suit is brought for breach of that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.578" offset="16757635">There is a contractural obligation and relief is sought for a breach of that, but in fact what the parties have agreed to do is to abide by the law and there is a procedure for dealing with the violation of the law and unfair labor practice procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4179.660" offset="16822000">The two are nevertheless distinct although they may involve the same thing and the fact that a breach of contract has occurred is of course remedy of both -- as a contract matter, not as a public matter but a public right as between the contract just if I make a contract with a man not to hit me in the face and he hits me in the face and I presume I can sue him for damages for having hit me in the face even though he can also be prosecuted by the District Attorney for assault because he has violated the contractual obligation to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.737" offset="16950314">Now the question before us then is, only the breach of contract though it is a labor relations matter it is -- the question is whether a state court has cognizance of the breach of contract action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.810" offset="17030562">And that question is whether it has been deprived of its right to hear that question and decided in accordance with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.675" offset="17070059">We have no argument about here that the substantive law is federal by the provisions of Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.761" offset="17098376">Now, the first -- we start with the language of the statute that Section 301 doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.221" offset="17120214">It says that the federal district courts may take jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.462" offset="17145187">Mr. Justice Frankfurter indicated in the argument, the early argument that some interest in inquiry as to generally how statues of this nature are construed in other places where Congress has created willingly or unwillingly a right to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.746" offset="17214360">Well, we make a brief effort to investigate that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.244" offset="17232332">And the general view, which we have set forth in our brief is that Congress is almost never found when it creates a federal substantive right to have vested the exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts to enforce that right, almost never found to do so where the -- it does not specifically say so that the right of enforcement is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.538" offset="17349569">The one exception is the Sherman and Clayton Act action for triple damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.428" offset="17369109">A decision which has been much criticized, but which is there, which is saying that state courts do not have the right to enforce a cause of action for triple damages under the Clayton Act, despite the fact that Congress did not specifically say that the jurisdiction of the federal courts are -- is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.783" offset="17446536">Generally speaking, when Congress has created a federal substantive right; that right, if it not otherwise so specified, is enforceable in the federal courts or in the state courts indeed than any court of competent jurisdiction from the very nature of things, the law each court has jurisdiction over the parties who are before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.674" offset="17550085">It enforces law whether derived from federal law or state law in all cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="4741.784" offset="19070516">Congress made a specific decision that this matter should be handled in the usual processes of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4767.501" offset="19173334">We accept Lincoln Mills which says that the applicable law is federal.</text>

            <text syncTime="4774.758" offset="19202382">Look at this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.086" offset="19207711">This is a very simple case which all of this argument is about policy concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.750" offset="19226415">Here, we have a case where an employer, a negotiating committee met with the union, maybe this is the wrong place to state the facts of this case, but I think they should be stated some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.664" offset="19274062">A union and an employer had an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.923" offset="19287019">The negotiating committees met.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.025" offset="19295483">A vice-president, the brother of the president of the company, a member of board of directors was the chairman of negotiating committee, they met, they negotiated an agreement providing for a 13-cent an hour wage increase for one additional holiday, for elimination of rate ranges in pay and that vacation should be computed on in anniversary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.199" offset="19388165">They signed a memorandum to this effect and that this should be effective May 20, which was the date of the expiration of the old agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.948" offset="19431215">Then they had later meetings at which they negotiated the language implementing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.424" offset="19457024">The company in the meantime, put the wage increase into effect which was contained in the memorandum, even though as it said in its notice, the final language hadn't been worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.469" offset="19501223">It was agreed that it would be retroactive and they put it in 13 cents an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.799" offset="19522539">The vice-president, member of the board of directors and head of the negotiating committee tendered a formally signed contract document to the union and then the union was informed that the people that they have been dealing with were not authorized to represent the company, but the contract was therefore nullity and that wages will be reduced hence for 13 cents an hour, the amount by which they were increased as a result of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.952" offset="19623163">Now, what are the difficult questions of law involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.968" offset="19639254">The questions litigated before the master is, was there authority in this negotiating committee?</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.403" offset="19660988">Did the president of the company know about this?</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.573" offset="19673631">He found that she did that the responsible officials authorized the making of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.338" offset="19696724">He found that she did, was the agreement ratified by the company?</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.080" offset="19719711">The master found what it did and therefore was the agreement a valid contract, he found that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.124" offset="19743848">Now, almost every case, of course like every case, but most breach of contract cases involved this kind of a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.522" offset="19781465">This is the typical kind of finding which is made by courts which decide breach of contract cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.288" offset="19800482">Now, there are other types of cases in which other concepts are involved, but we should not assume that every breach of contract matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.401" offset="19836949">This maybe one of the reasons why Congress decided to put this into the courts rather than before the labor board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.553" offset="19865579">The arbitration decisions which Your Honors decided last year, involved a question of the substantive law -- kind of approach which should be taken by the courts in dealing with these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.317" offset="19916675">But once sent down as a rule, it has proved to be reasonably observable, reasonably understood by everyone and enforce I may say in state courts as well as in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.530" offset="19973517">The great problems that are foreseen by my brother in dealing with these contract actions simply exist if they exist only in a few cases which can be properly dealt with and do not require as a policy matter this Court to say that even though Congress hasn't said so in order to make a coherent hole of labor relations law, we must vest this jurisdiction in contract actions in the federal district courts exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.530" offset="20113533">Now, this would create a problem indeed in relation to the Westinghouse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.881" offset="20146866">I may say that this case was brought in the state court because there were some uncertainties as to whether it could even be brought in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.843" offset="20182706">In my statement of facts, I neglected to state that their only issue between the company and the union in this case, although the 13 cents was paid, the company was in fact abiding by the rest of the terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.916" offset="20227009">What they didn't want to do is pay -- the company discovered that 13 cents was too much and they wanted to get out of it and I am told that really the only issue though the company said that the contract as a whole was void because it was not properly negotiated, the only changes in that contract from the one previous enforced were wage terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="5252.774" offset="21114441">The one passed question of policy in determining, assuming you're predetermined, is the Norris-LaGuardia and that's a hard nut even though it's not directly involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.235" offset="21152266">I think you have to -- have some idea of where this leads you and my brother Mason didn't make the best argument he could make on this thing which is in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.123" offset="21191868">There is a District Court case in which a suit was brought for violation of contract and an injunction and damages were asked.</text>

            <text syncTime="5282.281" offset="21232515">The federal district court said we have no jurisdiction over the injunction part of this, therefore we'll send that back to the state court, to issue the injunction, but we'll keep the damage part because that we have jurisdiction of and this he argues is one of the problems of providing concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.525" offset="21305448">We argue that in 301 cases, I'm not arguing about Norris-LaGuardia being applied broadly to the states certainly, but in 301 cases, that the federal law governing collective bargaining agreements which is the federal substantive law which this Court said is to be applied in Section 301 suits, the federal law includes as part of its policy, the prohibitions in section, embodied in Section 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act saying, “There shall be no injunctions against strikes” i.e. no injunction can be issued against the strike on the ground that it is in violation of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.418" offset="21497083">Now, this is not so difficult as it may appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.187" offset="21512129">Certainly, this Court has treated the Norris-LaGuardia Act as part of federal substantive law.</text>

            <text syncTime="6286.604" offset="25249834">I have indicated why I don't think that's so because the conclusion that are embedded in the jury verdict from which it's very difficult so far as state courts are concerned to extract what is the non-reviewable as against the reviewable ingredient.</text>

            <text syncTime="6302.329" offset="25312737">Well, my answer to that is I concede that the scope of reviewing this Court maybe somewhat different in a jury case from the federal courts and the state courts, but I confess that I could not for myself decide that Congress in this statute decided to exclude the state courts from jurisdiction, but to allow the federal district courts who have no unfair labor practice jurisdiction to decide them because of the difference of the scope of the review of a possible jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="6331.356" offset="25428825">I just don't think that's a sufficient consideration to come to that conclusion and I don't know of any other consideration which is sufficient to argue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.814" offset="25462680">The federal district courts are just as foreign to unfair labor practice matters except incidentally as are the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6346.890" offset="25490892">They are given no jurisdiction under the National Labor Relations Act other than -- and I'm talking about the National Labor Relations Act not the Labor Management Relations Act, the part which deals with the labor board, other than to hear cases for temporary relief and really the treatment of Congress as dealing with those cases is illustrative because you go in and if you allege that there is sufficient cause to believe that there maybe an unfair labor practice, you go in and you ask the district judge for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6378.331" offset="25616697">Indeed, the General Counsel in the case where this is so provided in 10 (l) of the Act is required to go in and ask for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6385.384" offset="25644910">The injunction is issued but that District Court never decides the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6389.341" offset="25660688">It goes to the Board, the Board decides it and very gratefully decides it differently than what the general counsel argues in the nature of things that he doesn't win all of these cases, and the Court of Appeals decides in a completely independent proceeding from the federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6402.888" offset="25714918">So I suggest that all of the arguments for federal, exclusive federal jurisdiction here and there are some good ones are arguments which really go to the proposition that Congress should have really made this an unfair labor practice, but those arguments are not permissible here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6421.394" offset="25788897">Congress decided to put it in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6424.647" offset="25801958">There are equally good arguments I think for saying that the kind of issue, there are enough cases involving the kind of issue that's involved in this case for simply authorization, ratification approval or the typical case which Congress was thinking about, which is a suit for damages for a breach of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6442.757" offset="25874369">Congress wasn't really thinking about -- too much about these or provided both way jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6447.800" offset="25894536">It was thinking about a case where union as contacted that these will be the terms and conditions for two years and there shall be no strikes and the union says, “We didn't like it, we're going to go and strike.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.823" offset="25942706">And it wanted to provide a method by which unions could be sued for damages, for breach of that kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6469.541" offset="25981576">They are being sued today.</text>
            <text syncTime="6470.988" offset="25987323">I will say this case is unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="6474.073" offset="25999653">I think the question was asked by you Mr. Justice Black as to what the usual course.</text>
            <text syncTime="6479.182" offset="26020133">All the decisions we've been able to find except one obscure dictum and the footnote in the Westinghouse case, all say that the state courts have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6487.712" offset="26054196">They are in fact exercising their jurisdiction without question enforcing federal law through -- over the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="6592.031" offset="26471528">And if -- but those arguments were addressed to Congress and rejected by Congress when it decided that court enforcement was the way to handle this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6601.052" offset="26507577">I think there are very good arguments the other way because many of these cases involved complex questions as to damages, really this is probably -- that -- in this case the damage question was easy, it was back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.143" offset="26555956">Employer lawsuits involved complex questions of damages and one damage suit which the Steelworkers are involved, we've had four months trial on the question of damages proving profits lost to profit's not lost so that these can be very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="6627.671" offset="26614053">It may be that Congress decided that this kind of a question was better left to the usual processes of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6635.112" offset="26643832">The courts are used to deciding this question and when they made that decision and this is really our argument, I see no reason to assume that they said by the usual processes of law, they meant only the federal district courts and not the state courts which had been exercising that kind of jurisdiction all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="6657.123" offset="26731813">That -- 301 at -- with the gloss that has been put on it by this Court's interpretation contains the source of the substantive rules to govern these lawsuits in which I will say 90% of the law in most of the cases will be state anyway, but absorbed as federal law such as we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6676.100" offset="26807777">When you have authority -- who has authority, that law will be enforced through the state courts as it has been and it's now being done just as it can be in the federal courts and there's no basis for reading the jurisdiction in this case as -- granted this case as being exclusively federal and depriving the state courts of jurisdiction in the cases where both parties are -- will accept the state court jurisdiction.</text>
