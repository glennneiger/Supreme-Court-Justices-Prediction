            <text syncTime="350.433" offset="1505155">His property, besides a yacht and two homes, consisted almost entirely of his stock and controlling interest varying between 60% and 100% in three corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.929" offset="1551130">Each corporation was a franchise dealer for General Motor -- Motors' automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.587" offset="1569729">Don Gilmore-San Francisco and Don Gilmore-Hayward were Chevrolet dealers and Don Gilmore-Riverside, the third corporation, was a Pontiac dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.307" offset="1608600">He was also the president and managing officer of the three corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.817" offset="1626676">He was paid for his services compensations from the three corporations averaging about $67,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.180" offset="1660113">He got dividends in three corporations averaging about $83,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.671" offset="1678085">His total compensation from the three corporations, both dividends and salary, average about $150,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.015" offset="1719463">Now, the main issue in the case was the fight about community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.085" offset="1747675">When Mr. Gilmore and Dixie Gilmore were married in 1956, Mr. Gilmore was then 56 years of age and had been in the automobile business for about 30 years and already owned the stock in these three corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.310" offset="1804622">Admittedly, at that time, they were separate property and not community property under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.167" offset="1836074">Mrs. Gilmore, however, asserted that since -- well, the stock at -- at the time of marriage worth only $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.954" offset="1871182">That was 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.639" offset="1877974">By 1952, largely because of the postwar boom in the automobile business, the stock was worth $800,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.119" offset="1907858">Dixie Gilmore claimed that the appreciation in the stock was attributable to the husband's personal services and therefore part of it constituted community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.364" offset="1952789">The husband resisted that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.129" offset="1971911">The settlement negotiation actually never really got under way.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.484" offset="1989360">Mrs. Gilmore demanded half of the total appreciation $300,000 in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.862" offset="2014856">Mr. Gilmore was advised by his attorneys that he was on solid ground and he countered by offering her $10,000 for everything and that's where the negotiation began and stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.857" offset="2054771">The case then went to trial. Now, the issues of the trial were first, this issue about community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.948" offset="2087163">There -- there is a doctrine in California law, as I understand it -- basically community property is the -- the proceeds of the personal efforts of the parties during the marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.634" offset="2137945">There is a doctrine that you can go behind the stockholdings of a closely held corporation to make sure that the appreciation and the value of the stockholdings isn't really due to the personal efforts of the husband which he hasn't been adequately compensated for by -- in -- by way of salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.039" offset="2211506">So, there are -- one of the disputes was about how you made this determination whether there was a community property held back in the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.955" offset="2267199">Mrs. Gilmore contended that you first attribute a fair return to the investment and treat everything else as resulting from his personal efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.092" offset="2299695">His position was that you simply determine whether the salary paid him was more than ample compensation for his personal efforts and treat the rest of the appreciation as the product of a fortunate investment.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.957" offset="2583176">If only one party is at fault, the court is required to award the innocent party more than 50% and may award all of the community property to the innocent party.</text>

            <text syncTime="714.452" offset="2961220">What was it all about?</text>
            <text syncTime="716.150" offset="2968012">The wife charged the husband with numerous acts of adultery with various other women and also with -- with physical and verbal abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.055" offset="3003643">The husband charged the wife of having become an alcoholic during the marriage and with -- in public often calling him by all names and hitting him and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.643" offset="3049932">The wife admitted her alcohol -- addiction to alcohol, but attributed to -- to her (Inaudible) at suggestions made by him that she engage in abnormal sex acts with other women in his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.944" offset="3103117">He countered that -- that she did that on her own and his role was solely that of a bystander or observer.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.238" offset="3132374">It was -- these charges and countercharges that took up 24 days of trial and filled 3000 pages of transcript with the -- that included the formal proof on the community property show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.604" offset="3213772">The outcome -- the outcome of the trial was a complete victory for Mr. Gilmore.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.336" offset="3236760">He was granted a divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.775" offset="3242506">His wife was denied divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.979" offset="3251284">The judge first awarded the wife $9000 a year alimony, but on -- on Mr. Gilmore's motion, he acknowledged that having denied the wife a divorce, he couldn't award her alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.629" offset="3297886">The wife was held -- have a joint interest in the two houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.065" offset="3319620">They're held in joint tenancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.074" offset="3327666">In fact, they were heavily mortgaged and she had no money to pay the -- the payments on and it was soon foreclosed and the husband bought back the houses and the foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.875" offset="3362879">So the wife ended up with nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.942" offset="3375104">On the wife's appeal, the court of -- the intermediate court -- Appellate Court in California reversed and remanded for a new trial because it thought the trial court did not gave an adequate weight to the proven adul -- adultery of her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.063" offset="3443649">The California Supreme Court on the -- Mr Gilmore's further appeal, however, reinstated the judgment since the adultery occurred after the initial filing of the divorce suit, the lower court hadn't abused its discretion in weighing all the factors and not giving a divorce also to Mrs. Gilmore.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.487" offset="3533302">So the final result was, Mr. Gilmore got -- got the divorce and Mrs. Gilmore got not -- not a cent.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.106" offset="3567783">In 1953 and 1954 in carrying on this litigation, Mr. Gilmore paid out as attorney's fees and other court costs of $40,600.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.132" offset="3615848">He claimed the deduction for those payments on his return as ordinary necessary expenses of conserving income-producing property.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.172" offset="3656077">The Commissioner disallowed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.679" offset="3662137">He brought suit in the Court of Claims for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.903" offset="3671019">The Court of Claims held that 80% of the total fees could be deducted under Section 23 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="901.544" offset="3709576">I might explain what the 80% is.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.232" offset="3720338">The costs were all lump together.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.923" offset="3727026">They weren't segregated, I mean, services or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.974" offset="3743222">The allocation was arrived at by judging the relative importance of the several objects sought to be achieved in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.371" offset="3772897">Now, there are perhaps five objects to be -- to be achieved in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.500" offset="3793377">The two were treated as not being the basis for a deduction, were the object of terminating the marriage relationship and the object of defeating the wife's claims to alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.430" offset="3845099">The purposes at the trial that it thought warranted a deduction for the expenses allocated to them was the purpose to establish that there was no community property to establish that if there was community property, the wife being at fault should be awarded only a minor part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.254" offset="3924407">And finally, the purpose at the trial by refuting the wife's charges against him to minimize the impact on his reputation which he allegedly feared might cost General Motors to cancel his franchises.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.011" offset="3999431">So we have a finding in $32,000 of the total was allocable to the purposes of defeating the claims to community property and to protecting his reputation against these charges that had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.833" offset="4062751">The Court of Claims in allowing the deduction doesn't deny that the origin of the claims being having originated entirely from the marriage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.931" offset="4219068">In finding the -- that the expenses were deductible, the Court of Claims did not deny that the wife's claims having arisen for marriage relationship were personal in origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.615" offset="4273821">The nexus it found between the expense and the income-producing property was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.768" offset="4302451">If the wife succeeded in her claims and if the wife were awarded $300,000, which was her initial claim either in cash or in stock, either way he would have to dispose a large part of his controlling interest in these corporations either directly to her or by selling to raise the money to give to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.359" offset="4392835">That further created the risk that the change of the capital ownership might cost General Motors to cancel the franchise if indeed it hadn't already cancelled the franchise because of the publicity given to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.739" offset="4450304">Therefore, he would be out of the job, this very lucrative and, by his own assertion, overpaid job as president of the three corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.117" offset="4499832">In short, because the -- the -- the assertion of the claim, if it were upheld then adverse judgment entered would have expended itself upon property that he held for the production of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.952" offset="4559182">The fact that the property -- the only property had yet was income-producing property may be expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.234" offset="4604322">Now, I would first very briefly like -- like -- well let me -- let me simply say that the decisions of this Court have established that 23 (a) (1) and (a) (2) really served no different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.367" offset="4676838">23 (a) (1) is trade or business expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.212" offset="4688227">Trade or business was limited by some earlier decisions of the Court to a very narrowly defined time of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.300" offset="4716544">You had to be engaged in a full time occupation to be allowed expenses of any profit making activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.202" offset="4744129">Not all business transactions, the Court said were deductible under 23 (a) (1) alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.563" offset="4777671">23 (a) (2) was added in 1942 for the purpose of removing that limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.728" offset="4798255">Any income-producing activities even though sporadic such -- or not of a kind formerly thought to be a true trade or business, such as managing your own investments are now a basis for deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.477" offset="4861262">In fact, the Court of Claims since it relies upon the threat to his job and since the job is a trade or business its decisions might as well be placed under 23 (a) (1) as under (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.028" offset="4907447">I will talk of all of the expenses as business expenses without distinguishing between the two subsections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.400" offset="4932942">The question is how you decide whether an expense is resisting a liability or compromising it, is personal on the one hand or business on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.329" offset="4972648">What is the aspect of the expense that determines its characterization?</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.545" offset="5065540">The Regulations 1 (11) -- this -- this history by the way is not on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.550" offset="5085602">I just discovered it apparently in the oral argument. Regulations 1 (11) issued in 1943 had provided flatly that attorney's fees paid in a suit for separation are not deductible from gross income and that with no exceptions, there was no qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.376" offset="5164910">In two Tax Court decisions, Gale v. Commissioner, 13 Tax Court and Lamont v. Commissioner also a 13 Tax Court, the full Tax Court said, “well in case of the wise expenses of getting an agreement to pay her periodic payments as alimony, her expenses allocatable to that are deductible because the statute makes periodic payments of income to the wife, that's Section 23 (k), taxes to the wife periodic payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.656" offset="5286013">Therefore, her -- her extent in getting periodic payments has to be allowed as a deduction under Section 23 (a) (2) as an expense incurred for the production or collection of the income since the statute makes alimony income to her, solely that.</text>
