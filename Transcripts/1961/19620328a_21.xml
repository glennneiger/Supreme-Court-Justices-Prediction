            <text syncTime="138.945" offset="659101">The -- the assertion that there is community property is in this case and I say that's personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.810" offset="678640">That derived from the marriage relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.956" offset="691179">If you can see that there is community property which is true in the Fifth Circuit case, the Owens case and that it is simply a matter of dividing, I would say the expenses are capital not that that they're nondeductible because they're capital and not because they're personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.124" offset="747917">They're nondeductible either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.493" offset="757321">Actually, I think you'll find that the Patrick case involves more of the capital problem than this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.079" offset="779682">Now, I think the principle that you look to the source and nature of the claim and not to the consequences is as firmly established by the decisions of this Court that is possible for any doctrine of tax law to be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.185" offset="836106">One of the earliest tax cases on business expenses is the Kornhauser case decided back in 278, I believe, U.S. it's cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.696" offset="882186">That involved the converse situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.839" offset="894725">A -- the taxpayer was formerly the partner of a law office.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.328" offset="908727">After he resigned from the partnership, he was sued by his former partner claiming that he'd received fees for services that perform -- during the partnership for which he was required to account to the other partner that he has been receiving in a form of a stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.235" offset="980302">The Bureau of Internal Revenue argued that he was no longer in the business and that he was really just defending some property he happened to own, the stock and therefore, the expense is capital or personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.856" offset="1034846">I'm happy to say that the Solicitor General disassociated himself from that argument and filed a brief taking the other view.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.697" offset="1062118">The Court held that since the claim asserted arose from his former business activities, the expense of defending it were deductible and the fact that the claim would expend itself only what -- on what was now personal assets was irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.334" offset="1136724">Now, more directly in point is the recent decision in the Lykes case which involved this side of the coin -- Lykes, that's in 343 U.S., a gift tax deficiency was asserted against Mr. Lykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.369" offset="1192835">Mr. Lykes is the president of a family owned corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.263" offset="1204433">He made gifts of stock in that corporation to his wife and children and reported them for gift tax purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.681" offset="1230137">The Commissioner thought he'd under valued the stock and asserted a deficiency of $150,000 based on the issue evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.942" offset="1259186">The issue evaluation went to the Tax Court and is finally settled by agreement by paying the $15,000 additional deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.259" offset="1292413">Now, Mr. Lykes claimed the deduction under the same provision involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.727" offset="1310281">One of his arguments was that if he'd have to pay $150,000, he would've had to liquidate his remaining holdings in the family corporation which was the main source of income and therefore, it's a direct and immediate threat on his income producing property.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.798" offset="1378513">This Court said in an unmistakably clear terms that it is solely the source and nature of the claim and it makes no difference that if you just -- the defense is unsuccessful, it will consume income producing property.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.521" offset="1441416">I might say that this seems to me -- obviously necessary result.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.234" offset="1460328">Once you consider the corollary problem which you have a claim arising from business transaction, does it make a difference that you've retired and all of the property you have is personal property like home, life insurance policies, there is no threat to your income producing activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.496" offset="1533367">Of course you can deduct the expense of descending a claim that arose from your business transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.243" offset="1564296">I would -- just to distinguish the case, as you might assume a tort claim against due for personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.738" offset="1594284">If the tort claim is for injuries caused by a former employee of yours while you're engaged in business, defending the claim is equally attributable to the business activities and is deductible whether or not the judgment will be paid out of income producing or non-income producing asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.550" offset="1681533">On the other hand, if the tort claim is -- arises from your driving an automobile for pleasure, I can't see how it can possibly make a difference that the judgment is going to expend itself on income-producing assets rather than upon personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.468" offset="1757288">I would like if I may to reserve my -- rest of my time for a rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eli Freed</label>
            <text syncTime="424.877" offset="1802846">Mr. Chief Justice and members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.306" offset="1828551">I would like to give some attention to the question passed by Mr. Justice Harlan of counsel of which the counsel didn't have the time to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.773" offset="1890513">The question was that, as I understood it, that if an -- if a husband and wife before any divorce action, should become engaged in litigation to dissolve or partition the community property whether the legal expenses of the husband in such a case would be deductible expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.774" offset="2018513">The case of Kornhauser against United States discussed by counsel, touches directly on this subject, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.647" offset="2069922">In Kornhauser which is one of the leading cases, there was a suit by two lawyers who had formerly been law partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.732" offset="2114330">The plaintiff claimed that if the part -- law partner had received some fees during the partnership, the fees consisted of shares of stock and that the defendant or partner have failed to account for those fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.878" offset="2198862">The legal expense of defending that action was deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.816" offset="2218611">The deduction was disallowed and the question that was at issue on that subject was whether those expenses were personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.707" offset="2270229">There was a question as to whether they were capital in nature, but as I read the case, I understood that the principal contention was that they should be disallowed primarily because they were personal because the partnership no longer existed and the Court -- this Court held that since these legal expenses that were incurred were approximately related to a partnership and a dissolution of the partnership, they were deductible because expenses should be just as deductible if they incurred in the pursuit of income as to defend income and retain such (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="590.361" offset="2464789">Now, in the case of a husband and wife at California, in addition to the marital obligations that they have to each other, they have a distinct and well-recognized property relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.811" offset="2550575">The community property relationship of the husband and wife, they in some sense -- in a sense to be regarded this as substitute for what rights that the wife has against the husband and non-community property states.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.738" offset="2618284">Those are the property rights that are well-established.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.356" offset="2628838">They've been even criticized as we put it out in our brief that is the relationship has been criticized as too much of a business relationship, but in this day and age, I think we can readily understand that the addition to the marital obligations of husbands and wives has to each other that they -- they regard that they -- the husbands and wives in California regard each other as partners insofar as the earnings, that is the income, the gains and the losses of the community here concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.437" offset="2801142">It's my understanding that counsel contends that -- that generally expenses that are incurred to conserve property held for the production of income are deductible, but that's not so in the case of a husband and wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.705" offset="2902183">In a situation where they become engaged in the dispute which is initiated by a divorce action, it's our view that's unrealistic and unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.612" offset="2961847">That in California, particularly, and what we're dealing with here, the husband and wife have this so-called partnership relationship as well as this marriage relationship and there can be more than one issue between them in an action which is termed a divorce action.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.684" offset="3054111">In this case -- there was a divorce action, but there was also a distinct controversy recognized by the court below as being the most important controversy over the question of whether there was community property and that there is was -- a community property and the community property had to be dissolved which is one of the incidence of that type of proceeding, namely, if there is community property in that same action, there was this partition or dissolution of the community that has been referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.193" offset="3260165">Now, if there had been -- if the wife in the Gilmore case had succeeded in proving to the satisfaction of the trial court that there was community property, and she had a reason to expect that she would get a portion of it whether she win or lost the divorce action and Mr. Gilmore, the taxpayer could expect whether he won or loss the divorce that his wife could reasonably expect a substantial portion of the community property.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.866" offset="3442813">Am I right in my understanding that under the involved, California is actionable if the Court had found that the advantage of divorce based upon the husband's aggression then the wife is entitled to at least 50% of any community property?</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.968" offset="4391267">There are other reasons such as the fact that the dealerships were required to maintain minimum capital standards and the record shows that that could not have been done if she had secured any substantial part of the community property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.704" offset="4718216">And I submit that the court below found as an ultimate fact that the expenses in the case of Barr are proximately or were proximately related to the conservation of Mr. Gilmore's stock, property which held for the production of income, a property which was I can say with the nominal exception was his entire source of income and it was the policy of Congress as I understand it and the intent of Congress that in adding section or subdivision 2 to Section 23 (a) of the 1939 Code to remove the inequity that had existed between situations where expenses if incurred in business approximately related to the production of income were deductible but expenses that were of an on business nature although likewise proximately incurred or incurred proxi -- approximately in relation to the conservation of property held for the production of income were not deductible and I don't see any sound reasoning for discriminating the dispute between the husband and wife where if the -- a similar -- somewhat similar dispute that is related to -- as much related to property held for the production of income as in this case why there should be discrimination could be disallowed in the case of a husband and wife is because they're married.</text>
