            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Before proceeding, the Court exceeded to the request of the parties granting the time which they asked arguing in this case because of its very great importance and the numerous issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.364" offset="200808">The Court, however, is unanimous of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.985" offset="215333">The time allotted is not compulsory.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.662" offset="230066">No one, no member of those attorneys, we decide, needs be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.552" offset="253576">That will be held against him if he filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.739" offset="266324">We can discuss his fees in a shorter period in that which has been allotted.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley Mosk</label>
            <text syncTime="49.100" offset="299760">I shall bear that in mind, Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.697" offset="326196">If I may, for just a moment until this diagram is placed for your viewing.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.283" offset="796505">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.979" offset="807267">The State of California and seven public agencies of California are before this Court as defendants in a suit Arizona commenced nearly 10 years ago over rights to use waters of the Colorado River System.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.532" offset="869543">We're defending the fourth suit Arizona has brought in this Court against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.811" offset="894621">In terms of its consequences, this is the most important suit in which California has ever engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.395" offset="920952">Whatever the Court's decision, the outcome will deeply affect all of the states in the South Western part of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.326" offset="956688">More waters at issue, many times over, that in all of the previous interstate suits which this Court has heard involving Western Interstate Water Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.349" offset="1004753">Arizona initiated this suit in order to obtain an adjudicated right to water for the proposed Central Arizona Project, a reclamation project which could convey water from the main Colorado River to irrigate lands in the Phoenix area.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.139" offset="1075911">In Arizona's statement, accompanying her motion for leave to file a bill of complaint, Arizona alleged the contending parties assert conflicting claims to the right to use certain quantities of Colorado River System water.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.589" offset="1141739">These claims are mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.707" offset="1154173">As to each quantity of water involved, a recognition of the Arizona claim requires a denial of the California claim, and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.941" offset="1195133">Now, Arizona's statement is undeniably accurate in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.505" offset="1213419">This litigation, in terms of its results, is a contest which will decide, if it decides anything at all, whether the water now being used by existing projects in California is to be taken away from those projects for new projects in Arizona and Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.773" offset="1294503">Now, if I may, let me briefly describe the three California projects, the rights of which are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.276" offset="1328462">This map behind me and in front of you will illustrate the location of these projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.984" offset="1371303">First, the Palo Verde Irrigation District.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.867" offset="1390843">The Palo Verde Irrigation District is located on the Colorado River about 212 miles below Hoover Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.510" offset="1429400">It is California's oldest project with water rights initiated back in 1877.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.374" offset="1468897">Second, the All-American Canal Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.878" offset="1486869">That canal serves the defendants, Imperial Irrigation District and Coachella Valley County Water District, and also that portion of the Yuma Project which is in California but which is not a defendant in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.230" offset="1560325">These areas are located, as you can see from that diagram, in the south east and central part of California immediately north of the international boundary with Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.782" offset="1610480">The All-American Canal replaced a diversion canal to the Imperial Valley which began service back in 1901 and it takes its name from the fact that it replaced a diversion route which left the river in the United States and crossed Mexican territory on its way to Imperial Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.030" offset="1703476">And, third, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.876" offset="1726882">Metropolitan built and maintains the Colorado River Aqueduct which diverts water form the Colorado River at Parker Dam, transports that water 242 miles over and through the mountain range which separates the great cities on the coast from the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.764" offset="1814444">Metropolitan's Colorado River Aqueduct supplies the defendant City of Los Angeles, the defendant City of San Diego and nearly 90 other cities which are not named as defendants by Arizona.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.972" offset="2107225">We'll have that figure for you, Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.982" offset="2119346">The cost of this entire project of the Colorado River Aqueduct was over a half a billion dollars and, I might add, these were depression-sized dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.263" offset="2168456">This Colorado River Aqueduct was initiated almost 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.765" offset="2190399">It's been in service now for over 20 years, yet, even with that initiation 20 years ago, it's still California's newest Colorado River Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.529" offset="2241494">Under the law of California which, in this respect, is identical to the law of prior appropriation of the other Western States.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.567" offset="2277648">Metropolitan's rights are due here to the rights of California's two great agricultural projects which were earlier initiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.457" offset="2313174">Hence, Metropolitan would feel the brunt of the Master's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.956" offset="2335222">The demonstrable effect of that decision is to wipe out Metropolitan's entire Colorado River supply whenever the limitation imposed on the Lower Basin by the Colorado River Compact is enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.428" offset="2397080">Under the Master's recommended decree, there is not water at all for this great project unless there is available to the Lower Basin very substantially more than the 8.5 million acre-feet of water per year which the Colorado River Compact specifies for use in the Lower Basin.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.487" offset="6893275">This section provides that the Act shall not become effect -- become -- not take effect, these were the opening words, until certain conditions are carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.945" offset="6943117">The first appears on page 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.619" offset="6949804">Until, one, the States of Arizona, California, and so on ratify the Compact and the President proclaims or two, if the seven states fail to ratify, then until the alternative takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.657" offset="7002049">The alternative is six-state ratification plus enactment by California of a Limitation Act which, and as to this we have placed that requirement in Italics on the first page, “Until the State of California, by act of its legislature, shall agree irrevocably and unconditionally with the United States and for the benefit of the States of Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming as an expressed covenant and in consideration of the passage of this Act that the aggregate annual consumptive use, diversions less returns to the river of water of and from the Colorado River for use in the State of California, including all uses under contracts made under the provisions of this Act and all water necessary for the supply of any rights which may now exist shall not exceed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.337" offset="7204760">And here we come to the two components of the limitation, "One, 4,400,000 acre-feet of the waters apportioned to the Lower Basin States by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.433" offset="7261080">The second component, plus not more than one-half of any excess or surplus waters unapportioned by said Compact, such uses always to be subject of the terms of said Compact."</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.722" offset="7322311">Article III (a) of the Colorado River Compact appears on page 4 of this reprint and it says, "There is hereby apportioned from the Colorado River System, in perpetuity to the Upper Basin and to the Lower Basin respectively, the exclusive beneficial consumptive use of 7,500,000 acre-feet of water per annum which shall include all water necessary for the supply of any rights which may now exist."</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.900" offset="7438921">The specific issue with respect to this language arises on page 173 of the Master's -- Special Master's report where he says this, "I have concluded that Congress intended, in limiting California to 4.4 million acre-feet of the waters apportioned to the Lower Basin States by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado River Compact, simply to limit California's annual uses of water to 4.4 out of 7.5 million acre-feet.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.315" offset="7620629">Congress referred to Article III (a) of the Compact solely as a short-hand way of saying 7,500,000 acre-feet per annum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.939" offset="7659081">This inappropriate reference to the Compact has been the cause of seeming inconsistency in the Act and of much confusion in its interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.040" offset="7695548">Reflection has led to the conviction that the statutory language does not accurately express the true congressional intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.082" offset="7727731">Thus, I hold that Section 4 (a) of the Project Act and the California Limitation Act refer only to the water stored in Lake Mead and flowing in the mainstream below Hoover Dam despite the fact that Article III (a) of the Compact deals with the Colorado River System which is defined in Article II (a) as including the entire mainstream and the tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.109" offset="7835773">The effect of this distinction is shown upon the map A and also in map B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.834" offset="7878719">I refer to map A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.582" offset="7889690">Here, shown in red is that segment of the main Colorado River which the Master refers to as the "mainstream," a word of art in the report meaning Lake Mead and below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.505" offset="7953429">That is shown in this map in red.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.719" offset="7966281">The Colorado River System, as he correctly defines it, is not the area in red.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.482" offset="7989269">It is the segment in red plus the river shown in blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.443" offset="8013093">The difference, mathematically, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.869" offset="8038797">The Colorado River System, as defined by the Colorado River Compact, includes all the tributaries as well as the main river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.044" offset="8067532">He so holds correctly, we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.184" offset="8084146">The uses -- the supply of the tributaries in the Lower Basin, that is the area on map A shown in white below the shaded area, the uses supplied supported by the tributaries are the general order of two million acre-feet per annum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.816" offset="8154676">That, by the terms of the Colorado River Compact, is included within the III (a) apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.159" offset="8179963">These are rights which may now exist in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.122" offset="8195845">In any event, they are long since put to use and they are accountable, basin versus basin, as part of the Lower Basin apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.336" offset="8232730">The total apportionment to the Lower Basin made by Article III (a) is seven and one half million acre-feet including that resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.470" offset="8265226">By a simple subtraction, therefore, whenever the Upper Basin invokes against the Lower Basin the “limitations on appropriations,” as he calls them, the ceilings on appropriations provided by Article III (a), seven-and-a half million in total.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.893" offset="8326980">Then, out of the main river, Arizona, California, Nevada may take within that III (a) ceiling only 5.5 million acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.063" offset="8371597">Nevertheless, the Master interprets the language I just read to you, Section 4 (a) of the Project Act and the identical language in the California Limitation Act, which is the operating statute or self limitation, as meaning that the three states were intended to divide up 7.5 million acre-feet out of the region -- the segment shown in red.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.203" offset="8468146">There is, thus, a built-in shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.407" offset="8484968">Significantly, note the main river between Lee Ferry, the division point between the Upper and Lower Basin, and Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.176" offset="8512031">It is shown, here, in blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.085" offset="8519764">That is because the Master specifically redefines the main river itself between Lee Ferry and Lake Mead as a tributary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.895" offset="8558947">He says, in so many words, it is intended to be treated exactly as a tributary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.715" offset="8586219">Now, the -- this has a number of a -- it presents a number of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.207" offset="8628224">The second component of the limitation, which appears on page 2 of this reprint, provides plus not more than one-half of any excess or surplus waters unapportioned by said Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.837" offset="8690709">The quarrel between Arizona and California that was pleaded here was whether or not that second component does or does not permit California to share in the advantages of Article III (b) of the Colorado River Compact which is printed at page 373 of the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.732" offset="8778271">Article III (b) provides that, in addition to the apportionment made in paragraph (a), the Lower Basin is hereby given the right to increase its beneficial consumptive use of such waters by one million acre-feet per annum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.235" offset="8840338">Arizona contended that we were precluded -- excluded from that million acre-feet in the second component.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.594" offset="8865729">We said we're entitled to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.776" offset="8874506">The Master decides that in our favor that, on the phase of the statutory language, California is not excluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="2329.311" offset="9420570">Let me explain this rather curious feature of the Master's report, whereas the Compact purports to apportion in perpetuity to the Upper Basin seven-and-a half million and to the Lower Basin seven-and-a half million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.405" offset="9473024">He treats these as reciprocal ceilings on appropriations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.513" offset="11925400">This argument is unacceptable since Article III (a) imposes a limit upon appropriation whereas III (d) deals will the supply at Lee Ferry, an interpretation which makes these two provisions correlative, one to another, as inadmissible since a substantial quantity of water is lost through reservoir of operation and channel losses as it flows from Lee Ferry, the point where the III (d) obligation is measured, to the diversion points downstream from Hoover Dam where most of the appropriations are made.</text>

            <text syncTime="4603.485" offset="18517347">Had Arizona's bill of complaint tendered here in 1952, which California respond, “We have no objection to the filling of this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.352" offset="18548799">We want this controversy decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.044" offset="18555591">That is our response.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.181" offset="18564054">Had the Arizona bill of complaint then tendered said on its face what the Master's report now says, that complaint would have read something like this, “Arizona desires a determination of the availability of water supply for its proposed Central Arizona Project.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.384" offset="18632913">We have not made up our minds where we're going to divert, whether above Hoover Dam or below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.924" offset="18671052">We are next to a bill of complaint on map which shows the three routes were now considering.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.762" offset="18686412">Two of them are shown in blue on the map behind me and in front of you, map A or map B, either one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.004" offset="18715355">The third is shown in red below Hoover Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.660" offset="18729984">We desire a decree that will say that if we divert below Hoover Dam, the diversion from the Central Arizona Project with about 1,200,000 acre-feet is to be encompassed by the decree and charged against the 2,800,000 acre-feet we want.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.204" offset="18792155">But if we decide to build this above Hoover Dam to divert from Rich Canyon or Marvel Canyon, the two routes, I may interject, that are now under active investigation, then that water is to be in addition to the decreed water and not encompassed within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.109" offset="18863835">That is what the Master's proposed decision says.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.265" offset="18876479">Now, if that bill of complaint had said that and had gone on in paragraph two to say what the Master says that there is no indication of shortage for California's projects or for ours, including our proposed Central Arizona Project, unless and until Congress authorizes vast new projects, some of which are as yet unformulated in the Upper Basin, then had gone on to say that, “We desire a construction of the limitation which shall say that the references to the Colorado River Compact were inappropriate and we want a pro rata wiping out California priorities for your existing projects."</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.342" offset="19072711">Point one, do you think we would have acquiesced in the filing of such a bill with a method of threshold, as the three earlier suits were met, by opposition to the filing of such bill and, second, I don't think this Court would ever permit it to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.816" offset="19122657">It shows on its face a non-justiciable controversy, one that says that the Colorado River Compact may or may not ever be invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.583" offset="19149720">It's irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.019" offset="19155466">The pleadings that came here presented precisely the opposite issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.358" offset="19176782">You may recall Arizona tendered three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.645" offset="19189948">They all involved the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.902" offset="19203009">What she said was that the California Limitation Act imposes on California a limitation written in terms of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.093" offset="19243760">There is a dispute between us -- a dispute between us as to whether the beneficial consumptive use chargeable to Arizona shall be reckoned by diversions less returns, as California says and as the Master holds, or on some basis more favorable to Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.011" offset="19311365">They call it "depletion theory."</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.394" offset="19316903">I won't go into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.831" offset="19322650">And, second, what do you do about reservoir evaporation losses?</text>
            <text syncTime="4807.831" offset="19334666">Are they treated as a consumptive use chargeable within the Compact, chargeable within the Limitation Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.436" offset="19357132">The Master says, "No, they're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.448" offset="19365177">They're a depletion of -- diminution of supply."</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.826" offset="19374686">And, third, Arizona's pleading said, "Is California precluded from the million acre-feet of so-called III (b) water?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.275" offset="19408436">Master decides that for us, too, "No, we're not precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.753" offset="19418363">We can share in it."</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.381" offset="19424946">The three issues tendered were those upon which we took a calculated risk in building our projects and we won all three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.938" offset="19451173">We're glad to have those litigated and decided, but we'll lose this case here because the Master decides it upon an issue never tendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.820" offset="19482624">Had it been tendered, it would've been within the compass of a complaint which on its face, we think, would have shown a non-justiciable controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="6372.969" offset="25595277">If the Compact has a ceiling on our appropriations, then they're surely going to invoke it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6398.064" offset="25695587">Are they going to throw away the Colorado River Compact that they imposed in the Boulder Canyon Project Act 27 times?</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.537" offset="25725471">It's written into that Act 27 times.</text>

            <text syncTime="6448.303" offset="25896626">There is a preliminary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6449.737" offset="25902268">There is not a shortage if the limitation is read as written, that the reference to Article III (a) of the Compact means III (a) of the main river and the tributaries because when the resources of the tributaries are added to the 6.5 million available under the Compact in the main river, there's no shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6468.283" offset="25976456">You don't reach the question of proration versus priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6471.423" offset="25989099">You'll only reach it if you adopt the Master's premise that these two are to be severed and snipped apart, that is the limitation from the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6480.110" offset="26023790">Now, before I -- on that very point, may I have chart 2, if you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="6502.387" offset="26112920">This chart's caption, “The water required to supply California, 4.4 million on the basis of proration,” that's the Master's assumption, “In millions or acre-feet of consumptive use.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6513.565" offset="26157641">The first group of figures is -- the head of the -- if the Compact is incorporated in the limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6520.696" offset="26186167">Here, as you'll see, no problem of shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6523.884" offset="26198915">There are three columns of figures, one shown -- captioned “Mainstream,” one captioned “Tributaries,” one captioned, “Total.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6530.748" offset="26226395">California might claim 4,400,000 acre-feet from the mainstream, nothing from the tributaries, we have none, for the total of 4,400,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6541.418" offset="26269027">The other Lower Basin states might claim the 3,100,000 from which were excluded, in the last column, and that 3,100,000 is made up of two components, 1,100,000 from the mainstream and 2,000,000 from the tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="6555.979" offset="26327333">There's no shortage, no problems involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6559.032" offset="26339453">There is in the mainstream 5,500,000 acre-feet of III (a) water available.</text>
            <text syncTime="6564.700" offset="26362128">We may have four, for the other states 1.1, but if the Compact is excised from the limitation, then you reach the second group of figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.356" offset="26408835">Here, look at the last column first.</text>
            <text syncTime="6579.113" offset="26419806">In order for California to have 4,400,000 acre-feet, there must be 9,500,000 acre-feet available in the main river plus the tributaries because the other states on the Master's hypotheses are entitled to claim 5,100,000, of this, two million on the tributaries, 3,100,000 from the main river.</text>
            <text syncTime="6601.488" offset="26509354">A total from the main river alone is 7.5 million, from the tributaries, two million, a total of 9.5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="6608.289" offset="26536521">Now, that is one million in excess of the Lower Basin's ceiling on appropriations, a total of III (a) plus (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="6614.507" offset="26561390">You can't find under the proration rule, 4,400,000 acre-feet for California unless the Lower Basin, as a whole, is at least one million acre-feet in excess of its III (a) and III (b) ceilings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6630.868" offset="26626800">The problem -- the essential on the limitation issue is always this, can the other states claim the 3,100,000, which we're precluded, from the red river, Lake Mead to Mexico or from the system, The main river plus tributaries?</text>
            <text syncTime="6653.052" offset="26715617">Now, on this matter of proration versus priorities, I'd like to call your attention to the different way in which the -- well, first, before reach that, everything I'm going to say on priorities relates to this 4,400,000 acre-foot component of our limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6674.290" offset="26800567">In the reprint before you, the one brought back is number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6678.340" offset="26816763">The second component, one-half of the excess or surplus, I don't talk about in terms of priority at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6684.171" offset="26840064">It says “one-half.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6685.522" offset="26845497">One-half means one-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="6687.825" offset="26854693">We concede that the effect of that is proration not because it says so, but because our priorities in fact exceed one-half and we're cut back to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6697.366" offset="26892831">On the priority issue, I'm talking about the 4,400,000 acre-feet, the first component.</text>

            <text syncTime="6712.318" offset="26952600">It only comes into the case in the event that you agree with the Master that the 3,100,000 acre-feet can be claimed from the red segment instead of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6720.961" offset="26987186">It depends on your deciding the limitation issue against us and as you've decided it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6725.554" offset="27005576">If you decide the limitation issue with us, you do not reach the priority question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6733.453" offset="27037236">Now, on the question of priorities, the basic rule which has been -- may I have the map again, the map A please.</text>
            <text syncTime="6751.825" offset="27110693">The basic rule which would be applicable throughout the Colorado River Basin in the absence of the Colorado River Compact and the absence of the Project Act and the Absent Limitation Act is unquestionably the rule of equitable apportionment interstate, but this Court has evolved and the latest of the cases would be Nebraska versus Wyoming.</text>
