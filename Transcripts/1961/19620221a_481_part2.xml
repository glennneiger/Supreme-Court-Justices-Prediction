            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1.336" offset="108753">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.040" offset="123486">Before the recess, I was attempting to develop an antinomy to propositions, both of which are really necessary to set forth our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.963" offset="175208">The first is, that in exercising its power to govern the District of Columbia, a power roughly equivalent to that of a state government, the Congress is not required to create courts for the trial of local offenses which have all the characteristics of a court created under Article III, judges with tenure, security and compensation and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.135" offset="299865">At the same time, I must couple with that, the proposition that there are limitations imposed as I see it by the Bill of Rights including specifically the guarantee of a right to jury in trial and the right when one is charged with crime under the Due Process Clause to a judicial determination using judicial in a more general sense that not speaking specifically of judges who have the security that Article III gives the justices of this Court and the judges of courts created under that Article.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.596" offset="469765">Let me put this specifically, I would suggest that there is no inhibition against creating a special criminal court for the trial of local crimes committed in the District of Columbia or the judges of which would be elected for 14-year terms and subject to reelection as under the Missouri claim or in the manner found in the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.747" offset="590346">More specifically and to draw for a second example on a condition which has existed for 150 years, there is no objection to Congress providing that offenses in the District of Columbia shall be tried either before a special criminal court as they were for many years or in a municipal court, the judges of which have a 10-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.511" offset="693373">Also, they are appointed by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.549" offset="701524">There's no election as there is in some state.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.613" offset="713853">This has been true for all history.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.906" offset="730990">Now, that jurisdiction does not extend to the trial of felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.037" offset="759515">I don't mean to say that Lurk could have been tried in the District Court before a judge with a 10-year term.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.845" offset="898800">But there is not by virtue of the statute and never has been in history a right to a trial for offenses below the greater felony before a judge carrying security of tenure and compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.592" offset="957733">And when say that that is not required under the power to govern in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.959" offset="991169">Now the question was put to me and I committed partly on it but I perhaps might put it in its context here, could a local trial be tried before the Interstate Commerce Commission?</text>
            <text syncTime="232.241" offset="1032338">I would say that such administrative agency is -- as I know it, does not proceed in the manner of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.235" offset="1068283">The staff takes a part in the decision in the way that it is not customary in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.769" offset="1086464">But there is of course no jury trial but I assume that to pin my answer to that would begging a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.321" offset="1108616">I don't need to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.906" offset="1123035">There are other departures from customary judicial proceeding which would cast doubt upon any such statue if Congress were to enact.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.177" offset="1168071">An interesting question which was suggested by the question raised by Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas is, well, could Congress provide that in the event of one of the judges of the municipal court would seek that his place should be filled by a man chosen from the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.473" offset="1265246">To that, I simply want to make one comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.549" offset="1285517">Possibly the -- possibly, the right to a judicial proceeding includes the right to be tried before a judge who has had some experience with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.987" offset="1335359">I -- and in Interstate Commerce Commission, there would not necessarily have had a broader experience with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.890" offset="1366915">But I submit that that case, this hypothetical case of selecting a -- an interim judge to fill the vacancy from the ranks of an administrative agency isn't before us here even putting the worst face on the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.559" offset="1457612">Judge Jackson was a judge who was appointed, as a matter of fact, after prior judicial experience, with a view to service not only on the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals but on the Courts of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.256" offset="1532426">Second -- and it was confirmed with the law in that condition.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.183" offset="2132093">Well, I think that that -- I think that one must distinguish at this point with respect to the kinds of cases that come before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.312" offset="2184652">I would say that there was -- I would draw this distinction and I think it's important in reference to a point raised by Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.325" offset="2224671">Let me put it this was and I -- I assure you, I'm coming to the answer to your question which takes more than one sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.796" offset="2250585">Mr. Gressman argues that Article III, quoting from the O'Donoghue case, gives the citizens of the District of Columbia the constitutional right to have their cases heard by Article III courts just as the inhabitants of the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.040" offset="2339506">Now, the first by that was not in any sense necessary to the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.938" offset="2359150">But more important, it seems to me that that is an undifferentiated statement that require some examination as to what is meant by -- have their cases heard before an Article III court of what kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.031" offset="2427486">And it seems to me that there are at least three different kinds of cases Mr. Chief Justice that we might have in mind here.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.005" offset="2463431">The first is local crimes, offenses against the District of Columbia Code which would not be offenses against the United States if they were committed in Maryland or Virginia or some other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.059" offset="2535633">And that is what we have in this case and only that.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.741" offset="2550366">Now a second type of case might be the general federal crimes such as a violation of the Dyer Act carrying a stolen motor vehicle across the state line or violation of the Mann Act or a criminal violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.992" offset="2623300">A third kind of case, of course, would be a civil case such as the big antitrust case, United States against Parke and Davis that was heard in the District of Columbia where it's the violation of the general law and not one confined to the local code.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.705" offset="2710235">I further would -- so that I've got two violations of local law and violations, civil or criminal of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.170" offset="2748061">Now the fed -- violations of federal law, it seems to me that they might permit of a constitutional distinction between citizens of the District of Columbia and citizens of other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.987" offset="2799365">However, the point that I would emphasize is that we are dealing only with the local criminal offense so that I say that your question, “Could Congress pass a statute authorizing a municipal court judge to sit in the District Court?”</text>
            <text syncTime="696.877" offset="2890898">I would say that it could authorize a municipal court judge to sit at the trial of a local crime such as this robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.957" offset="2943248">And that -- that is a very different question than the one that would be presented if Parke and Davis in the antitrust case or a person indicted under the Dyer Act or the Mann Act raised objections to having a municipal court judge to sit at the trial of an offense under one of the general federal laws where a quite plainly could not sit on such an -- sit at the trial of such an offense in the Southern District of New York or the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.636" offset="3085876">In other words, I think that the second question is not properly here that Lurk must show that this Court was not properly constituted to try him for the offense of which he was indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.190" offset="3136136">And the fact that a day later, the judge may be going to sit in a case, in which he would not be qualified to sit, is to put it colloquially, none of Lurk's business and none of the Court's business in deciding whether Lurk was properly convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.806" offset="3206562">And since, I say, that Congress could provide for trying the crime of burglary before the municipal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.565" offset="3241671">Then surely it can, so far as Lurk is concerned, authorize his trial before the District Court presided over by a municipal court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.429" offset="3277093">I see no difference in that respect between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.957" offset="3295169">This leaves, Mr. Chief Justice, some questions on deciding, not only questions that of course would puzzle you in making assignments, it also leaves, I should make a claim to the Court some questions undecided that will probably come up from the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia because I am informed that there are number of cases backed up behind this one which do involve prosecutions for federal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.169" offset="3416064">So the ground of decision I'm suggesting now isn't applicable to all those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.925" offset="3439052">It won't solve all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.140" offset="3447933">I was tempted to take a broader ground but frankly, this is such a complicated nestle and that it seem to me that I would do best to try and make up my mind about one point at a time and maybe that would be a wise way for the Court to go about it, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.040" offset="3515538">Ultimately, perhaps Parke and Davis antitrust case will be back here because that's when that Judge Jackson or at least one of the judges in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals said.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.441" offset="3553155">The old Gypsum case is another.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.270" offset="3564440">But I don't think we have that kind of problem before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.555" offset="3585546">Now, the answer I suggested, Mr. Justice Black to the Chief Justice a moment ago seems to me to answer your question if we hold that local crimes in the District of Columbia can be prosecuted before a court whose judges do not have security of tenure and compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.032" offset="3663496">Then why won't this spread through the country?</text>
            <text syncTime="892.960" offset="3675199">My answer is that Congress doesn't have the power which it has under Article I Section 8 Clause 17 over the District of Columbia in relation to offenses in other parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.502" offset="3745416">And a fortiori, something that is a violation of a local law and a trial of an alleged local offense need not logically be spread elsewhere in the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.796" offset="4170585">We submit the petitioner's challenge to the right of Judge Jackson to preside at his trial, came too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.898" offset="4202977">This point is not raised until the case was on appeal in the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.318" offset="4232652">And we submit that under those circumstances, the petitioner cannot be heard or raised but here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.856" offset="4262745">In our brief, we have argued at some length that Judge Jackson was a de facto judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.799" offset="4290539">And that under the doctrine applicable to de facto officers, his right to occupy the office could only be challenged directly by quo warranto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.652" offset="4334007">I do not intend to spend time developing that further in my early argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.512" offset="4357413">For the sake of the point that I seek to make now, I assume that a challenge to the composition of the court can be raised by a litigant provided that it is raised at timely fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.718" offset="4414255">When he learns the fact as an opportunity to voice his objection, then he may do it, I assume for the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.177" offset="4448110">But we submit that when he does not voice his objection at that time when he sits quiet or waits to see the outcome, then if he loses says, “Oh, I have an objection!”</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.923" offset="4503071">that I could've raised earlier but didn't that the answer is, you're too late certainly where he's been represented by a counsel and all the knowledge was available to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.795" offset="4554585">The answer that petitioner gives to that argument is that questions relating to jurisdiction can be raised at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.469" offset="4597217">And I submit that that doctrine is not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.612" offset="4621772">This case was clearly being heard in the District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.218" offset="4648208">The Glidden case, if I may anticipate just a moment, the Second Circuit case involving Judge Madden from the Court of Claims, was unquestionably being heard in this Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.194" offset="4700139">At most, those courts had jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.669" offset="4714036">This was the kind of case they were authorized to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.995" offset="4731382">The objection here is not one to lack of jurisdiction to the subject matter but rather to the composition of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.572" offset="4765654">Now, so far as we have been able to discover, there is no federal president which holds that a party before a court which does have jurisdiction to the subject matter and knows all the relevant fact could sit back and wait the outcome, and then if it is unfavorable say, “Oh, but that court wasn't properly -- the judge didn't belong there”, that court wasn't properly composed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.904" offset="4867009">All the other cases in this Court, and there are about four of them, are cases in which the objection was raised at the first possible opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.374" offset="4908910">In several, the first possible opportunity was on appeal because you couldn't know who had taken part or haven't taken part of the decision below until it had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.961" offset="4959169">But the objection was raised in all the cases at the first possible opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.240" offset="4988322">Assuming that the question is an open one, because I think it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.570" offset="5005667">Then we say that all the reasons of policy in good sense, the command that there must be an end to litigation, argue for a holding that one who knows the fact cannot sit back and raise his argument if he loses but take advantage of a favorable decision if he win.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.402" offset="5088946">This, I think, is the real ground of decision although not exactly as it was put in the opinion in McDowell against the United States, the only case that I recall, dealing with the assignment of a judge from one court to sit in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.124" offset="5155819">In that case, the objection was not raised until after there had been an unfavorable verdict and there was a motion made in arrest of judgment and the court held that the moving party had no standing to challenge of the right of the assigned judge to sit in the court to question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.752" offset="5250382">The language was in terms of the de facto doctrine which goes broader than anything that I'm presenting here this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.740" offset="5282356">But the result, it seems to me quite rightly, consistent with what we advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.060" offset="5307643">The consequences of any other view are -- are quite appalling and while of course we should have to face them if the decision should be that this can be raised at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.432" offset="5365112">Assuming that there is a certain latitude on the authorities, I think the consequences are properly taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.725" offset="5402311">Judge Jackson, I am told, has been set for more than five years in the District Court for the District of Columbia virtually fulltime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.798" offset="5442539">Judge Madden sat for at least a week in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.653" offset="5465945">Judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals have been sitting in the District of Columbia Court since 1922 with some frequency both in the lower -- in the District Court or Supreme Court as it was for a time and later in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.020" offset="5547447">There are now about nine cases of direct attack where the point was raised on appeal pending in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.916" offset="5587048">But if this -- if one is to be held entitled to raise this on appeal for knowing the facts he failed to raise it below, it seems to me that it necessarily would follow, but he was entitled to raise it by collateral attack either by habeas corpus or in this big antitrust cases by some direct motion attacking the judgment is void or some -- disregarding the judgment is void and then when it was used, citations for contempt to attack it's validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.037" offset="5731558">And this would mean that all these cases would be thrown in doubt, would have to comeback to the courts again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.753" offset="5770428">As I say, I don't want to make an in terrorem argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.873" offset="5786833">This implies that and that implies something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.415" offset="5801044">But I do think that where the authorities are in their present condition, these consequences of letting parties sit back and not raise a very elegant question like this one would be quite intolerable and that that is a proper judicial consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.177" offset="5876067">There is one other point, if the Court please, which again does not go the whole way to the constitutional characterization of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals although it brushes up against it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2398.323" offset="9696632">If the Court finds that it must go further and decide the status of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, then we do submit that it is a court created under Article III and Article I Section 8 that therefore Congress did have the constitutional power to authorize the assignment of Court of Customs and Patent Appeals judges to other Article III courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.644" offset="9829961">I recognized that this involves asking the Court to overrule the Bakelite case and the Williams case.It seems to us that we're wired in making that request for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.225" offset="9888266">In the first place, the course of decisions of this Court on this question has certainly been far from uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.456" offset="9921181">It's only with very great difficulty that the O'Donoghue case can't be squared with the Bakelite case and still greater difficulty that it could be squared with the Williams case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.164" offset="9972067">The Williams case itself overturned a long series of considered expression by this Court saying that the Court of Claims was a constitutional court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.183" offset="10020133">So that I think this is peculiarly a situation where the state of the decision would justify reexamination without any weakening of whatever it's the normal doctrine of stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.592" offset="10073736">Second, it is surely of someway in deciding whether a court -- whether the Court should reexamine a president that the Congress has both in 1953 and in 1958 expressed it's disapproval of those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.235" offset="10148342">And it's desire if it could to do everything possible to change these courts if the change was required in the constitutional courts and to urge this Court to reconsider the doctrine from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.348" offset="10220753">And while of course that's not binding and this is a constitutional question where there would be little occasions to have deferred the Congress, nevertheless, it's a reason for being willing to reconsider it, I think, in additional reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.037" offset="10919476">In deciding whether the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is a constitutional court, it seems to me wise to stay away so far as we can from these abstract, indeed, rather esoteric question such as the judicial power of the United of States, the non-delegable judicial power of the United States Constitutional Court and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.509" offset="11033370">I suggest that having in mind the words and the purposes of Article III that we should seek to judge the character of this Court by looking at four things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.111" offset="11107767">First, what's the court's function?</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.380" offset="11116857">What is the subject matter with which it deals?</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.407" offset="11132949">Second, what are the powers, and I mean external power not some inherent reality that you can't see, but what can it reach out and take hold of?</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.722" offset="11182268">Who can it put in jail?</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.619" offset="11189896">Who can it subpoena as witnesses of the like?</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.473" offset="11205256">Third, the qualities of its judgments especially in their finality, are they binding?</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.164" offset="11232005">Are they subject to review by the executive branch or by someone else and fourth, the tenure and compensation of the judges?</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.872" offset="11278817">Judged by those standards, we submit that both the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and in the next case, the Court of Claims are courts out of power with such inferior courts as the District Courts and Circuit Courts of Appeals and in that sense, but I will call roughly Article III courts, having nothing than a loose descriptive meaning in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.760" offset="11390412">Let me look -- ask you to look first of the situation as it was shortly after the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was created in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.330" offset="11436701">The subject matter with which it was created to deal was -- were -- was cases which theretofore had been heard in these old Circuit Courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.551" offset="11489573">In other words, it took over a function which had been performed by some of the courts created by Congress as inferior courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.259" offset="11540459">These were cases dealing with the classification of articles for the purposes of the tariff law and determinations as to what was the rate of duty do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.766" offset="11594480">And they were cases which have been reviewed on a case within this Court by one -- by certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.745" offset="11634395">They were clearly cases of controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.426" offset="11649128">It seems to me undebatable that they arose under the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.724" offset="11674311">And I would submit the Williams case to contrary not withstanding that they were controversies to which the United States was a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.937" offset="11707120">Certainly, it was one of the parties in interest and the other party, of course, was to first see important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.954" offset="11739199">But in any event, even if they're not controversies to which the United States was a party, they did arise under the laws of the United States and therefore came under their head of Article III jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.034" offset="11787473">Looking at the second standards, the powers of this Court in deciding cases, there is no explicit specification of what its power should be in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.297" offset="11836583">But you will find it in our brief that the words of the statute creating the court were borrowed from the legislation creating the Circuit Courts of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.237" offset="11876289">It follows almost word for word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.099" offset="11891754">And there's every implication therefore that this Court was to be organized in and have the same powers as those courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.698" offset="11926131">Indeed, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is a court of the United States under Section 453 of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.712" offset="11970226">And it therefore has the powers conferred upon the courts of the United States in the other parts of the Judicial Code including the powers to issue subpoenas and directly to punish itself and to punish people for it for contempt instead of having to refer them to some other tribunal as an administrative agency and presumably the Tax Court would have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.639" offset="12073880">So the judge by the second standard, surely, this function in the manner and exerted the external powers of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.053" offset="12111600">Third, there's no question between the judgments of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals after its creation had all the qualities of the judgments of other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.914" offset="12155068">Indeed, they had sufficient finality so that in this class of cases, this Court has reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.253" offset="12188400">Fourth, the judges certainly ostensibly had full security of tenure and compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.110" offset="12231764">The language of the original act with respect to their term was just like the language of the original judiciary act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.518" offset="12261439">The assumption throughout the debate in Congress as our brief shows was that they would have both security of tenure and compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.467" offset="12297279">And their appointments, read in the manner in which all normal judges are appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.086" offset="12331760">It is true that following the Bakelite case, the Congress did pass a statute saying that the term of judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals should be during good behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.236" offset="12400306">This, I take it, was a situation forced upon the Congress and does not show any departure from its original intention under the 1909 Act, indeed it would tend to confirm it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.624" offset="12457880">And whatever its intention was in 1930, if I may jump ahead, its intention under the 1958 legislation is perfectly plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.722" offset="12502288">Indeed, the -- the salary of these judges from the beginning was the same as that of an ordinary circuit judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.606" offset="12533844">Now, as I understand it, there are two arguments that are made by Mr. Gressman against the conclusion that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals as first setup was what he calls a constitutional court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.300" offset="12604583">First, he says in his brief, although I thought he sort of strayed from the line a little in oral argument when pressed that this is not a constitutional court because it's specialized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.206" offset="12656201">It doesn't deal with a wide range of cases and controversies but with a specific kind of cases and controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.966" offset="12687235">I submit that that proposition is untenable on its face of the Emergency Court of Appeals was a specialized court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.144" offset="12731956">The Commerce Court was a specialized court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.933" offset="12747107">As Justice Frankfurter suggested during the oral argument, it's always been assumed that an Article III court, courts that his judges had security of tenure and compensation could be created to hear public cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.622" offset="12809906">And in recent years of course, there has been much discussion about setting up an Article III court to hear labor cases or to hear administrative cases on the notion that specialization deprived the court I've just stated is contrary to the assumption of the bar and of this Court and others I think at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.921" offset="12903006">There is another argument, as I understand it, is that there is nothing which this Court does which is inherently or necessarily requires judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.467" offset="12965282">And this is a phrase drawn from the Bakelite opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.984" offset="12995271">I confess that I find in Article III nothing that suggests any foundation for that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.975" offset="13035290">And furthermore, I think that it is an exceedingly unfortunate as what we would mean by which inherently are necessarily requires judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.933" offset="13083146">This would mean that to determine whether a judge has life tenure, he would have to run through all the business that his court is -- and -- is authorized to hear and decide whether any of it necessarily requires judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.735" offset="13150333">Now this isn't a clear question at all in the light of decision and history over the past 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.666" offset="13181994">It's been a good deal of shifting back and forth between what maybe submitted to the executive or an administrative tribunal and what requires judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.283" offset="13228492">The -- so that I suggest that as it was constituted, there could be very little question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.770" offset="13258480">But that the judges of Court of Customs and Patent Appeals had all the qualities which go with the judge appointed to one of our regular courts under Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.059" offset="13303620">Then when it comes to the question, whether the additional jurisdiction that was vested in that court in 1925 by the trier of fact of that year and again in about 1930 when the jurisdiction of the court -- of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia over cases from the Patent Office was transferred to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals destroyed its character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.701" offset="13426186">Let me speak first into patent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.924" offset="13439039">We have argued in our brief that this -- that this jurisdiction is in truth a judicial power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.776" offset="13618448">And we have elaborated the reason in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.570" offset="13629628">I would like simply to mention one point because I have trespassed on the Court's time enough already.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.783" offset="13654497">If you will note particularly the case of Hoover Company against Coe dealing with the traditional bill in equity to review Patent Office decision, you will find that essentially the same kind of case as the appeal jurisdiction has been dealt with the -- with by the District Court and by this Court for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.859" offset="13750836">So that on this point, we think there really is no problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.759" offset="13770376">This leaves the little fringe power of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to decide whether there has been an unfair method of competition in the -- by importers of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.666" offset="13826069">And it does have a power to review the decisions of the Tariff Commission in that respect, the decision of the Tariff Commission then goes to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.673" offset="13870059">And the President has the authority to determine whether to put a heavier duty on these articles or whether to exclude them from importation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.756" offset="13982386">First, I think I should say, although it -- there's only been five instances of this throughout the history of this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.468" offset="14021256">Second, that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, for reasons which I don't have time to elaborate, said that the President didn't have authority to disregard the decision upon this question, which is a type of question which of course this Court and Courts of Appeals decide on the Federal Trade Commission Act, what is an unfair method of competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3519.453" offset="14181230">And one, I was going to make that, and one other sentence just to suggest the point, I think really, it doesn't differ either Justice Frankfurter from the power that this Court and the number of other courts exercise when they say to the Secretary of State, for example, you may not deny a man a passport on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.453" offset="14277151">It's a question whether later he will get a passport or whether they say to the Labor Board, you may not exclude a union from filing in charge of unfair labor practices upon this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.188" offset="14336084">I think our notions of finality in relation to the administrative procedure have developed and that this, too, would require some reexamination of some of the assumptions of the Bakelite case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roger Robb</label>
            <text syncTime="3583.873" offset="14438902">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.957" offset="14455202">I appear on behalf of the Chief Judge and the Associate Judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals amici curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.572" offset="14497625">In the 10 minutes of my disposal, I should like if I may to make or touch upon two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.111" offset="14531793">First, I should like to examine the contention of the petitioner that he has a constitutional right to a trial before an Article III court for an offense committed in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.827" offset="14594696">And second, with deference, I should like to examine, the decision of this Court in the case of Ex parte Bakelite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.533" offset="14633462">Now on the first point, the petitioner contends that he had a constitutional right to be tried before an Article III court and judge for an offense committed here in Washington in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.422" offset="14705037">We submit that trial for such an offense in the district before a purely legislative court would be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.749" offset="14754356">That is, we say that no constitutional right of this petitioner was violated even though Judge Jackson was not an Article III judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.096" offset="14807751">Now, this Court has long recognized and the Congress had recognized that the courts of the District of Columbia perform a dual function, the function of state courts and the functions of regular Federal District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.874" offset="14882879">And pursuant to this doctrine, Congress has provided since early days for the trial of criminal cases arising in the District of Columbia before legislative courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.616" offset="14953827">As early as 1838, the Congress created in the district what was called a criminal court composed of one judge who did not have life tenure and whose salary was less than that of the District Judge and provided that that judge would try all criminal cases arising in the District of Columbia, all cases in which were involved violations of any law in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.953" offset="15099173">In 1870, Congress created in the district what was then called the police court which had jurisdiction over all misdemeanor prosecutions concurrently with the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.206" offset="15156224">And that jurisdiction has continued from that day to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.010" offset="15175450">The name of the court of course hadn't been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.903" offset="15186944">The court now have been called -- haven't been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.468" offset="15201259">Now, at present, such misdemeanor is triable in this non-Article III legislative municipal court include not only violations of local statutes but violations of general federal statutes which hardly occur in the district would be tried before a Federal District Court which at least made to suggest, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.922" offset="15323094">And perhaps this might have some bearing upon the questions of the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.515" offset="15341484">That the test of the power of Congress to provide in the district for the trial of criminal offenses and before a non-Article III court is not the section of the statute which is involved but rather the venue of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.377" offset="15416926">And if Congress has the right to provide on the trial of all offenses of which the venue is in the District of Columbia before a non-Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.432" offset="15481083">Now, of course, if the reasoning of the petitioner is sound and we suggest that all prosecutions of misdemeanors in this district, perhaps since 1870, had been unconstitutional and void and that frankly is rather hard for me to believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.407" offset="15564988">We might know it also that of course a defendant worthy tried for a misdemeanor or a felony is entitled to a jury trial to all the guarantees of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.320" offset="15624652">Now, I might note parenthetically that the Court in his opinion in Bakelite characterized the then Supreme Court of the District of Columbia as a legislative court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.123" offset="15687868">And yet at that time, the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia exercised jurisdiction over all felony prosecutions here on the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.846" offset="15726738">So I take it Mr. Gressman will not go along with that portion of the Bakelite opinion.Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="3922.051" offset="15791626">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.033" offset="15799463">Now, coming to my second point, as a lawyer, I have of course an abiding faith that this Court is wiser than I and certainly knows more law than I.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.734" offset="15866337">And therefore, it is with some dividends that I suggest that a decision of this Court was mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.762" offset="15902386">However, my duty to my clients requires me to do so in the case of Ex parte Bakelite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.956" offset="15931225">I should like to point out briefly the reasons why we have raised that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.396" offset="15956929">As Mr. Cox has said in the first place, the jurisdiction invested in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals by the Tariff Act of 1909 was precisely the same jurisdiction which part of that time had been invested in the Federal District Courts or Circuit Courts which of course were constitutional courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.171" offset="16056090">Now, the Court in the Bakelite case said that courts established under Article III of the Constitution called constitutional courts share in the exercise of judicial power defined in that section and can be invested with no other jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.440" offset="16145115">But turning to the jurisdiction of the Court of Customs Appeals, the court found that that jurisdiction was advisory only.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.062" offset="16183672">Now my question is, may it please the Court, if the jurisdiction of the court of -- of the -- of the District Courts was constant -- was that of a constitutional court and those courts could be invested with none other, then I'll pray -- I'll pray can we say that such jurisdiction was not -- not the jurisdiction of a constitutional court when it was transferred to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.697" offset="16314180">It seems to me there is a necessary break in logic in this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.418" offset="16337063">Now, we submit that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts was plainly judicial, an Article III jurisdiction and it -- and it did not cease to be such when transferred to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.129" offset="16407907">Now, we invite your attention also to the fact that the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909 provided that custom cases then pending in the Circuit Courts might be reviewed on appeal by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.183" offset="16484080">Again, we ask, could it be, could it be that a mere legislative court exercising only advisory or administrative jurisdiction could be created by Congress to review the judgments of Federal Constitutional Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.710" offset="16566209">We question also the reasoning of Bakelite that the judgments of the Court of Customs Appeals were not judicial for the reason that the matters involved in appeals before that court had been at times confided to executive determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.993" offset="16655339">We submit that matters which might -- might be confided to such determination may also be the proper business of constitutional courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.430" offset="16693060">And an example of course, is in cases arising under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.799" offset="16718555">Now finally, on the subject of the custom jurisdiction of the court, we emphasize, as Mr. Cox has pointed out, that only a minute fraction of that jurisdiction was involved in the Bakelite case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4169.979" offset="16783339">And that fraction was the court's jurisdiction to review on questions of law proceedings leading to a recommendation to the President in the matter of tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.031" offset="16831509">Only six such cases have ever reached the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.633" offset="16845928">And we think -- think that this particular jurisdiction which by the way was not conferred upon the court until 1922, 13 years after the court -- court was started that this particular jurisdiction, even though it is merely advisory should not taint the entire jurisdiction of the court and should not by its coloration, discolor the entire court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.620" offset="16969853">Now, I see my time is up.</text>

            <text syncTime="5267.700" offset="21174209">And at the -- on that time -- and at the same time, there are matters involving public rights growing out of Article I which Congress can as it sees fit, give either to an administrative and executive or a legislative or even a judicial arm of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.871" offset="21254875">Now, if it does only the latter such as it -- the Court said in the Williams case, since all matters were made cognizable by the Court of Claims are equally susceptible for -- of legislative or executive determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.157" offset="21319973">They are of course matters in respect of which there is no Constitutional right to a judicial remedy.</text>
