            <text syncTime="11.763" offset="150444">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.839" offset="162774">Before I begin my argument this morning, I should like briefly to clarify the circumstances chronologically concerning the initi -- initiation of these mailability proceedings, particularly in response to questions yesterday of Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.546" offset="249605">Since these facts are not in the record and since I'm not sure that they're completely clear, I do want to make sure that there's no confusion with respect to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.605" offset="281788">Now, you recall as pointed out yesterday that the General Counsel of the Post Office originally informed the mailer, in this case, petitioner, that in his opinion, the matter was nonmailable and also that it was not of sufficient value to warrant a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.066" offset="359633">Now on the 11th of April, the mailer appealed this decision to the Judicial Officer of the Post Office Department according to regulations, informing him that the magazines that actually been deposited in the mail were not the only thing at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.810" offset="438627">These were only part of the issue of the magazines and that therefore there were great many more that would be affected by a determination of nonmailability and on the basss of that representation, the judicial office held they were sufficient value to warranty hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.364" offset="516786">And he made that decision on the same day, April 11th and it was also on that same day that mailer when into District Court and got ex parte, a temporary restraining order, so that these things all happened on -- on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.445" offset="593168">And then it was on the morning of April 12, the following day, the Government went in and had this temporary restraining order stayed in order that they might respond and eventually, argument was held and the complaint was dismissed without prejudice to petitioner's going back in if the administrator proceedings were not completed by a date certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.173" offset="700061">Now, as we have pointed out in our brief, there is no basis at all in this record for the suggestion that the mailer, the petitioner here, in anyway force the Post Office Department to hold a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.538" offset="761501">The Post Office regulations provide for a hearing, procedures prescribed in those regulations were followed in every respect in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.794" offset="1318536">The existence in the Postmaster General of the power to do this cannot be doubted and we submit that that statement is as valid today that it was 40 years ago when Mr. Justice Brandeis made it.</text>

            <text syncTime="728.212" offset="3016182">Now, we submit that if the Post Office authorities are thus require to exclude obscenity from the mails, it must also follow that they must refuse to carry questionable matter pending a determines -- determination as to whether or not it is mailable because the time required for the transmission of mail is always going to be less than the time within which a full and fair hearing with adequate notice can be conducted and if the material must be allowed that can be conducted in the mails during this hearing, the proceedings to determine mailability would variably become moot and the Post Office would be without any power whatsoever to enforce this congressional declaration of nonmailability.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.609" offset="3193814">It would also be required not only to violate this requirement of Congress, but also to a -- in the commission of the crime of conducting of sending obscene matter through the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.247" offset="3244387">And now, in addition it has always, always been the consistent practice of the Post Office Department to refuse to carry matter deemed to be obscene, unless and until it was authoritatively determined to be mailable and we've set forth the details of that administrative practice in our brief on pages 63 and 64 and this has been true as I say from the very outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.512" offset="3345429">This longstanding interpretation, developed by those who were charged with the responsibility of administering this law and then in -- interpretation which as we point out in our brief, Congress has been made fully aware of, we submit would be entitled the great weight even if the statute were as clear on its face and in its history as this one is.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.196" offset="3436126">And we submit that in view of the wording, the history and the context of 18 U.S.C. 1461 and of Post Office Department's consistent and longstanding administrative interpretation of it, there can be no serious question of the Post Office -- of the Postmaster General's authority to refuse to carry matter deemed obscene pending a determination as to whether it is obscene or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.010" offset="3679378">That's right and these cases we have set forth and discussed in pages 75 to 79 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.247" offset="3724309">Now on the point prior restraint, the contention that the procedures involved in this case, did involve a prior restraint go to fact that as I've indicated the Postmaster General refuses to carry matter deemed, obscene pending a determination of its mailability, we submit that this contention is wholly without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.875" offset="3822843">In the first place, this procedure does not have prior impact within the meaning of the prior restraint doctrine, and this is principally for the reason that it operates not prior to publication of the material in question, but only after it has been printed and offered to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.388" offset="3908942">There is nothing under this procedure that need be submitted to the authorities in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.781" offset="3930467">The onus is on the postal officials to initiate any action that is to be taken and the administrative determination involved in these cases has no future effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.560" offset="3973622">It covers only the material that has already been published, deposited in the mails and then determined to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.131" offset="4007894">Thus, the procedure employed in these cases is wholly free from the vices that caused this Court condemned the procedures, for example that were issue in Near against Minnesota as prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.397" offset="4060975">In the second place, we submit that this procedure does not work really a fully effective restraint within the meaning of the cases this Court has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.359" offset="4100786">In Kingsley Books against Brown in 354 US, the Court upheld does not involving a prior restraint an injunction against the sale and distribution of allegedly obscene matter pending a determination of its obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.621" offset="4177899">Now, the restraint involved in these cases of course far less severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.703" offset="4198170">It may -- it -- the allegedly obscene matter in this case is merely denied the use of the mails pending that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.031" offset="4231502">The mailer is free to sale and distributes this material in any other way he's able to do free and I suggest this is important, free from the possibility to hazard to contempt prosecution and in this case, we submit that the feasibility of this alternative is really quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.890" offset="4306944">These magazines as the record indicates are not by and large are sent through the mails to individual subscribers.</text>
