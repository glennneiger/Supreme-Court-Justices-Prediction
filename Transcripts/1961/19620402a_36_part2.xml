          <heading>Argument of Edward Bennett Williams</heading>
          <turn speaker="edward_bennett_williams" startTime="0.000" stopTime="122.746">
            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.049" offset="151594">I think that there is one fatal flaw in the argument made by the Government with respect to the validity of petitioner Toy's arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.721" offset="198301">The fact of the matter is that nowhere in the record is there an equation of Blackie Toy who was mentioned by Hom Way with petitioner Toy.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.166" offset="260054">The Solicitor conceded that if Alton Wong was at the door of Oye's Laundry at 6:30 in the morning without reason then the flight of the men who opened and response to his knock would be meaningless insofar as probable cause is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.874" offset="338840">So far as the record shows, there was no reason nor could there have been for Alton Wong, the narcotics agent to believe that the man who opened the door of Oye's Laundry at 6:30 in the morning was the man who was mentioned by Hom Way.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.803" offset="414595">He was told by Hom Way and in fact he was the agent who was so told another was that the narcotic was bought at a laundry on Leavenworth Street from Blackie Toy.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.862" offset="462869">I think this Court can judicially notice because it is the fact demonstrable from a map that Leavenworth Street is several miles long and it runs through the heart of Chinatown in the Northeast section of San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.807" offset="518562">The laundry was not known as Toy's Laundry but Oye's Laundry.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.508" offset="533400">When he rang the bell and a man opened the door, he had no reason in the world to believe that the man who opened the door in response to his knock and ring was the Blackie Toy mentioned by Hom Way.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="122.746" offset="594317">Suppose let him to go to that laundry.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="125.693" offset="606124">The record is silent on that and I don't think.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="128.467" stopTime="129.193">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="128.467" offset="617200">But certainly --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_bennett_williams" startTime="129.193" stopTime="210.134">
            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="129.193" offset="620126">I don't think we can reason from hindsight as the Solicitor attempted to do to the validity of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.025" offset="647502">He says that fact that the defendant ended up as the petitioner ended up as the defendant would justify there going there.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.262" offset="676446">I don't think that can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.018" offset="683447">And the record also shows, if the Court please that James Wah Toy, and I direct the Court's attention to page 36, testified through an interpreter.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.671" offset="734020">Again, if the Court please, the Solicitor said that the facts as they confronted Alton Wong, the agent, should be the decisive in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.307" offset="772577">Well, the fact as they confronted Alton Wong are well revealed at Page 53 in the record where he testified that the arrest and the seizure and the taking into custody of the petitioner was accomplished after he got into the room, and certainly it is a reasonable and I think the only reasonable inference that the arrest was made was because the petitioner reached for his nightstand.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.965" offset="887202">Now, finally, if the Court please, the Solicitor said that an arraignment took place in this case.There is nothing in the record to show an arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.387" offset="936939">It is absolutely silent.</text>
          </turn>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_bennett_williams" startTime="216.137" stopTime="280.176">
            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="216.137" offset="967868">I believe that that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.883" offset="974869">I believe an arraignment took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.627" offset="981870">The record is silent on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.453" offset="989184">But if we are going to accept the fact that the arraignment, Mr. Justice Brennan, I think that we must accept all of the facts concerning the arraignment and when he made the representation in his brief that an arraignment took place, we secured the records and the records of the arraignment showed that the arrest of these two men were accomplished by warrant issued by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.559" offset="1089599">Now, the Solicitor says, this lands itself to one of two inferences, either that there was no arrest made in Toy's bedroom, and that the arrest was not made until he was taken before the Commissioner or alternatively that an arrest was made there and a new arrest was made at the Commissioner's.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.928" offset="1175071">If there was no arrest made or the warrants didn't issue until they appeared before the Commissioner, if the Court please, and complaints were sworn to by the narcotics agents.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="282.120" offset="1231809">They had already been of course early that morning and they've taken this man into custody insofar as the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.274" offset="1260440">In other words, the agents here, the testimony of the agents, I think is certainly contradictory to the record of the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.866" offset="1298787">Now, if it is the fact that they were not arrested, if Toy was not arrested, then how in the name of reason can the breaking in of his door be justified at 6:30 in the morning?</text>
            <text syncTime="309.624" offset="1341837">And the Solicitor concedes that the papers on the arraignment are ambiguous with respect to whether the arrest was accomplished on his premises or thereafter at the Commissioner's office where a warrant was issued because these arraignment papers clearly show that the arrest was accomplished with a warrant and not without a warrant contrary to the testimony given at the trial by the agents in justifying the admissibility of all the evidence which went in.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.970" offset="1491257">I concede, Mr. Justice Brennan, that if an arraignment took place and if we accept this extra record fact that the confessions were admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.307" offset="1540577">I will concede that, because I believe that an arraignment or representation of counsel or the release of the defendants breaks the chain of causality between the illegal police act and the subsequent evidence that is obtained.</text>
