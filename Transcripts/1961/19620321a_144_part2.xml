            <label>Mr. Charles R. Vickery, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="4.313" offset="120665">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.016" offset="123486">I shall proceed, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.369" offset="140831">In connection, readdressing ourselves to the nature of the insurance policies, the tax is levied without regard to whether the policies are available in Texas or not, and the fact that the Tex -- the taxes rendered without regard to availability, renders absolutely sterile as state's arguments that it's for regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.823" offset="234663">To the extent that the insurance is unavailable in Texas, any discouragement of course is -- is without any force at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.530" offset="273533">Certainly, the respondent is better off with insurance in an unadmitted insurer than none.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.595" offset="301746">It is better off with insurance in a corporation unadmitted in Texas than it would be with no insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.620" offset="329853">They can't regulate what they don't offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.414" offset="341034">If the insurance is not offered in Texas, Texas couldn't be regulating it or trying to force it into a regulated market.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.255" offset="368410">The regulation argument is absolutely dependent upon Texas availability.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="71.066" offset="387636">Is that -- is what you're arguing now, does that have a basis in the record?</text>
            <text syncTime="75.890" offset="406967">I thought you said, it was --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_r_vickery_jr" startTime="77.124" stopTime="684.638">
            <label>Mr. Charles R. Vickery, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="77.124" offset="411878">As to the actual facts, there is no record as to availability in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.697" offset="434134">The statute makes it quite clear that they reach available and unavailable insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.730" offset="458271">There's one section in this same statute which says that before a licensed agent can obtain or purchase unadmitted insurance, he must make an affidavit that admitted insurance is not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.589" offset="505710">So the statute clearly contemplates to tax it whether it's available or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.842" offset="522742">It was not thought material in the trial court under St. Louis Compress, Tabacos, Connecticut General and Allgeyer to offer that proof and there was none offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.524" offset="561507">Now, the -- the State in picturing the type of coverage here has not accurately presented the coverage picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.757" offset="602363">This insurance coverage and all of the policies at least by types are printed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.737" offset="634337">This coverage does cover comprehensive coverage on certain personal property, principally dry docks and certain perhaps real property, principally palings and wards.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.258" offset="700374">But the State argues this case as though the only insurance in the case was a property insurance but that is not quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.784" offset="742484">The insurance also covers liability for negligence, collision liability and products liability risks which are not property in Texas but risks in connection with Texas work.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.409" offset="816985">For example on the products liability coverage, if Todd repaired a tanker say for one of the major international oil companies and it had a liability under the products coverage, the liability could arise in Hong Kong, Shanghai or any port of call in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.746" offset="898382">And certainly on that insurance, the likelihood of loss in Texas does not even exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.654" offset="925968">This -- this case does not involve only Texas property.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.676" offset="942059">It involves products liability risk, it involves risk for negligence or willful damage by vessels that are on the dry docks, it also involves protection against a collision hazard from the dry dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.040" offset="1003499">The policies also cover insurance in five or six different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.451" offset="1041220">Now, the stipulation also includes this critical crucial fact and that is that the respondent has paid all taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.577" offset="1081657">The respondent has paid all taxes for the privilege of doing business in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.059" offset="1103600">The State admits in the stipulation that this tax cannot be justified as the tax for the privilege of doing business in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.113" offset="1143829">And now we come to the taxes, what -- what is the only factual connection with Texas that Texas insist extends its taxing on to a New York contract and that is the Texas risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.620" offset="1201821">The Texas risk consists of the personal property, the real estate, the product work that was done in Texas and might go anywhere and collision risk and negligence risk on the dry docks to other people's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.845" offset="1266709">In a nutshell, the only Texas -- the only Texas nexus -- the only Texas connection if you please is the Texas risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.503" offset="1313416">Now, what does the statute provide?</text>
            <text syncTime="305.484" offset="1325328">Those we think are the controlling facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.700" offset="1338180">What is the nature of this -- of this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="311.529" offset="1349465">What does the statute provide?</text>
            <text syncTime="313.641" offset="1357928">This -- this is a tax on a premium payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.230" offset="1376319">The tax is not due unless there is a premium payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.042" offset="1391574">A payment is a condition preceded to the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.092" offset="1407770">Therefore, we think that the taxable event, the operating incidence of the tax clearly falls on the premium payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.104" offset="1447790">If there is a critic sale, if there is a critic purchase of insurance and the -- the premium is never paid, there is no tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.980" offset="1483316">The premium payment is a cynically none of the type.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.156" offset="1500035">And we therefore feel that the premium payment is a taxable event, the taxable event under the stipulation and as a fact, occurs and occurs only in the City of New York in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.764" offset="1590418">Now, the -- the statute levies the tax whether or not there is a local transaction or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.790" offset="1634513">The statute is not dependent upon any local transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.744" offset="1650395">A Congolese could purchase that -- the insurance in the Congo on a Texas risk and the Texas tax would've -- would purport to cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.978" offset="1695326">He of course, might have some jurisdictional problems in collecting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.106" offset="1711835">But the tax is in no way limited to residence, it's not limited to people doing business in the state, it is limited to -- it is defined only -- delimited only by a person purchasing insurance anywhere from any unadmitted insurer on a Texas risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.434" offset="1801070">The only two taxable events -- not events but the two prerequisites are the purchase from an unadmitted insurer and the purchase on a Texas risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.991" offset="1855300">The taxes are levied on persons, on individual persons, as well as it is lev -- as on corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.063" offset="1887587">It is levied on partnerships, it is levied on associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.134" offset="1903888">There is nothing that the statute is indiscriminant.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.608" offset="1917785">It le -- levies it on every purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.218" offset="1936280">This fact also negatives any possible argument that this tax was levied for the corporate privilege of doing business in the State because it's levied on individuals and because it's levied without regard to whether you're a corporation or admitted or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.818" offset="2010676">The only two requirements are the -- are the purchase from an unadmitted insurer on the Texas property.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.316" offset="2040665">Now, we come to the discriminatory nature of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.820" offset="2058637">Is the tax discriminatory?</text>
            <text syncTime="491.219" offset="2068250">Now the State or the petitioner has blown both hot and cold in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.861" offset="2090820">The petitioner in one position has argued that the tax is discriminatory that it is purposely discriminatory in order to accomplish what the State or the petitioner describes as a re -- as a regulatory effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.758" offset="2162395">In other words, by the higher tax, they accomplish regulation by discouraging the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.405" offset="2189040">In another place in its brief, the State argues that this tax is to equalize the tax burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.453" offset="2217148">If it is to merely equalize the tax burden, then of course the State loses its regulatory effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.600" offset="2249749">The truth of course is that while the State has taken both positions in its brief that it -- to equalize taxes and put them on an equal basis and in another -- in another place in its brief, it is discriminatory to discourage the -- to discourage the purpose, the truth is that it is discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.676" offset="2330102">The rate on unadmitted purchases from unadmitted insurers is at the rate of 5% of the premium pay, 5% of the premium paid while the taxes to unad -- to admitted insurers, domesticated insurers if you pleasem, varies from a minimum rate of 1.1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.174" offset="2408051">That's a difference of over 400% and almost 500% to a maximum rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.909" offset="2435009">The maximum rate on any admitted insurer is 3.85%.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.902" offset="2458937">The graduated scale or the scale from 1.1% to 3.85% is determined -- is determined by a formula in the statute that varies dependent upon the admitted insurers' investment in Texas property.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.787" offset="2538559">The tax, not only is discriminatory in that regard, admitted insurers are granted in the same statue, a sweeping tax immunity from any tax immunity from any tax agent by any other political subdivision of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.204" offset="2604178">The respondent is granted no such broad tax immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.516" offset="2617448">In other words, the admitted insurers in return for the premium tax on their premiums are admitted, are given immunity from insurance occupation taxes on -- from other political subdivisions of the State which is a privilege the respondent does not enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.566" offset="2697592">The taxes for the discriminatory in that, domestic insurers, if a policy is cancelled and a -- and a return premium is paid are permitted to credit a return premium against the tax whereas an unadmitted insurer is not given the same credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.126" offset="2775855">So, I think it is quite clear that the tax is patent -- that the tax is patently discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.885" offset="2818905">Now, as we move into the legal issues involved in this case, there are four --</text>

            <text syncTime="800.938" offset="3307081">Your Honor wrote an opinion in the Hoopeston case in which you said that the Allgeyer case has been occasionally doubted and in that -- and -- and in making that statement that it had been occasionally doubted.</text>

            <text syncTime="822.033" offset="3391509">The All -- in the Allgeyer decision, Louisiana levied a tax on unadmitted insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.728" offset="3430275">But the -- in the Allgeyer case, the tax was levied only, only and only if there was an act in the State of Louisiana leading to the insurance if there was an act in the State of -- of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.362" offset="3500805">Nevertheless, in the Allgeyer case, they held that tax unconstitutional even though there was a step in the contract, even though there was a formulation of the contract inside the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.353" offset="3568828">Now, the -- the reason that Your Honor was able to say in the Hoopeston case that Allgeyer had been doubted was because in the yellow-dog labor contract cases and in the right to work cases, the Court had said and said through you a time or two that a -- that in the Allgeyer case, there was -- that that in fact was a Louisiana contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.338" offset="3688678">That in effect, one of the essential steps in Allgeyer was a Louisiana contract and Allgeyer really involved the regulation of a Louisiana contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.041" offset="3739564">Now, that's where the doubt has come about as to whether or not Allgeyer regulated a Louisiana contract or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.501" offset="3769344">If that was a New York contract, the argument with Allgeyer is not about whether you can tax a New York contract or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.595" offset="3801736">The argument in Allgeyer is whether it was really a New York contract or whether it was a Louisiana contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.809" offset="3830575">This Court has never questioned the proposition that if a transaction is wholly made in the State of New York, then another state cannot -- cannot tax it, cannot tax that transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.294" offset="3892537">Now, it is quite another thing to say that the Allge -- that -- that is a -- that is the basic Allgeyer principle and it has never been doubted.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.916" offset="3927019">It has never been questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.806" offset="3934647">The thing that has been questioned is whether or not the mailing of the notice of the cotton to be insured, a necessary step in the formulation of the contract in Louisiana was not a Louisiana contract and if the Court didn't go haywire in holding at a New York contract tax by Louisiana rather than a Louisiana contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.030" offset="5219453">I'm a little fearful of the Socratic Method of -- and not without reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.137" offset="5271907">Be that -- be that -- be that as it may in getting back to the question at hand, we think that there are four pivotal distinctions that must be made in deciding the validity of this type of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.979" offset="5343274">And -- and the first of those is whether or not the tax can be justified as a tax on the doing of business in the state that is whether the tax can be justified as on the granted privilege and that's our distinction of Mr. Justice Black that was made in the Philippine case, the distinction between this kind of a tax on unadmitted insurer and this kind of a tax on unadmitt -- on an admitted insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.437" offset="5457168">That distinction can be -- that distinction can be critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.192" offset="5476185">The next is whether the tax can be justified as tax -- as a tax done on business within the state or whether it is bu -- on a type of tax on business done without the state and in the next question -- the next distinction whether it's a tax on a transaction within on a transaction without the state and whether or not it's a tax on a Texas contract or a tax on a New York contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.050" offset="5591542">Now, the State has already admitted that St. Louis Compress is indistinguishable and this Court must first meet or face the problem of whether it should be overruled or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.401" offset="5644936">The Tabacos case or the Philippines case -- the Philippines case reaffirmed the St. Louis Compress case under the sale -- same attacks that are made by the State here in an opinion, I think, of our Chief Justice Taft that -- that the Philippines case draws a very narrow boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.609" offset="5729782">It draws a very narrow boundary and said the same tax applied to an admitted company is good or as if applied to an admi -- unadmitted company it is bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.399" offset="5768965">Now, that's a narrow boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.278" offset="5776488">I would be the first to say that it is a narrow boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.705" offset="5790177">But I would also be quick to say that we're on the right side of a very narrow boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.967" offset="5815254">And if I'm not play dry from Mr. Justice Frankfurter, a boundary is nonetheless the worst for being narrow if you're on the right side of it at any rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.985" offset="5903339">The next case we rely on is the Connecticut General case which was decided in this Court and I believe, the year 1938 at least in that era.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.453" offset="5953181">In the Connecticut General, the State of California before they can levy a tax, Connecticut General purported to levy a tax upon -- California purported to levy the tax on Connecticut General on reinsurance contracts made in the State of Connecticut based on the premiums or measured on the premiums paid in the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.126" offset="6051924">This Court held with one dissent by Mr. Justice Black that the Connecticut contracts and the Connecticut premium payments were not amenable and not within the taxes -- taxing jurisdiction of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.398" offset="6120991">Now, the -- the petitioners in the course of this long litigation involved some 10 or 12 briefs and they have never met the Connecticut General case at any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.145" offset="6163937">They have never answered to Connecticut General case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.654" offset="6173968">They have never tried to meet it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.192" offset="6180133">In fact, this case is stronger than Connecticut General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.537" offset="6193507">Connecticut General says if you have a contract in Connecticut and a premium payment in Connecticut and that's in 303 U.S. that if you have a Connecticut contract, if you have a Connecticut premium payment even though the -- the insurance policies are on the lives of California residents, the State of Connecticut -- the State of California has no jurisdiction to tax and they have transgressed a well-established constitutional boundary and the tax must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.044" offset="6335509">That distinction runs throughout the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.904" offset="6347003">If the transaction is a Connecticut transaction, California can't tax it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.130" offset="6367901">If it's a New York transaction as in this case, the State of Texas can't tax it based on property or lives within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.776" offset="6406457">Now, the dissent in that case was based -- we are stronger than -- and Connecticut General has pointed out in the dissent because Connecticut General had a permit in the taxing state and was doing business in the taxing state and the State of California tried to justify as a tax on the privilege of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.768" offset="6494438">Now, although -- although I primarily rely is on St. Louis Compress and -- and Connecticut General and on what I call the Philippine or Tabacos case and although we're much near Connecticut General than we're on Allgeyer, the State levies it the entire force of its arguments in Allgeyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.188" offset="6588165">In other words, the State has lost its own clay pigeon to shoot down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.665" offset="6614079">We -- the Allgeyer case could be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.605" offset="6629752">The Allgeyer case could be overruled on the basis that it was a Louisiana and not a New York contract without affecting this case one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.855" offset="6666742">We are in a much stronger position in the Allgeyer case, very much stronger position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.430" offset="6697044">The -- and that you could over -- if a proper case came out, you can overrule Allgeyer and still affirm or reaffirm St. Louis Compress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.819" offset="6742601">Now, that is mildly a financial provisions, Judge Holmes pointed that out himself in the St.Louis Compress opinion in which he said, the St. Louis Compress is a stronger case than Allgeyer for this very reason that in Allgeyer, you had a step or part of the contract in the taxing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.415" offset="6845001">Now, I -- I should like if I might to then pass to the -- to the authorities relied on by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.312" offset="6880632">The State says at the beginning with Osborn versus Ozlin that a -- a brave new world of constitutional law was opened up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.144" offset="6911979">That due process underwent a metamorphose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.769" offset="6926399">That due process underwent some revolutionary change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.264" offset="6948446">Respondent does not believe that that is a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.070" offset="6959626">Osborn versus Ozlin -- Ozlin is in a traditional due process group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.016" offset="6991391">There's nothing in Osborn versus Ozlin that is revolutionary nor is there anything in Osborn versus Ozlin that affects this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.010" offset="7027440">Now, Osborn versus Ozlin holds one thing and only one thing and that is that -- and that is this simple thing that the State of Virginia could regulate insurance business inside the State of Virginia within the State of Virginia and that as a part of that right, they could regulate the employment contract between an insurance agent in Virginia and a domesticated Virginia company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.947" offset="7151156">They could regulate the business and contracts within.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.354" offset="7172786">And then we come to what is also -- that has nothing to do with their power to regulate without the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.966" offset="7203192">We make the distinction between regulating what goes on within and without the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.328" offset="7224717">Now, I -- I think that there can be nothing clearer than that Osborn versus Ozlin is limited to regulating the insurance business within the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.989" offset="7279365">And to remove all doubt about it and to remove all doubt about it and to firmly establish in that opinion the difference between regulation within and regulation without the State at the close of that opinion, Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out that Osborn is different from the Tafoya case, T-A-F-O-Y-A, it's reported in 275 U.S. which was an opinion by Judge Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.029" offset="7407470">And it's follows in the St. Louis Compress vein and consistent with it and it was distinguished in Osborn versus Ozlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.230" offset="7440280">In the Tafoya case, the State of New Mexico had undertaken to say that the insurance company could pay no compensation to any agent or any broker for insuring New Mexico risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.703" offset="7498167">They prohibited the payment of compensation to any insurance agent for the procuring of an insurance policy on a New Mexico risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.145" offset="7551979">It was pointed out in the Osborn case that that was an attempt to regulate what the insurance company did outside the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.837" offset="7578728">What -- what -- what New Mexico tried to do in Texas or Oklahoma was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.803" offset="7606627">They could not -- they could not regulate insurance agents' compensation outside the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.109" offset="7639855">Osborn versus Ozlin is merely the other side of the same coin and said -- which holds that in Tafoya, the compensation was outside the State and was the same done outside the State and was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.917" offset="7698996">Following Osborn versus Ozlin, they were -- they were regulating or they were fixing a compensation agreement for activity within the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.040" offset="7739538">Osborn versus Ozlin is even broader than that or narrower depending upon your point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.316" offset="7772662">It holds that the State of Virginia could establish an agency system for doing the insurance business in the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.024" offset="7803486">And as a part of that system, they could provide for the compensation -- compensation of agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.363" offset="7828773">It was limited to insurance business in Virginia and the method of doing that insurance bu -- business in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.481" offset="7865344">Now, the Hoopeston case relied on by the State -- the Hoopeston case relied on by the State is entirely wider the more and not within orbital range of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.284" offset="7920515">In Hoopeston, there was a simple -- there was a simple problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.864" offset="7938800">The Hoopeston -- the -- the Hoopeston insurance which was a reciprocal association of insurer, these insurers wanted a permit to do business in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.870" offset="7982895">They wanted them to seek permit to do business in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.746" offset="8006405">Based upon the fact that the insu -- now listen to this, the insurers and the insured were both in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.212" offset="8040260">The insurers' contracts were in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.916" offset="8051022">They solicited insurance in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.025" offset="8063457">They paid claims and investigated claims in the State of New York and they will claim an immunity from New York regulation based upon the obvious doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.902" offset="8102954">Here, the problem Hoopeston is the second projection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.193" offset="8116120">In Hoopeston, New York was reaching out to -- to make a company that was doing business qualifying the State based on New York transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.859" offset="8158856">And it was -- it was clear that they were doing business in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.794" offset="8174529">And what was clear in the Hoopeston case, that the insurer was doing business in the State is admitted not to exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.431" offset="8221132">The insurer is not doing business under the stipulation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.091" offset="8235760">And the State is very proud of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.202" offset="8248195">The Hoopeston case is -- is nothing more no less than a finding that Hoopeston -- the insurer was doing business in the State and therefore subject to internal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.837" offset="8294693">There was no attempt to project the taxing power or the regulatory power outside the State of New York and it is completely inappropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.940" offset="8335130">Travelers Health -- Health Association is the same kind of a doing business case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.150" offset="8355924">Here, we're not looking to see if Lloyds is doing business because it is admitted they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.053" offset="8379538">The stated -- the State concedes they are not doing business in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.395" offset="8400959">Now, the -- the State suggests that St. Louis Compress should be overruled because it's stayed all authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.648" offset="8433977">St. Louis Compress, Allgeyer and Connecticut General were all cited by this Court as late as March in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.522" offset="8465429">In -- in the Federal Trade Commission versus Travelers Health in an opinion by Mr. Justice Whittaker holding nothing really on the point in issue -- holding nothing on the point in issue but recognizing that authority now -- not withstand -- not with the authority in support of the respondent's position is clear and unequivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.186" offset="8572113">Now, we turn to should it be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.134" offset="8583920">Dissent -- and I say that as the Toolson Rule should be invoked in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.725" offset="8610252">The Toolson Rule was a New York Yankee case where an attempt was made to bring him within -- bring them within the State, within the scope of the antitrust laws and this Court said that a long time ago we let baseball develop believing that it once subject to the antitrust laws and we therefore will not reexamine it because the business has been left for a long time to develop on that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.556" offset="8717563">The insurance business here has been left to develop for 65 years in reliance and based on the Allgeyer, Saint Louis Compress, Tabacos, Tafoya, Connecticut General cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.420" offset="8765001">Now, (Inaudible) will immediately say that Toolson is statutory and you are involving constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.476" offset="8813275">And I say that is a distinction but it is no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.524" offset="8829471">Stability is as much a merit in the one area as the other and that the Toolson Rule should be applied to this case and that St. Louis Compress and its progeny should not be reexamined but that they should be reaffirmed because not only has the shipyard business but the insurance business has been left to develop for 65 years in reliance upon it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2441.689" offset="9870085">Now, we would -- we -- we have used a lot of words to prove nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.332" offset="9888684">But I only -- I only have a few minutes left and I want to get down to the -- to the -- to the real meat of this case and the authority behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.292" offset="9928495">But the State is asking you to -- what the State is besieging these courts to do is one simple thing, one simple thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.998" offset="9963395">They say that we want you to say that if there is a Texas risk, insurance on Texas property or insurance on a job in Texas are on a Texas risk, we want you to take that bare fact, Texas risk in saying that that gives us regulatory dominion and that that gives us taxing dominion over the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.086" offset="10063705">Now, this Court has re -- has rejected as a jurisdictional nexus the Texas risk argument six times, six times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.336" offset="10116681">The jurisdictional nexus based on the taxes or a local state risk has been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.505" offset="10145416">And it -- it was rejected for the first time in the Allgeyer case in 165 U.S. then in St. Louis Compress in 260, in Tafoya in 270, in the Philippine case in 275, in Connecticut General in 303 U.S. and it was rejected again in Provident Savings versus Kentucky in 239 U.S. 103.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.921" offset="10251055">But by so far, 65 years of constitutional history in six different cases where the issue was squarely presented, this Court has seen that a bare Texas risk is an insufficient jurisdictional nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.378" offset="10312913">Now, the next argument that the State makes -- a basic argument is that some economic catastrophe may befall, the shipyard in which they have a grave interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.271" offset="10364426">This -- this economic interest depends upon several ifs, its two if-if on which to base constitutional policy, if you have a loss, if law had escape payment, if the respondent can't rebuild the shipyard, then you have this dire economic consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.322" offset="10440704">That is three -- that's three ifs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.831" offset="10458676">And that -- that argument is also squarely met in the Connecticut General case when it was said by the Chief Justice Stone that the jurisdiction to tax does not depend, the jurisdiction to tax does not depend upon the ultimate thrust of the economic benefits and burdens of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.813" offset="10546657">I say -- I say that you cannot base a states jurisdiction to tax upon possibilities, upon visions of dire economic consequences, it may never happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.398" offset="10600991">We've had this insurance now for 28 years and it's never happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.058" offset="10619591">It's not a long time in geologic time but it's a pretty substantial for the history in human life, 28 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.925" offset="10655117">I say that -- that if this Court accepts as a jurisdictional nexus, the ultimate economic thrust of the benefits and burdens of possible acts of God or war or chance that that is too thin, too thin a basis upon which to base jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.275" offset="10756472">Now, this tax cannot be justified as the State suggested as a tax on the privilege of doing business in the State because it's levied without regard to whether you do business or not and for even the stronger reason they have admitted that we've paid all the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.084" offset="10835675">In conclusion, I would like to sum up by simply saying that St. Louis Compress was right and should be reaffirmed that the Texas Court should be affirmed and that this tax cannot be justified as a tax on property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.296" offset="10900564">It cannot be justified as a tax on business done in the State of Texas because it was business done in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.795" offset="10930552">It cannot be justified as a transaction within the State of Texas because it was a transaction within the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.640" offset="10961899">It cannot be justified as a tax for the privilege of doing business in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.845" offset="10982797">And the State -- even if the State of Texas has the temerity to suggest that it maybe ought to be sustained because the State of Texas gave to the respondent the opportunity to insure which also comes from Judge Holmes in which he said that the opportunity to insure was a great thing or privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.893" offset="11062941">But the opportunity to insure that was given here was given by the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.104" offset="11079764">If anybody's going to make that argument here, it ought to be the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.836" offset="11094706">Texas then gave the respondent the opportunity to insure the -- the State of -- of New York didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.860" offset="11122813">Texas cannot -- cannot claim the right to tax the respondent for a privilege not granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.225" offset="11148309">That is the privilege to make a contract in New York, the privilege to insure in New York and the privilege to negotiate and do business in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.018" offset="11183417">Texas is claiming the right to tax a privilege granted not by it but granted by the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.504" offset="11209435">Now, it is also possible that St. Louis Compress has overruled that New York certainly has jurisdiction to this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.202" offset="11240155">New York certainly has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.409" offset="11249037">It was made in the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.727" offset="11330330">The New York Life Insurance Company versus Head brought up that problem years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.785" offset="11354467">If New York has got that -- if transaction was in New York, the agreement is in New York, the business was done in New York and they certainly have jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2829.567" offset="11421654">That has to be resolved and can only be resolved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.978" offset="11435238">We are not seeking to escape all insurance taxation or regulatory taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.354" offset="11456763">All we're asking this Court to do a -- and we do it with the conviction of the St. Louis Compress case is to keep the Texas taxing power in Texas and the New York taxing power in New York and we are willing to submit and are submitting to the -- to the New York jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.356" offset="11532831">It's mentioned in the policies that service can be held on the Commissioner of insurance in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.191" offset="11656129">Replying to the last argument advanced by the respondent to the effect that only New York has jurisdiction over this matter and that to affirm the position or to take the position of the petitioners in this particular case would lead to conflict among the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.927" offset="11735124">And this is not a new problem with this Court, conflict of regulation between the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.556" offset="11757589">It's not a new problem in the field of insurance regulation as witnessed the Watson case decided by this Court in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.423" offset="11789040">There, the State of Connecticut or Massachusetts issued or had a law that provided that contracts issued there should not have a provision allowing direct action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.213" offset="11832195">The policy was entered into in New York or in Connecticut, I -- I believe it was entered into Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.596" offset="11857795">In the State where the law was that the contract could not provide for a direct action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.191" offset="11880155">What did Louisiana do in that case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.144" offset="11891963">Louisiana was allowed to apply its own direct action law in that case, obviously, a conflict of regulation, conflict of policy between the State of Connecticut on the one hand and the policy of the State of Louisiana on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.118" offset="11947865">Obviously, the Claxton case mentioned by Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Black a moment ago has that same conflicting policy regulation involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.881" offset="11990915">The similar case dealing with -- in the field of insurance is the case of State Farm versus Duel in which the State of Wisconsin was allowed to apply its requirements as to reserves not only on policies written in Wisconsin but all over the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.010" offset="12055385">Certainly, that conflicted or could have conflicted with regulations from other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="3536.940" offset="14251133">The way -- but prior -- for prior to the time that 2138 was originally passed, there was no tax at all paid either by an insurance company or by the insurer or by the agent when the insurance was placed with an unregulated carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.580" offset="14325739">There were taxes which were the ultimate burden of the individuals insuring with regulated carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.109" offset="14351757">Now, we've had some conflict as to the amount of that -- of that insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.571" offset="14369625">Counsel for the respondents suggests that it was a maximum of 3.85% but that's not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.855" offset="14390836">The maximum tax when you take into consideration the maintenance taxes that are involved will move from something above 4% or something over 5% depending upon the type of -- of insurance that is available or that is written upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.746" offset="14454366">Now, of course, there were the additional burdens and cost which -- which ultimately passed on to the insured and -- in regulated type of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.050" offset="14491564">So the first step that the legislature took in this field was to pass 2138 providing that this type of insurance, unregulated insurance could be written through licensed agents in the State of Texas and partially to pay for the cost of this particular regulation and I must admit partially for the economic sanction that's involved, place the tax of 5% on those types of transactions which the agent was required to collect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.882" offset="14610892">Now, this left a tremendous loophole and had an -- very adverse effect upon Texas regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.446" offset="14637119">The -- the obvious intent of the legislation to begin with -- with was to encourage resort to these agents in the -- in the sale of -- of unregulated insurance if it was to be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.544" offset="14681527">But now that there was a premium tax placed upon that particular type of transaction and non-placed where the individual himself placed the insurer, where quite naturally, the individual tended to avoid use of the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.527" offset="14733458">And it was to stop up this particular loophole that the tax was levied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.999" offset="14751326">And it was also to make these people pay their fair share of this regulatory burden that the 2138 was amended to include the 5% tax on the exact situation that we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3715.370" offset="14964903">That was the -- the case of the -- of the London company that was insuring the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.644" offset="14981935">The court there held that the tax was alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.580" offset="14993742">The tax was permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.919" offset="14999071">Alright in -- in the Connecticut General case, what is the situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.337" offset="15016730">You had two companies that were doing business within California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.358" offset="15032822">The first California company not Connecticut General, was insuring the lives in California and was transferring this risk on to Connecticut General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.066" offset="15067617">Well, I think it could be said to some -- to some extent the risk of insurance that Connecticut General was in -- in California but not to the same degree as the risk was within the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.042" offset="15119548">I think that what the Court was simply doing there was saying well, the interest that California has where it's merely reinsurance of these lives and these people have no right to perceive directly against this insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.472" offset="15169285">The -- the interest of California is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.414" offset="15185063">So I think that you would have to say that in the -- in -- in that particular case, the risk was less within California than it was say, for example, in the Compania case or in the Osborn case or any of the other decisions that follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.721" offset="15246294">That's the only way that I can -- can understand its distinction there.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred B. Werkenthin</label>
            <text syncTime="4110.381" offset="16544893">Now, one point that hasn't been discussed except in the briefs at -- at any length is the burden that's a problem related to the questions that were just asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.511" offset="16589406">The burdens on companies such as the Church Insurance Company and the Catholic Insurance Company that are amici in this case, they have said that well they do business on an unauthorized or unregulated basis by a virtue of being able to do business as unregulated carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.988" offset="16667355">They are able to -- to affect the substantial saving to the policy holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.787" offset="16686477">And they say that if this type of regulation is affirmed, why this saving will disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.300" offset="16708524">That may well be but the same type of argument was advanced in the Hoopeston case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.361" offset="16732766">And the Court in reply to that said, however, pers -- persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.630" offset="16745932">Such arguments might be introduced to the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.897" offset="16762964">This presents no constitutional banner -- barrier which prevents New York from enforcing these regulations if it chooses to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.765" offset="16814477">Now, certain reference has been made to the Federal Trade Commission case versus Travelers Health Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.295" offset="16848541">Now, actually that case can have no relation at all to the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.029" offset="16871528">The only way that reference to the case is justified at all by respondent is that he wants to argue that somehow Congress is resurrecting the doctrine of the Allgeyer decision or is pronouncing its decision that has never been overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.527" offset="16933491">Well of course, Congress -- obviously a matter beyond Congre -- the congressional jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.640" offset="16961912">All that Congress did was to recite in -- in part of the history to that particular bill that they thought that these particular cases were still alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.320" offset="17008619">But in any event, the citation or the -- or the authority relied upon are quoted in that case shows that the Congress -- merely that Congress was unaware of the Osborn decision and the other decisions that followed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.614" offset="17177788">In closing, I want to -- to get back to what we think is the fundamental error of respondent's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.206" offset="17204224">Time and time again, respondent's counsel recited that states cannot regulate a transaction if the transaction occurred outside of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.121" offset="17251871">He recited many, many cases to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.696" offset="17266186">But we believe that the Osborn case is the lead of showing that that position is no longer correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.134" offset="17299937">The Osborn case simple sets aside the statement from the St. Louis Compress case that you can't burden or interfere with what the State does -- what a company does outside of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.630" offset="17357928">In fact, the very first -- the very first portion of the -- that opinion, the Court very carefully stated, the question is not whether what Virginia has done will restrict appellant's freedom of action outside of Virginia by subjecting the exercise of such freedom to financial burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.911" offset="17426996">The Court went on to stay -- say that the right of Virginia to regulate in that particular instance, the right in any instance is measured by the interest that it has in the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.364" offset="17468792">It is not correct to suggest as respondent has that Virginia did not touch transactions that occurred outside of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.685" offset="17502124">For if anything is clear, it is clear that the Virginia regulation saying that you have to go through Virginia agents, that you have to pay Virginia agents a commission prepared, applied to all insurance transactions whether they were executed inside the State of Virginia or whether they were executed in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.782" offset="17582477">Thank you.</text>
