            <label>Mr. Samuel I. Rosenman</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- by the Bartell station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.884" offset="122859">And we were discussing the irrelevance of all of the secrecy involved in so far as any antitrust laws are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.332" offset="176671">I want to repeat that the main complaint here, what the plaintiff is expressing a grievance about is that, we did go to Bartell's to buy his station rather than to come to him to pay six times as much at Poller station and that what he is complaining of is an antitrust violation, is the fact that we cancelled, that we cancelled our affiliation agreement with him in accordance with the very terms of the contract which he signed, giving us the right to cancel that affiliation on six months notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.292" offset="356498">Now, I wish to take up the irrelevance, so far as antitrust laws are concerned of the purchase of the equipment of Mr. Poller about which Mr. Wolf spent considerable time yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.301" offset="432567">After we had brought Bartell's and Mr. Poller realized that he would have to continue as unaffiliated station, he came to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.888" offset="490872">This is conceded and a discussion arose about the purchase of his equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.879" offset="522846">I wish to emphasize the fact that it was not the purchase of his station.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.012" offset="543431">A station consists of physical assets plus a license, a studio, some broadcasting facilities, usually in the form of a teller.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.063" offset="603617">The important thing was the license and we had brought from Bartell's, his license and equipment, his station and everything that went with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.522" offset="653458">And although he's attempted to inject some questions of fact with the respect of his purchase of the equipment, we are going on the assumption as we have all through here Your Honors that the plaintiff's version of the facts is the correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.726" offset="730258">And he claims that when he came to New York, we knew that he would come to New York and that we knew that he would offer us his equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.250" offset="780413">Now, the fact is that so far as antitrust laws are concerned and by that I mean, Section 1 or Section 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.857" offset="826807">The circumstances surrounding the purchase of this equipment are wholly immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.388" offset="856900">In our view, the equipment purchased had nothing to do with the injury to Mr. Poller and it had nothing to do with the violation of the antitrust laws and that the purchased equipment is irrelevant to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.038" offset="927535">You will recall that Mr. Poller raises his claim on the fact that his station was worth $2 million and you will recall that he claims to have had a perspective purchaser in the form of a Mr. Storer who was willing to pay him the $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.612" offset="1009768">But, it is conceded that that offer or that proposal or that suggestion of $2 million included of course, the continued affiliation to CBS because Mr. Storer or any purchaser buying that station would want to have some kind of assurance that this affiliation would continue so that when we were being asked, or it was suggested or we had to contemplate the purchase of Mr. Poller's station for $2 million rather than purchasing Bartell's, we would be in effect buying back our own affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.781" offset="1186461">Although, under our contractual relationship with Mr. Poller, we had the absolute right to terminate within six months, so that in addition to paying six times as much as we would have to Bartell's, we would in effect be buying back our own affiliation from him when in fact, we have the right to cancel it on a six months notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.029" offset="1307460">The reason I say that the equipment purchase was irrelevant to his claim of injury was that if we have not voided, if we have merely continued with Bartell's, Mr. Poller would have been a half a million dollars poorer because we paid him that for his equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.134" offset="1407875">And if we hadn't paid it to him, he would have suffered substantially greater injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.645" offset="1441938">Now, there wasn't any inadequacy of equipment in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.605" offset="1465762">There's no claim here that there was any restraint in the business of television equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.383" offset="1496900">There wasn't anything unique about this equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.316" offset="1512678">As a matter of fact, on page 20 of the record, appears a statement in the complaint by Mr. Poller to the effect that we were in a position, CBS was in a position adequately to equip WOKY, that's Bartell's, and to transfer its programs to that station, so that it isn't even claimed that there's any restraint here with the respect to television station equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.839" offset="1658755">So that, it can have no effect at all upon the question as to whether the antitrust laws were violated.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.714" offset="1770245">And there can be no questions of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.831" offset="1778709">There was plenty of equipment at the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.457" offset="1789158">Hundreds of TV stations were being equipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.812" offset="1802637">There's no restraint at all in the question of equipment and this is wholly immaterial, not only to his injury but to the question as to whether the antitrust laws were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.270" offset="1852479">Now, after Mr. Storer had a cheque for a half-a-million dollars, after Mr. Poller had our cheque for a half-a-million dollars in his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.348" offset="1892812">He began to ruminate as to whether he had some cause of action against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.726" offset="1914232">And it took him18 months to find a cause of action or what he thinks as a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.433" offset="1941086">And after 18 months, he started this antitrust action against us, claiming damages, three-fold and damages were $2 million which he claimed was the value of the station, minus the $50,000 which he had received which was the value that he put upon the Bartell's equipment, and he multiplies that by three.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.061" offset="2099597">Plus $50,000 as the value the second-hand equipment and he multiplied the difference of a million 450 by three.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.299" offset="2144528">And this is the action which he decided to bring against us, 18 months after the close of this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.448" offset="2185174">And although his grievance is solely that we refused to deal with him and canceled his affiliation agreement, he has hung onto this claim, a mass of antitrust theories which it is our contention of which it is our contention, none can be sustained even assuming the facts that Mr. Poller recites as the basis of antitrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.229" offset="2312338">And we have to consider of course, was Section 2 violated, what Section 1 violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.266" offset="2340446">And turning to Section 2 and in all of this consideration taking the facts alleged by Mr. Poller to be true, the first thing we have to do to see whether Section 2 was violated, whether as Judge Whittaker asked, what is the relevant market here?</text>
            <text syncTime="578.654" offset="2417977">What market was monopolized?</text>
            <text syncTime="581.637" offset="2429889">And although in the course of this litigation on its way up to this bench, there have been changes in what the claimed relevant market is.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.622" offset="2477850">We have it fixed in this Court at least that the claim is that the relevant market which we monopolized was the UHF market in Milwaukee because he says there were formally two UHF stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.971" offset="2555277">And now, after we had bought Bartell's and Poller had quit broadcasting, there was only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.547" offset="2597595">Now, it seems quite clear that the very definition urged by Poller as to what the relevant market here is, defeats his very claim because it is a matter of which the court can take judicial notice, and it has been taking judicial notice of in many cases in the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.823" offset="2698637">At this UHF station of CBS's in Milwaukee, was competing first with two VHF stations and ultimately with three.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.189" offset="2768123">And if there is any validity to the test applied in the Cellophane and other cases to the effect that you must in a market consider competing goods readily acceptable substitutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.285" offset="2836564">It is quite clear that there cannot be the relevant market of UHF because in Milwaukee, and wherever there was a UHF station, UHF was competing and competing on very disadvantageous terms with VHF.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.504" offset="2925380">So that right in Milwaukee, persons who were listening to television had the choice of flipping their dial to look at two VHFs and later three VHFs or flipping the dial to the UHF station which CBS owned in Milwaukee, so that as a result, there was this intense competition between the one UHF station, which we were operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.864" offset="3070830">And the two and then three VHF stations which were operating two of them with a network affiliation and one independently, so that as a matter of law, the relevant market could not have been UHF in Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.152" offset="3171976">And if you try to find a relevant market in which it can reasonably be urged that CBS was a monopolist, such market cannot be found and in our brief, we discussed one after the other because wherever you go in the United States to look at television, you find intense competition among the three networks and in addition to the three networks, you'll find a number of independent television stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.883" offset="3322859">So that although, we may have in the United States a triopoly of the three networks in competition with each other, and in competition with independent television stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.436" offset="3381164">We do not have the situation which is contemplated in Section 2 of a monopoly in any market.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.420" offset="3421080">Take for example, the relevant market of all television, of all television in Milwaukee, obviously there was competition there.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.838" offset="3466742">Take the possible relevant market of television nationally, there was obviously fierce competition and there has been an always “will be” between the three networks.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.684" offset="3546154">The Federal Communications Commission is very sensitive about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.958" offset="3563186">And under the present set up of its regulations, I venture the opinion that it is impossible to get a monopoly the way the FCC runs a statute, a monopoly of any particular station, in any particular market in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.772" offset="3646464">And if we were a monopolist in Milwaukee, I repeat that we were the only monopolist in the history of the administration of the antitrust laws, which was forced out of business by its competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.125" offset="3707904">What kind of a monopolist is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="904.020" offset="3719502">Because, we had to give up the ghost after four years of operation to our competitors and to say that in spite of that, during these four years of struggle, we were a monopolist, seems to make a mockery of Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.429" offset="3801109">Now, turning to Section 1, the question of an unreasonable restrain, the contention there as I take it is, that there was a restraint and a restraint only in Milwaukee because of the reduction of the number of stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.069" offset="3895672">We have urged and the court below has found that there was no restraint and that this what happened in Milwaukee was only an extension or perhaps a repetition of what has happened in so many areas in which the rule of United States against Colgate has been applied to the effect and in the absence of any horizontal arrangements or conspiracies with others or concerted the refusals to sell such as in the Times-Picayune case or Parke-Davis case and in the absence of those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.499" offset="4093367">Every man has the right to pick the customers with whom he will do business, and this has been perhaps typified most strongly in the automobile cases in which automobile manufacturers picked an exclusive agent in certain territories to sell their own cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.590" offset="4213739">And it has been held time again and those cases have come to this Court and it has been held time and again that although there is a great disparity of bargaining power between General Motors for example and its exclusive dealers, that although there is this great disparity of power, that is not tantamount to a violation of the antitrust laws and that there is no unreasonable restraint involved if a dealership is terminated within the meaning of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.189" offset="4384162">And the Congress agrees of course with this because Your Honors will recall that when complaints were filed with the Congress, with the respect to the sometimes cruel methods which automobile manufacturers used with their dealers, and when it was firmly established as a principle of law, that no remedy could be found pursuant to the antitrust laws that the Congress passed the statute known as the “Dealer's Day in Court Act” under which, the dealers were given some protection from the superior bargaining power of the manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.698" offset="4574124">But, the point is that that action was taken by Congress as it said to supplement the antitrust laws because the antitrust laws did not cover that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.768" offset="4630444">Now, the Colgate rule has been applied to broadcast in a case which came up from the Circuit Court and in which certiorari was denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.100" offset="4691780">It was held in Federal Broadcasting against ABC, that the rule that a man can deal with the customer that he picks can be applied to the selection of an affiliate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.580" offset="4749667">And this is quite natural because in many ways, the affiliation contract is very similar to the dealer cases because what CBS does when it comes for example to WTOP here in Washington is to say, “We would like to present our programs through you, and we will pay you a certain amount per hour if you will present our programs in your locality and it does that with some 200 stations through the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.784" offset="4922493">Now, what happened here was that although, we had that affiliation with Mr. Poller that we had the right under the Colgate rule without violating Section 1 to say to Mr. Poller, “We have decided to terminate your agreement which was our right on the contract and to make a new affiliation agreement with someone else or to buy a station.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.343" offset="5044746">And so far as the antitrust laws are concerned, it made no difference to Poller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.997" offset="5067316">There was no greater impact upon Poller whether we merely switched his affiliation or whether we terminated his affiliation and bought a station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.007" offset="5119352">So that the restraint which is alleged here namely that in some way CBS was responsible for reducing the number of stations in Milwaukee cannot be sustained and is refuted by Mr. Poller's allegations himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.459" offset="5209213">I read to Your Honors yesterday from his complaint in which he said that an unaffiliated UHF station could not survive in a mixed market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.347" offset="5256756">This was the basis of his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.237" offset="5268355">And we accept that for purposes -- certainly for purposes of summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.292" offset="5292492">We accept that and we say that therefore the fact that the number of markets, the number of outlets, the number of UHF stations in Milwaukee rather was reduced from two to one, was a matter of inevitability according to his own allegations.</text>
