            <text syncTime="16.680" offset="171112">Your Honor, on reargument, if I may, I think that it would be helpful for the Court to have a full statement of the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.030" offset="244464">The one statute which is before the Court which we allege and contend is unconstitutional, was a Virginia statute which was enacted with the extra session in 1956 and which statute amended the Virginia bars to running and capping to include the -- an organization which retained an attorney or compensated an attorney in -- or attorneys in matters in which he’d have no pecuniary right or liability and which also made it a crime for organizations to solicit business for attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.669" offset="431083">The statute subjected the attorneys who were involved to disbarment and made the activities on the part of the organization a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.300" offset="477581">On the theory that this statute was a part of a package of anti NAACP laws and was in fact aimed at the petitioner and designed to run the petitioner out of business and in fact to a part of the Virginia’s massive resistance plan to school -- to school desegregation, we brought proceedings in the federal court, attacking this statute and four others.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.050" offset="592624">As the Court knows, three of these statutes were construed by the federal court in NAACP versus Patty.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.781" offset="619478">Appeal was brought to this Court and this -- the judgment below was set aside on the application of the doctrine of federal abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.083" offset="652706">I might add that since that time, those statutes had been in the Virginia state courts and they have -- a decision by the City Court of Richmond has struck those statutes down.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.080" offset="712683">Two of the statutes, one of which is presently here was declared by the federal court in NAACP versus Patty to be too obscure for authoritative construction and understanding.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.967" offset="1292288">It's composed of approximately 80 or 89 branches of the national organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.941" offset="1316112">These are unincorporated Associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.629" offset="1338890">There are groups -- with the -- a group of lawyers at the time of this proceeding and numbered 15, they called themselves “legal staff” a legal committee of the Virginia State Conference.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.755" offset="1515374">These group of lawyers have been working together and they are the persons that will panel litigation which the NAACP brings in the Court or sponsors in the Court or pays for which are brought in the Court on a matter of which there is a concern about the issue of racial discrimination, school segregation and that cases -- and cases as they come.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.284" offset="1797496">It is also active in cases, in criminal cases in which the Negro defendant is involved in which by virtue of a -- of what we believe to be a denial of due process, the administration of justice has -- there has been a failure of the administration's suggestion of justice and we think that this kind of case would be helpful to Negroes in order to secure a higher standard justice, an even handed justice is applied to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.851" offset="1915779">So that the only basis in which the Association takes the case, it is that, it's whether or not its belief that the resolution of the issue will have some effects on Negroes as a client.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.148" offset="2908954">However, as you well know when the initial school desegregation, the matter was brought -- it required a considerable amount of -- larger amount sum of money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.948" offset="4448193">It should also be remembered that in this effort, the Negro as a class is arrayed against the whole panoply of state power and that the Association in the effort to encourage Negroes to assert their rights in an effort to find a way -- ways and means of having these rights adjudicated so that they can be [Inaudible], is in fact, it is -- it has to come almost -- the NAACP and the Negroes in terms of their rights are arrayed against the state government and that most of these actions and the fact of the matter was the action that's involved in this record which is before the Court, is an action involving the reach of state power whether or not the various acts are discriminatory or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2689.727" offset="10863344">The Association, and this is particularly -- will be particularly illuminated in the -- on the issue of the criminal cases, when the Association supports an individual who says that he has been convicted by coerce confession or the exclusion of Negroes in the jury, the Association would -- and its lawyers would underwrite this case and bring the case up if necessary to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.192" offset="10993121">If at a -- at some point, and this has occurred, where the Court would decide on some other basis that this person would get a life sentence or some judgment that would be binding on him until his benefit and he has no interest in further prosecuting this constitutional question, the NAACP naturally adheres or the lawyer handling the case would adhere to his wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.556" offset="11094580">Now, in the -- in the -- this is where it's -- and when you get to the question of school segregation, what the -- what the respondents are saying is, that because the NAACP says that we will not sponsor litigation unless it involves an attach on segregation per se that this in itself is controlling on the grounds that some Negroes who might be on the South would be happy inside this [Inaudible] argued separate with equal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.190" offset="11225192">But all I'm saying, Mr. Justice White, is that we make that decision before we entered the litigation and after that, the issue as to whether or not the particular litigant is going to pursue the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5076.035" offset="20408487">And I say to this Court if you read this record as a whole, it is clear that the petitioner has violated Section 54-78 of the Code of Virginia either prior to or after the amendment or has violated the Canons of ethics as the court below has held and that certain attorneys or certain records, certain evidence in the record, indicate that certain attorneys have violated Section 54-74 of the Code of Virginia prior to the amendment or after the amendment or with no statute on the Canons of ethics and it seems to me in conclusion that for this Court to reverse the Court of Appeals of Virginia, it must reverse -- in effect reverse many State Court decisions not only in Virginia but in other states which had been cited in the respondents brief and also by the Court of Appeals and hold that solicitation as shown by this record is not proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.090" offset="20688729">If it does do that, this Court on the other alternative, it seems to me, would be to say that when Negroes are urging their constitutional rights, the Canons of legal ethics in section -- statutes such as Section 54-74, do not have to be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.204" offset="20765215">We have an exception in that type of case or we can just simply say that the petitioner may have its own set of rules and the rest of us will continue under the old set of rules.</text>
