            <text syncTime="22.741" offset="194330">The questions involved in this case set forth at pages 6 and 7 of the petitioner's brief and the first question is this, Were the petitioner, in this case, a prominent labor union official, has been subjected to continuous, prolonged, and sustained, extensive, enhancive and adverse publicity in all media of communication throughout the judicial area in which he lives and is tried, must the state provide him in his grand jury proceeding where the grand jury which is a fair and unbiased and impartial grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.770" offset="410415">And this question arises in the State of Washington under circumstances under which accusation may be made by information as well as by indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.956" offset="463182">The second question is, does the petitioner have a right to have the grand jury charged in a fair and impartial manner and in a manner which is not inflammatory and which is -- does not invite the jury's attention, the grand jury's attention to adverse, extremely adverse publicity of a hostile nature which has been circulated about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.335" offset="572688">Third question relates to the conduct of prosecutors in the grand jury room with respect to witnesses who are testifying and have testified in favor of or in a manner favorably to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.780" offset="662444">The next two questions relate to failure of the state and the courts of the state to grant a motion for a continuance, the motion for change of venue under these circumstances where there has been this tremendous campaign of vilification, adverse publicity about the defendant, the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.550" offset="785533">Our position of course is that the state under these circumstances must provide a defendant with a fair grand jury, a fair method of accusation and that the state must do so both under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.507" offset="1309445">The unfair grand jury proceedings were carried over into the trial and infected the trial, infected the conduct of the trial, because the grand jury proceedings were used to impeach witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.778" offset="1370467">The grand jury proceedings were mentioned in the course of the closing argument by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.134" offset="1395858">The prosecutor, for example, referring to the grand jury proceedings and the grand jury in the indictment said something to the effect that these grand jurors were not the 17 ogres.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.801" offset="1438595">They were just ordinary people like you and me.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.429" offset="1453119">The grand -- one of the prosecutors or Mayor of Seattle who is a special prosecutor in the grand jury proceedings testified concerning statements made by the petitioner to the grand jury when he appeared before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.271" offset="1536502">And although he testified to certain admissions or statements made by the petitioner in the grand jury when we attempted to obtain the entire grand jury testimony or transcript of the petitioner's testimony in the grand jury, he denied that the court examine the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.968" offset="1611212">Decided that while only this portion related to the witnesses' testimony and we only were given that portion which the trial court thought related to the witnesses' testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1452.143" offset="5911907">Now, four of the judges, the case was heard before eight judges, one judge disqualified himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.449" offset="5949210">Four of those judges thought that the conviction should be affirmed on every point and one of the judges wrote an opinion for all of them covering every point saying that the entire thing should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.442" offset="6009187">And four other judges said that it should not be affirmed because of the fact that the defendant was entitled for a fair grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.470" offset="6073240">But the judges rewrote the opinion from the four -- in favor of affirmance did discuss this question of change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.674" offset="6110020">And his distinction of the Hillman case which had held that a motion for a change of venue based upon an uncontradicted affidavit gives you a right in one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.502" offset="6157354">His distinction in that case was that -- well, in your case counsel, meaning this case, that the -- your statements in this affidavit are nothing more than conclusions and the Hillman case doesn't apply if the -- if the statements are nothing more than conclusions, well, it doesn't hid -- it of course doesn't seem to me that they are conclusions where I put in questions about the number of television stations and the circulation of newspapers and things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.394" offset="6296952">In addition, I have included in this affidavit a provision which says that jury panels in King County where we tried this case invariably include employees of the Boeing Airplane Company and that a few years previous to this, there was a most bitter jurisdictional dispute between the Teamsters of which the petitioner was the president and the Aeromechanics Union concerning the right of representation and I averted here that that dispute resulted in an attitude of hostility and bitterness between the two unions and the officers of the two unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.710" offset="6466226">As it turned out, I wound up with, I believe, two Boeing employee jurors, one of whom was the foreman.</text>

            <text syncTime="2658.144" offset="10735992">Now, Justice Harlan, in resisting the petition for certiorari, the state as I recall said something to this effect, The Supreme Court of the State of Washington can decide what their law is and they said that because the State of Washington can't decide what its law was, this Court couldn't take certiorari and that the only remedy was to do some -- for the legislature to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.164" offset="10860022">You see our -- so I guess they were suggesting that the petitioner go to jail while the legislature makes up its mind what is the law on the State of Washington is but of course that can't be the answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2740.563" offset="11065657">In their first decision, they had a per curiam besides these two 4-to-4 decisions, they had a per curiam decision which said something of this -- it said this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3528.095" offset="14215711">Yes he could and the important point in that connection is this, it seems to me that in the first place the mere -- of course generally speaking, the mere fact that one can return an information is not any reason for granting or for refusing to dismiss again for an indictment where there have been improper grand jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.447" offset="14301184">We have never -- let's say the antitrust laws which can be -- if you were -- accusation will be made for client information where a -- there has been an unauthorized person in the grand jury room or the wrong grand jury considers the matter of something of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.839" offset="14362728">It never occurred to anyone to say that -- well, they could proceed by information anyway so we will not pay any attention to this error in connection with the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.216" offset="14396270">But here where a witness has been treated in this manner I believe this indicates that there is all the more reason for seeing to it that the grand jury proceedings must be handled correctly because here is what the prosecutor could -- can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.200" offset="14472129">He can call a grand jury proceeding and he can get this wit -- the possible defense witnesses in there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3599.933" offset="14503058">He can create a free trial impeachment program for himself then dismiss the whole thing and then turn around and file information which I think is quite improper and not the function of the grand jury at all.</text>
