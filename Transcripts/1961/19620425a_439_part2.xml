            <label>Mr. John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="132.917" offset="638140">Your Honor, as I try to point out when I describe the discounts schedules, practically every store we serve gets a different price so that we have the -- we run the risk by doing that on being put to the test of comparing any two stores we serve because practically everybody pays a different price with this continuous sliding scale discount so that we feel we have this burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.677" offset="721105">Whenever the differentials are put forward as to our system, we will have to justify the particular differentials that are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.533" offset="748586">I don't mean to say that if out of two or 3000 stores and we went to the task of trying to justify all 3000, we justified 2900 and fail to justify on100, that that would mean the whole system should fail, I think there has to be some area reasonableness but it seems to me Your Honor, that the Government or the plaintiff should have the burden of picking examples which would put us to the fair cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.846" offset="853807">If they want to predicate their case on the assumption that somewhere in the population of stores which we serve, there is an independent store who is identical to a chain store in the volume which he purchases and in the methods of delivery to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.931" offset="914202">There's no great problem in there identifying that store and putting in evidence pertaining to that store.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.896" offset="1002078">Number two, I would suppose that when the Government shows that there have been price differentials made within the classification, that you will have to show that the whole classification was just -- with that regard to those particular eight to ten stores.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.231" offset="1095387">Perhaps I should address myself to them right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.349" offset="1107822">They suggest that the classification which we have made is chains versus independents.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.089" offset="1130809">Now, it's true that in the prima facie case they took some examples of independents and examples of chains and there's frequent talk about the chain stores under one hand and the independents on the other, it's throughout the study, but that is not the principle of classification which is laid down in the cost study and may I direct Your Honor's attention to page 200 and -- I believe it's 78 -- no, 84 of the record which is the basic description of the Bowman Costing System in which the expert suggest in comparing the two classes at various volume levels --</text>

            <text syncTime="320.308" offset="1387645">Your Honor, the margin -- I should pause to explain this for just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.872" offset="1409902">The margin is the margin available to the dairy after all of its costs have been incurred in performing the service and paying for the milk and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.328" offset="1447727">There's a margin left out of which it pays its overhead, its taxes and derives a profit and the study shows that if the margin available on one transaction is equal to the margin available on the other then the cost would be -- necessarily be equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.378" offset="1511988">So this -- this phrase here is sort of stated in reverse -- it's a -- but the margin refers to the profit margin I might say although that's not entirely accurate, so that you calculate the margin for the independent or anyone else receiving the extensive delivery services and this is done at each volume level and I must stress, that it is not an accurate statement that Bowman relies only on a difference in method of delivery that the method and the volume are -- always work together.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.647" offset="1629017">The method -- there are separate cost course and affect which take into the account the volume differentials and also the method differentials; but you calculate for an independent store any other group will be receiving equally extensive delivery services and that goes on in a chain store or any other group receiving equally limited delivery services and certainly that contemplates that if another store was -- did not take the more expensive form of delivery, that it should be -- the costing would be the same as per chain and it would follow the price should be the same so that --</text>

            <text syncTime="417.486" offset="1776347">That's -- well, the procedure which is set up Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.052" offset="1790663">We don't say that the law requires store-by-store classification -- store-by-store justification, but if a specific case is -- a specific differential is called to our attention and said, you must justify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.964" offset="1846251">It would seem that a sufficient justification would have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.399" offset="1860044">If you have showed that comparing the cost as between those two stores, you can justify the price differential and it is true this procedure makes it possible to calculate on a store-by-store basis and that is exactly what our cost study did.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.124" offset="1926917">It was not based on an average of everyone in the group but rather the cost for the particular stores depending on his particular volume and the particular method of delivering to that store; so that it is -- the procedure does permit this kind of defense of because we followed that I don't think that raises the legal question of whether we had to be that detailed but we thought we had gone just as far we could possibly be required to go in defense of the price differentials which were identified by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.265" offset="2187515">If you think that because you could show that particular stores the Government have to pick out after make up its prima facie case of discrimination or differential in sales because you haven't been able to prove that that particular store that man was not as efficient would justify your classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.903" offset="2262016">Well, Your Honor I'll try and answer that question as directly as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.472" offset="2280302">First, let me perhaps correct one thought that I see in the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.628" offset="2300991">It isn't a question of the efficiency of the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.495" offset="2312380">It's a question of whether the seller derives efficiency in his own operation by means of the method of delivery to the store and perhaps I should identify where in this cost-saving lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.086" offset="2362744">The customer services it is true, include different elements but with respect to the large doors and all of the large stores the evidence shows took the customer services.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.860" offset="2405898">What we're talking about is the function of taking the milk from the back delivery platform and placing it into the showcases in the interior of the store and rearranging it for sale the next day where they put the milk which is left over from the last state of the front of the case so that'll be sold first and adjust the merchandise taking anywhere from 15, 20, 25 minutes in a large supermarket for the milkman to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.140" offset="2502969">If he does it or if the milk driver doesn't do it, then the storekeeper has to employ his own personnel to perform the work because the work must be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.119" offset="2538914">It's that he can't just dump the milk off.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.495" offset="2548423">Now, there is quite obviously a substantial difference in the time required to make the delivery if the milkman goes in and does this work in the one case or in the other case if the storeowner says, "No, you stay out of my store.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.779" offset="2609549">I don't want you parading up and down the aisles and I want to keep the aisles free for the customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.996" offset="2626476">I want it do have that done by my own personnel and I'll absorb that cost to my own operation."</text>
            <text syncTime="634.913" offset="2646120">So, the cost and of course the difference in the time he's taking to do it affect the costs to delivery per unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.144" offset="2791048">The independent knows whether he's putting a milk away himself or whether the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.606" offset="2808916">If he uses the less costly method and there is no other cost saving factor present and our study doesn't rely on any others except differences in volume and this point and the relatively minor point of cash collection which is very -- very trivial importance in the large stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.875" offset="2877983">If he uses the same method as the chains and buys in the same value -- volume under our study, he's entitled of the same price.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.449" offset="2908285">Now, I can't give a legal opinion on whether every independent would always be entitled to it because some other dairy might have other cost savings that we don't rely upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.855" offset="7681902">After during which period it was the most thorough analysis of all of the premises on which our study was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.462" offset="7708338">The particular stores which were selected for as representatives for testing purposes in fact took the customer services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.137" offset="7734983">I don't understand there to be any dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.487" offset="7748357">The volume differentials along with the difference in method of delivery fully justified the cause -- the price differentials which are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.647" offset="7781063">The rebuttal exhibit which is now the foundation of the entire government argument, as I say, related to a different issue the question of the percentage of use of glass versus percentage uses of fiber, glass being more expensive to handle because you have to pick up the empty bottles and chain stores use relatively less glass than the independents was shown by their own exhibits which they put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.061" offset="7874685">That rebuttal exhibit is not confined to the Chicago area, so the large stores identified or referred to in that exhibit are not shown to have paid a different price than the chain stores did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.817" offset="7925676">The classification on which Bowman predicated its entire cost study drew a distinction between chains on the one hand or included in that proof, any other stores receiving limited services and independents or any stores receiving equally extensive delivery services, and if we assume that Bowman would follow the advice of its cost experts which they did when the put into effect these all discount structure, presumably, they would have followed that advice and permitted access to either class as the particularly cost dictated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.309" offset="8067678">I respectfully submit that the Bowman cost defense is sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.846" offset="8093800">I think I can be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.169" offset="8103100">I don't want to relitigate this question of whether we were trying to show a price discrimination with respect to a system or nine stores, I think it's perfectly clear that we were showing a discriminatory system based on the entire discount schedule which Bowman had generally applicable throughout Chicago in which nobody has suggested throughout the entire argument below or here was ever deviated from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.160" offset="8231100">Nobody suggests that any independent store ever got more than the maximum of 8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.017" offset="8258476">There's no suggestion of any deviation and it's perfectly clear that what this case was about as Judge Campbell recognized, was whether this system could be cost justified or whether it could be cost justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.601" offset="8324827">More than that as I pointed out before on his alleged proof about this nine stores as I read you from page 330 when you looked on how they proved that, that again was based on these assumptions as to this customer services etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.438" offset="8392223">Basically, as far as we can see, this case is a very simple one and illustrates very well --</text>

            <text syncTime="2096.306" offset="8491698">As I read what they say, they make it perfectly clear with respect to this study of these nine stores that they were again based on assumptions and we're not doing it on any basis of any study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.546" offset="8544674">I read this to the Court before, I can only say read the last paragraph on page 329 and the top two paragraphs on page 330 and then of course it's not a question who -- what Mr. Stevens or I think, is what Your Honor thinks.</text>

            <text syncTime="2127.261" offset="8615518">Basically, this case is I think very simple one and particularly simple with respect to the problems that Justice Douglas mentioned before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.308" offset="8655642">We have the start of a very reasonable system by moment I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.863" offset="8673928">It was counsel for Bowman that there are methods of discounts up to the limit they cut off that for the independent stores is a very reasonable one, very fair and equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.931" offset="8726173">All we have to do -- to do -- make this a fair system, the type of system much can be applied in the future defendant, irrespective of where the actual figures are, are three things one, don't cut it off, let it continue on to its natural resting place depending on what the stores actually take in volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.340" offset="8815825">Two, if there's a differential as there undoubtedly is for in store services, say that the price to stores taking in stores services will be this much more than the stores, then don't take this in store services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.601" offset="8884893">And three, if there's a difference admittedly a small difference with respect to cash customers as against credit customers, charge the cash customers more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.969" offset="8930346">To simple as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.212" offset="8939332">If you set up your discount on a rational basis which is open to everybody who wishes to qualify for it and can, you don't have to worry about any classification problem and cost justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.928" offset="8990114">You don't have to worry Justice Black about the details of whether you can do this on an individual basis or a general basis because the whole problem won't arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.252" offset="9027417">The difficulties here, the inherent difficulties here are not that Bowman has got a false classification as a cost justification, that I suggest is unnecessary consequence of the fact that their discount system was a false discount system and that can be simply taken cared off.</text>
