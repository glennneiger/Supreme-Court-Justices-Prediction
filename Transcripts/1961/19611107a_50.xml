            <text syncTime="20.609" offset="185762">This action is here on writ of certiorari to review a money judgment of a state court against the petitioning union and in favor of the employer, respondent here for damages -- based on damages caused by a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.494" offset="269354">The respondent, a flour broker, had a union shop agreement with the union which provided in part, the employer reserves the right to discharge any man in his employ if his work is not satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.615" offset="357857">This action had its origin on the morning of May 12, 1958 when an elderly employee, Jack Welch, drove a forklift truck off of the loading dock of the company, dropped some five feet, injured the forklift truck and injured himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.061" offset="455659">He went home for 10 or 12 days under doctor's care, received a -- a week's accumulated vacation pay and when he received his vacation check (Inaudible) so he picked it up, there was a note with it, which Your Honors will find on -- in the record on page 219, memo from Nick Lucas.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.793" offset="1034533">And on May 27, they sent down -- in the morning, sent down a business agent with Welch to see if they could square things away.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.877" offset="1458866">After hearings and five months after the strike had ended, the Arbitration Board came out with findings that Welch's services had been unsatisfactory for some years and this was the climax of unsatisfactory service.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.290" offset="3344488">From this tort judgment, we appealed and the State Supreme Court affirmed the judgment on a dual basis, on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.186" offset="3392136">One in tort that the strike was an attempt to force the employer to forego his exercise of -- the exercise of his right to discharge Welch for unsatisfactory service, and as to that, we of course raise the point as to the tort action, the state courts were preempted by the jurisdiction of the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.420" offset="3521076">As to that, they said preemption was no problem because this was neither a protected activity to strike; it was neither a protected activity nor a prohibited activity under the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.467" offset="3581262">The second ground was that this was a common law breach of contract as to Section 301 despite the fact that we cited the Linc -- this Court's decision in Lincoln Mills case.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.918" offset="3643016">They said that Section 301 was obviously purely a jurisdictional provision and did not affect the substantive law involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.882" offset="3694947">And therefore, they were free to apply local common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.521" offset="3729429">Now unless this Court wishes otherwise, I'm not -- I do not intend to spend much time on the tort aspect of the supporting opinion of the court below because I deal with this -- it's so obvious that this falls within the San Diego Build -- Building Trades against Garmon as at least an arguably protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.110" offset="3859832">And therefore, the initial jurisdiction play in the Labor Board to determine whether the terms of this contract waived the protection of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.812" offset="3922631">The more novel question is the common law breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.311" offset="3948648">As I say, the opinion of the court below says that -- said that 30 -- Section 301 of the Act did not affect the substantive law and therefore they are free to apply local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.769" offset="4010402">We do not contend that the Lincoln Mills decision specifically decided that Section 301 supplanted inconsistent local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.958" offset="4067244">We do submit that it almost necessarily follows from this Court's decision in Lincoln Mills case because if you have in this case two inconsistent laws governing the same contract and potentially 51 inconsistent laws governing a national labor contract, it would result in chaos.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.060" offset="4191587">Perhaps a stronger argument for this proposition lies in the fact that if a matter, say a strike or any form of labor activity is not forbidden under that contract by Section 301 applied to the labor contract, then it could be, in many cases would be, a protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.398" offset="4344978">And if the state law said that this would be penalized by money judgment or by an injunction, this would be a clash of jurisdictions between state and federal and of course federal should prevail.</text>
