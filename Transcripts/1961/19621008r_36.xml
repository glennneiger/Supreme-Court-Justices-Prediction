            <text syncTime="37.994" offset="255352">On June 4 of 1959, in the City of San Francisco, federal narcotics agents arrested one Hom Way at 2 a.m. in the morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="78.944" offset="419192">He stated that he had obtained the heroin, which was found in his possession, from a man named “Blackie Toy” who operated a laundry on Leavenworth Street in the City of San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.753" offset="494425">Federal narcotics agents then left narcotics headquarters accompanied by local police, they were altogether seven in number.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.084" offset="1807757">Yee was then taken to federal narcotics headquarters and Yee was interrogated by narcotics agents with respect to his source of supply whereupon Yee stated, “I received this heroin from James Wah Toy and from a man known to me only as “Sea Dog.”</text>
            <text syncTime="451.763" offset="1910471">The agents then went back to petitioner James Wah Toy and they asked him if he knew anyone known as “Sea Dog” and he said, “Yes, I know a man named Wong Sun,” who is referred to as “Sea Dog” whereupon he led the officers to the residence of Wong Sun on Franklin Street in the City of San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.617" offset="2001795">The agents entered Wong Sun's house went upstairs to his bedroom where has was sleeping, he was placed under arrest, a systematic search was made at his dwelling house and no contraband was found.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.081" offset="2227702">Because of the fact that the Government made a statement in its brief wholly without record foundation that an arraignment had been made, when we were appointed in this case, we undertook to find out if there had been an arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.374" offset="2288828">And if the Court will recall at the end of the argument last April, we were asked to submit such documents as we had been able to recover which reflected the arraignment of Toy and Sun, and those were presented to the Court and I will have reference to them later on in my discussion of the evidentiary question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.759" offset="2390392">Sufficed to say at this time that statements were made by petitioner Wong Sun and by petitioner Wah Toy, they were transcribed by narcotics agents and they were presented to the petitioners for signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.201" offset="2460191">The petitioners refused to sign the statements, but ultimately, they became evidence at the trial, offered orally by the agents who took them.</text>

            <text syncTime="630.281" offset="2624449">Now, the petitioners were indicted for violation of Title 21 Section 174 of the United States Code which is that section which makes it a felony to conceal, to transport, to facilitate transportation, to buy or sell narcotics knowing them to have been illegally imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.027" offset="2707519">They were indicted in the first count for a conspiracy to commit this offense, Toy and Sun, and in the second count for the substantive offense itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.087" offset="2743672">The case came on for trial and it was the intention of the prosecutor to prove his case by calling the witness Yee and using the viva voce testimony of Yee.</text>

            <text syncTime="673.582" offset="2797693">Yee took the stand and Yee proved to be a recalcitrant witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.516" offset="2905422">He was then excused from the stand and so it was necessary for the prosecutor to take a different tack to make a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.006" offset="2935411">He then undertook to make a prima facie case this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.288" offset="2948472">He showed the fact of the arrest of petitioner Toy.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.503" offset="2965400">He showed the statement made on the threshold of that arrest namely that narcotics could be found in Yee's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.499" offset="2997373">He then showed the arrest of Yee and the recovery of the narcotics in Yee's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.006" offset="3019421">He placed those narcotics physically in evidence and offered two statements made subsequently by the then defendants now petitioners which were offered as incriminating admissions and he rested.</text>

            <text syncTime="778.184" offset="3216071">With respect to petitioner Sun, Sun conceded that he had transported narcotics to Yee and had sold narcotics to Yee and that after the sale was consummated on each of several occasions that they had participated in a friendly smoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.978" offset="3303320">Now, with respect to the finding by the trial judge, he indicated that it was his disposition first of all to find the defendants guilty of the conspiracy count and not guilty of the substantive count but because the prosecutor represented, he would be more sanguine for purposes of appeal if the converse were done, the judge obliged -- obliged and he found them guilty of the substantive offense and not guilty of the conspiracy offense and ultimately that case was taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and that Court unanimously found that both arrests were effected unlawfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.270" offset="3484400">But two of the judges refused to attach any evidentiary consequences to the illegal arrest and so the convictions were affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.015" offset="3515434">And it's in that posture that the case is before this Court this morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.776" offset="3682513">Now, it is our contention that the arrests of both petitioners were unlawfully effected.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.822" offset="3714696">There is no finding by either lower court that the arrests were lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.246" offset="3736325">Even the trial judge avoided that finding because you can search the record and you find no rationale for his admission of the contested evidence into the record at no point does he say the arrest were lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.579" offset="3801736">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found unanimously that the arrests were unlawfully affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.304" offset="3828590">Now, the Government seeks to go behind those findings and have the arrest validated by this Court so that the evidentiary question may be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.683" offset="3874147">Now, with respect to the arrest, the Government does not contend or indeed couldn't contend reasonably that on the mere statement of Hom Way federal agents had the right to go place petitioner Toy under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.745" offset="3938304">The record is very clear that Hom Way was an untested informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.037" offset="3955545">He had never before given information to federal narcotics agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.177" offset="3972054">He made a statement when he was in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.827" offset="3982712">And the Government does not allege that this constituted a probable cause for arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.757" offset="4010402">What does the Government say?</text>
            <text syncTime="978.557" offset="4017612">The Government contends that probable cause arose when Alton Wong went to the door of Oye's Laundry, knocked on the door and when the occupant of those premises fled through the laundry back to his living quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.539" offset="4105488">That contends the Government provided the indispensable link to making probable cause for an unlawful arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1047.659" offset="4293987">Now, I think it's necessary to look at this episode in its proper frame of reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.024" offset="4319483">First of all, at the time that the agents went to Leavenworth Street, they had no reason to believe that the laundry, which Alton Wong approached, was the laundry referred to by Hom Way, it was a different name, it was Oye's laundry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.827" offset="4398686">Hom Way had not given the address.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.113" offset="4407777">Leavenworth Street is one of the longest streets in San Francisco, presumably, insofar as this record is concerned, those agents were engaged in a systematic investigation of Chinese laundries on Leavenworth Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.691" offset="4462111">And so when they knocked at the door and the occupant came, there was no reason to believe that the man who opened that door was the ‘Blackie Toy' referred to by Hom Way and they didn't ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.881" offset="4510908">Alton Wong didn't asked are you -- are you ‘Blackie Toy' or are you Mr. Toy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.892" offset="4534941">Instead of that, not knowing that he was at the premises referred to by his untested informant, not knowing that the occupant who answered the door was the ‘Blackie Toy' who was referred to by his untested informant, he undertaken -- undertook immediately to perpetrate a ruse on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.896" offset="4602964">And instead of saying, “Are you Blackie Toy?</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.175" offset="8200025">Again, this Court for almost a half a century has attached an evidentiary consequence to a violation of the Fourth Amendment beginning in the Weeks case that held that any physical evidence obtained as a result of a violation of the Fourth Amendment should be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.741" offset="8274317">Now, the federal exclusionary rule has for its purpose the deterrence of the lawless law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.013" offset="8311411">I suggest to the Court that so long as any derivative benefits or fruits are allowed to law enforcement officers for lawless conduct, that the federal exclusionary rule cannot be expected to work because there will be no -- there will be no reason for compliance because no other sanctions are ever imposed with respect to violations of Fourth Amendment rights of the citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.763" offset="8414438">And I suggest that if in fact the federal police as a result of an illegal arrest may get threshold statements from the accused which can be admissible in the federal proceeding, later on a criminal proceeding, there'll be no reason not to continue unlawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.620" offset="8509837">The Court has been consistent in striking down physical evidence obtained as a result of a Fourth Amendment violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.610" offset="9357772">That where a statement is made during a period of illegal detention and that case as a result of a violation of Rule 5 prolonged detention without taking the accused before a magistrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2336.988" offset="9451290">Now, I think consistency demands that where you have the violation of a constitutional right namely a violation of the Fourth Amendment, you had illegal detention ab initio because the very fact of the arrest shows that the detention from the beginning was unlawful that a statement made during that unlawful detention should be struck down as being inadmissible especially in the light of the fact that this particular statement was made right on the threshold of the arrest when the coercive influences of an unlawful arrest certainly cannot be regarded as having been broken and there was no demonstration by the Government or attempt to demonstrate by the Government that the coercive influence of an unlawful arrest consummated at 6:30 a.m. in the morning at pistol point with handcuffs in the bedroom of a man where his wife and child were present did not have a coercive influence on his statement or his subsequent expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="2946.850" offset="11890813">Now, with respect to the statements that were offered, it's been axiomatic in our jurisprudence that an uncorroborated confession cannot support a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.707" offset="11950164">Likewise, axiomatic that in any criminal case all of the elements that the offense must be proven and they must be proven by extrinsic evidence of by corroborated admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.203" offset="12000214">Now, in this particular case assuming arguendo that all of the evidence was admissible, there is still no corroboration in this case of possession by either Wong Sun or by petitioner Wah Toy apart from their own statements in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.356" offset="12080776">Now, possession becomes the heart of this case because it is on de facto position that the statute creates a presumption and possessions unexplained that there was transportation, sale, concealment and purchase and if there is no possession, there is no basis for inference or presumption that any of these elements of the offense were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.106" offset="12171786">Now, with respect to petitioner Toy, there is not only no independent evidence of the fact that he ever possessed a narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.358" offset="12216822">In fact, the confession doesn't concede possession of a narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.428" offset="12233122">The confession simply concedes a transportation of Wong Sun to the home of Johnny Yee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.291" offset="12260498">In the case of Wong Sun, there is no independent evidence in this whole record to support an admission of possession of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.089" offset="12303757">The possession was found in Johnny Yee, the presumption that is created by statute authorizing the inference of the other elements of the offense, works against Johnny Yee certainly but there cannot be such an inference or a presumption made against either petitioner James Wah Toy or petitioner Wong Sun because there is no evidence apart from their own statements in the manner that they ever possessed and accordingly, that they ever transported, that they ever concealed, that they ever sold, that they ever purchased, and a fortiori that they had any knowledge of illegal importation of the heroin in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3136.643" offset="12649932">For all the drama of this case some of it quite real, some of it less clearly so, it is easy to lose sight of the precise questions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.473" offset="12693295">Petitioners' primary contentions are two in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.993" offset="12707297">First, that most of the evidence on which the Government's conviction rested was attained as a result of one or more unlawful arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.098" offset="12743764">Secondly, that the detailed confessions of the two defendants were not sufficiently corroborated by outside evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.104" offset="12771767">Now, the first of these points relates to a course of events that can be very briefly summarized in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.654" offset="12797994">First, petitioner Toy was arrested, illegally, as the petitioners contend and at that time made a statement implicating one Yee, then Yee was arrested surrendered a quantity of narcotics and made a statement implicating Wong Sun, then Wong Sun was arrested again illegally according to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.000" offset="12875421">And then subsequently after arraignment both Yee -- both he and Toy made the confession that I've heard --</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.675" offset="12946056">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.410" offset="12948982">That is very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.303" offset="12952534">I may go into this in a more detail and I'll certainly cover that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.001" offset="12967372">But Toy statement implicating Yee and the Narcotics surrendered by Yee and then the admissions or the confessions of Toy and Wong Sun after arraignment were all admitted into evidence and in each instance over the objections of petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.829" offset="13038738">So petitioner's first point raises two questions; first, whether the arrests of petitioners were lawful and if not whether the evidence to which petitioners objected or was the product of that unlawfulness so as to render them inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.887" offset="13102895">Now, the legal standard for a narcotics agent to arrest without warrant as established by 26 U.S.C. 7607 has reasonable grounds to believe that person to be arrested has committed or is committing a Narcotics offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.922" offset="13167052">This Court in the Draper case in 358 U.S. ruled that the reasonable grounds of that statute is the equivalent of the probable cause for the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.249" offset="13212400">This standard has been articulated by the Courts to mean that all of the facts and circumstances taken together must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable and experienced peace officer in believing that an offense has been or is being committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.587" offset="13277706">And that it is in these terms we submit that this case must be approached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.011" offset="13295365">The conduct we're inquiring into is that of federal law enforcement officers doing their conscientious best to control a vicious and elusive vice, a narcotics traffic, and as we consider the events that took place on the morning of June 4th, 1959, at each stage of the way we must ask ourselves, “What was it reasonable for this men to do?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.369" offset="13392854">Indeed, I urged each member of this Court to ask himself at each stage what he would have done, what alternatives he would have seen as available to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3357.454" offset="13533184">Between 5:30 and six o'clock in the morning on this particular morning, a federal narcotics agent was told by an informant that he had purchased narcotics the previous day from Blackie Toy at a laundry on Leavenworth Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.075" offset="13587623">Now, this was not an anonymous phone -- phone call, it wasn't a whispered tip on a street corner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3381.601" offset="13629733">It was given at the Narcotics Bureau Office by one Hom Way who was then under arrest having been found in the possession of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.960" offset="13659199">Although -- though this was the first he had ever given information on narcotics traffic to the agent, the agent had known him for six weeks and the agent testified a trial to his belief that Hom Way was reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.460" offset="13713220">The fact that Hom Way was under arrest meant of course as he no doubt knew that the information would be checked out, and he would be confronted with any inconsistency and we submit that this element provides a substantial element of reliability to Hom Way's information.</text>

            <text syncTime="3744.590" offset="15081723">Actually, the question I'd like to ask at this point Your Honor is just what should the agent have done at that point, we submit that whatever he did, he had to do it rather quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.345" offset="15140760">I think it was reasonable for agents engaged in trying to control narcotics traffic would fear that the news of Hom Way's arrest might get back to his alleged supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.679" offset="15198124">And that that alleged supplier might escape, might warn the confederates, might destroy or conceal narcotics, which is of course a particularly difficult problem when you're dealing with narcotics traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.602" offset="15249742">Now, should he seek an arrest warrant?</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.613" offset="15261863">Apart from the delay that would be involved, of course, there would be a delay involved considering that this happened at 6:30 in the morning that the information actually was at 5:30 or 6:00 in the morning, perhaps the prudent cautious agent would not be fully satisfied that this was probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.353" offset="15332812">Looking at it from the agent's point of view, not from the (Inaudible) of the courtroom, but from where he stood, perhaps, he felt that wasn't quite enough to go on and that perhaps he'd better he'd check the information out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.873" offset="15386833">It was then daylight, only about two hours before business establishments open for the day, and so it was decided that the agents would investigate further and they were dispatched to the premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="4992.200" offset="20072155">And obviously, the agent had foremost in his mind, the information that he had no doubt narcotics agents are very much -- very acutely aware of the ease of destruction of narcotics and that certainly figures into their thinking, no doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.131" offset="20147911">Now, we submit that there can be no serious question as to the legality of petitioner Wong Sun's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.057" offset="20183646">We believe that the agents had more than ample cause to arrest him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.335" offset="20204753">After Johnny Yee had surrendered the narcotics, he said that he had received them from Toy and from one Sea Dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.249" offset="20240384">Now, this statement was hardly corroborated again by the fact that he had narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.481" offset="20261282">This wasn't a statement that he was just making for the fun of it or spite.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.018" offset="20287404">There was some corroboration from the fact that he actually had narcotics himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.669" offset="20306004">It was further corroborated by the fact that Toy had already disclosed his familiarity with Yee by the fact that Toy had correctly specified the amount of narcotics that the agents could expect to find at Yee's place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.445" offset="20365145">And Toy thereupon identified Wong Sun as Sea Dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.258" offset="20388446">Now, this fact is an important fact because it also corroborates Yee's statement because it indicates that Toy and Wong Sun were familiar with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.321" offset="20436616">And of course this was further corroborated and an additional bit of information which developed when Toy actually went along with the agents and showed them where Wong Sun lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.416" offset="20489070">We believe that it's really difficult to imagine what more could be asked for in the way of probable cause for an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.119" offset="20519894">Moreover, substantially the same factors that require the agents to move quickly with respect to Toy obtained, we submit, with respect to Wong Sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.403" offset="20569004">Two of the persons with whom he was dealing in narcotics had now been arrested, Toy and Yee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.598" offset="20601814">And since Yee had identified him as a supplier, the agents could reasonably suppose that he had narcotics, and upon learning of these arrests that he might well destroy them nor we submit as the record disclosed anything improper about the manner in which the arrest took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.498" offset="20685406">Now, of course, if as we contend that the petitioner's arrest were lawful, the petitioner's challenges to the admissibility of the evidence fall at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.255" offset="20728351">We believe, however, that even if the arrests were unlawful, the challenged evidence was admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.334" offset="20756668">Now, of course, the Silverthorne, in Nardone cases have established beyond any questions drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.892" offset="20778924">The evidence which is the product of an illegal governmental action is not admissible in a federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.156" offset="20812048">However, both of those decisions recognized that there are reasonable limits to the reach of this doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.210" offset="20836185">Nardone, the Court said that the connection between the governmental action and the evidence that I quote “May have become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.899" offset="20886967">Perhaps the most notable class of cases in which the Courts have found the connection to attenuate it for the application of the exclusionary rule are those involving a voluntary statement made shortly after an illegal arrest with surprising consistency, both state and federal courts generally held that genuinely voluntary statements made in the course of an unlawful arrest cannot be regarded as the product of that arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.319" offset="20996681">We've set forth some of those cases on pages 42 and 43 of our brief and a complete list is to be found in the article by Professor Kamisar which we have cited and that's at page 81 of his article.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.332" offset="21048717">This Court has never ruled directly on the point although such cases as the Bayer case in 331 U.S. seemed to us to proceed on the same essential assumptions as these lower court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.914" offset="21103052">There, the defendant had made a confession that was unlawful under the McNabb rule, and thereafter he made a second one based on the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.092" offset="21143698">The Court although recognizing and I quote, “A later confession always maybe looked upon as fruit of the first” still held the exclusionary rule to be inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.212" offset="21188211">We believe that the rationale of these cases particularly as I say, the state and federal lower court cases that have developed the position I've suggested, is that a genuinely voluntary statement constitutes an intervening independent act of a freewill that breaks the chain of causation between the arrest and the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.478" offset="21285282">That these cases recognized that when the police acquired voluntary statements such as that involved in this case, it's purely fortuitous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.284" offset="21324466">And therefore, it's relatively unlikely that the police are going to make an unlawful arrest in order to obtain voluntary statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.947" offset="21355186">Thus, the minimal deterrent effect of excluding such statement is outweighed by the public interest in convicting the guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="5458.829" offset="21938657">Such acts could of course, scarcely be held to be voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.101" offset="21955793">Also, when an illegally arrested defendant is confronted with illegally obtained evidence, the courts have often held that that does not present a sufficient level of voluntariness as to allow the admission of the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="5504.230" offset="22120260">Now, we submit that a reading of the record clearly discloses that this statement was completely unsolicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.625" offset="22153906">And that we submit is an important element to take into account in determining just how voluntary it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.095" offset="22179715">It was not an answer to a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.536" offset="22193507">Toy was informed by the agents as the record shows on page 63.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.868" offset="22210853">He was informed by the agents that he had been named by Hom Way as possessing narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.950" offset="22255156">Petitioner said, “No, I haven't been selling narcotics at all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.774" offset="22270516">Then he said, “However, I do know somebody who has” and we submit that there was nothing about his arrest that caused -- that made the petitioner accuse Yee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.580" offset="22313671">No evidence was found at his place and no doubt he knew no evidence was going to be found in his place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.544" offset="22333524">So there was nothing for him to explain a way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.459" offset="22345226">As the court below found nothing in the record so much as hints at coercion or involuntariness and I think it's important to note that neither a trial nor an appeal that the petitioner ever so contend, the contention was simply that as a matter of law if there is an unlawful arrest that the statement would fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.431" offset="22433102">Indeed, we suggest, that it is an even more clearly admissible than the ordinary voluntary statement because here Toy deliberately sought to divert suspicion from himself by sidetracking the agents in the direction of Yee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.156" offset="22492035">No doubt he was quite hopeful that Yee would have by then destroyed the evidence or that he may have used it up by then in any event it seems quite clear and I think counsel recognized this that Toy certainly was not intending to implicate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.187" offset="22560162">And we suggest this case as quite analogous to cases in which offers of bribes to officers had been held to be -- had been held to be admissible even though made in the course of an unlawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.536" offset="22617527">We've cited a couple of those cases on page 48 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="5754.081" offset="23119705">Now, I think it's important to note that that comes quite a bit after he had actually made the statement, volunteered the statement that he knew where there was some.</text>
            <text syncTime="5762.840" offset="23154709">But you're quite right in suggesting that there are certainly is -- that there certainly are the elements of a violation of the act in that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5771.900" offset="23190967">Now, we submit that there is no basis whatsoever for a challenge to the admissibility of the narcotics themselves here to taint any unlawful arrest was attenuated by not one but two voluntary independent acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5786.127" offset="23247914">Toy's implication of Yee and then Yee's voluntary surrender of the narcotics, and there is nothing in the record, nothing at all to suggest that the surrender of the narcotics by Yee was anything but completely voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.175" offset="23308100">We submit that there's no basis in law or indeed in common sense for stretching the exclusionary rules so far as to cover the narcotics surrendered by Yee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.010" offset="23347388">Finally, the petitioners of course challenged the admissibility of the confessions that they made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.895" offset="23371003">Each of these statement -- statements was made after petitioners' had been arraigned and freed on their own recognizance -- recognizance and each of the petitioners was fully advised at the time he made the statement of his rights -- his right to counsel and his right not to make any statement, in fact that any statement might be held against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5838.255" offset="23456371">Now, the challenge to Toy's confession would seem, we think, to fall by virtue of the Bayer case where at the very worst, it was only a second confession made after an unlawfully obtained statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5852.851" offset="23514781">And as to petitioner Wong Sun's confession and indeed as to all of the evidence that corroborated it, we are unable to proceed any basis for the exclusion of that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5863.411" offset="23556995">There's nothing in the record that forms even the most tenuous link between Wong Sun's arrest and any of the evidence that was used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.972" offset="23591267">His confession was made four days after he'd been arraigned and freed on his own recognizance and the narcotics, which constitute the principal corroboration were of course surrendered before he was even arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5884.680" offset="23642049">And as to the possibility that Wong Sun's confess -- confession was the product of Toy's unlawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5891.828" offset="23670680">No court has ever suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.791" offset="23678516">Indeed, I wonder if any court has even been asked to rule that the Silverthorne and Nardone doctrine could be stretched so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="5901.391" offset="23708923">Between Toy's arrest and Wong Sun's arrest were at least five intervening acts, voluntary acts, Toy's implication of Yee, Yee surrender of the narcotics, Yee's later implication of Wong Sun, Toy's identification of Wong Sun and then Toy's later guiding the agents to Wong Sun's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.883" offset="23790947">As I said, there's no basis for any link between that arrest and the confession four days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.930" offset="23815084">We believe it would make a mockery of the exclusionary rule to say that the evidence of Wong Sun's guilt was in any legally relevant sense, a product of Toy's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5940.384" offset="23864926">Now, we submit that only the detailed confessions of the petitioners voluntarily made and fully admissible, but today were sufficiently corroborated by outside evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.225" offset="23920306">We have set forth in our brief the evidence corroborating the various elements of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5959.833" offset="23942666">That's at pages 54 and 63.</text>
            <text syncTime="5962.005" offset="23951444">But I do wish to deal briefly with the point that counsel has raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5967.971" offset="23975267">Petitioners contend that there was no corroboration for their knowledge that the heroin had been unlawfully imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.250" offset="24012361">Now, of course this element of the offense is applied by the statutory presumption arising out of unexplained possession of the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.253" offset="24044335">That's in 21 U.S.C. 174, plainly, the presumption which itself arises outside of the confession does not need corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.628" offset="24085922">It had to be corroborated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.751" offset="24090415">We question what would be the point of having the presumption in the first place, it assumes that evidence of that character is virtually impossible to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="6005.248" offset="24124374">And we submit the element of possession itself was adequate -- adequately corroborated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.598" offset="24153736">The corroboration, and of course the corroboration, as the Smith case pointed out, does not have to be in itself a complete statement of the particular element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.938" offset="24207130">It must merely support the believability of the element in the confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="6176.940" offset="24811081">Now, we believe that the primary corroborations of the fact -- oh, I might, I might add one additional point and that is of course that, as you pointed out Mr. Justice Brennan, at the time he actually turned over the narcotics to -- at the time he implicated Yee, he made an additional statement indicating his knowledge of what Yee had and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.091" offset="24919751">The surrender of the narcotics by Yee is, we believe, is the most persuasive element of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6212.430" offset="24953083">At his own establishment, he had indicated his knowledge of the quantity that Yee had.</text>

            <text syncTime="6232.507" offset="25033435">And this was -- the absence of an ounce was in fact an element corroborating this because Toy in his confession stated that on the occasions of these deliveries, “We've been smoking a little bit ourselves.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6249.346" offset="25100727">And then of course he also said that on the third of June which was the night before he was arrested, he had gone again and smoke some, so that would account for the missing gram of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.718" offset="25146284">Now, his familiarity with Yee's house, we submit, was an important element of corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="6269.686" offset="25182124">He very carefully described just where the house was.</text>
            <text syncTime="6274.824" offset="25202709">The agents went there unerringly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6277.571" offset="25213680">And Yee's testimony that Yee and Toy had known one another, this is testimony at trial, that Yee and Toy had known one another for seven or eight years, corroborated the whole course of confession that he had made these many visits to Yee's house in which they brought narcotics on each occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6297.137" offset="25291943">The fact that he knew as I say how much was there, it was an important corroboration and the fact that he had been there the night before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.243" offset="25328306">We submit that this spelled out in, perhaps more articulate more complete detail in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.151" offset="25355995">We believe that all of that quite adequately corroborated the confession of Toy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.855" offset="25378774">We do emphasize Toy attempted to be fairly clever in his confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="6327.015" offset="25411480">He didn't actually come out and state, I did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6331.335" offset="25428720">He didn't come out and really admit every -- every element except the one provided by the statutory presumption as Wong Sun did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.466" offset="25461217">But we believe that without any question, the various elements of corroboration notably the actual surrender of narcotics by Yee, provided complete corroboration to cover every element of the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="6528.698" offset="26218141">I don't like to get into an argument that the Government held so with respect to what the record says but I fear that it is necessary here because I'm afraid that an erroneous impression has been left with respect to the state of the record as a result of some questions that have been propounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="6549.638" offset="26301942">I believe that it was Mr. Justice Brennan who this morning asked the question whether or not Alton Wong said through a close door I've come here for my laundry or whether the door was open at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6567.900" offset="26374980">And I understood Government counsel to suggest to the Court that it was necessary for him to perpetrate this ruse on Mr. Toy in order to get him to open the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="6582.751" offset="26434330">Well, the record is to the contrary on that, the record at page 38 is as follows: “Mr. Toy, the first time you saw the Chinese narcotics agent was in the morning when he knocked on the door of the laundry, is that right?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6599.270" offset="26500472">“He rang the bell.”</text>

            <text syncTime="6604.359" offset="26520848">Question: “And then the agent showed you a badge, didn't he?”</text>

            <text syncTime="6620.326" offset="26584691">So that I think the record is quite clear that the door had been opened by the occupant and it was not necessary to attempt any ruse on him in order to get him to open the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="6633.796" offset="26638608">Now secondly, the question has been raised with respect to petitioner Toy's fluency with the English language.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.311" offset="26684583">And the suggestion was made to the Court that the necessity for an interpreter arose not because of Toy's lack of fluency with the English language but because of Sun's lack of familiarity with the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="6661.034" offset="26747486">I think that the record as to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6664.502" offset="26761383">At page 39, when Toy was on the witness stand testifying, the following colloquy took place and I quote from the top of page 39, Mr. Abrams who was the trial counsel for the defense in this case outside, “Alright, may I ask that the interpreter make that clear to the witness where this conversation had taken place?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6690.275" offset="26864515">Government counsel, Mr. Rearton (ph), “He is answering in English.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6693.111" offset="26875800">The Court: “Yes, he is answering in English and as I understand it he and the interpreter are discussing these things together.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6701.196" offset="26908191">In addition to this record reference at pages 11, 16, 68, and 72, there is further demonstration of the need for an interpreter during the course of the trial for both of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="6721.536" offset="26989484">Again, in response to a question posed by Mr. Justice Brennan also this morning as to whether or not there was anything incriminating in the threshold statement made by Toy immediately on his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6743.476" offset="27077256">I responded that he had admitted his presence in Yee's premises the night before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6750.357" offset="27104841">Then during interrogation of Government counsel, it was suggested that the only supporting record reference for that was a statement by the District Attorney who of course was not qualified to testify with respect to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6764.544" offset="27161579">But at page 63 of the record, agent Nicolov is testifying to the statement made by petitioner Toy immediately upon his arrest in his bedroom on the morning of June 4th.</text>
            <text syncTime="6783.283" offset="27236498">And what does he say?</text>
            <text syncTime="6786.540" offset="27249560">And I'm reading from almost the center of the page at page 63.</text>
            <text syncTime="6791.802" offset="27270562">He said it was -- he described the house to us, it was a remodeled front of the house with a white trim, sort of beige color and he said he had been there the night before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6804.701" offset="27322180">And we asked him how much stuff, I asked him how much stuff Johnny had.</text>
            <text syncTime="6808.658" offset="27337958">And he said he had about a piece and that Johnny had a bedroom here, it was his folk's house and the bedroom was upstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6814.621" offset="27361886">So the record does show that petitioner Toy on the very threshold of his rest -- arrest admitted his presence in Yee's premises the night before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6826.508" offset="27409429">Now, counsel said that at pages 42 and 43 of the Government's brief, there is cited a line of authority to verge in from that to which I call the Court's attention suggesting that evidence oral in nature on the threshold of an illegal arrest is admissible or has been held admissible by the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6849.508" offset="27501380">I respectfully disagree with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6852.027" offset="27511515">He cites three cases there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6854.536" offset="27521546">He cites the case of Smith against the United States, United States against Walker, and Gibson against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6861.487" offset="27549341">In Smith against the United States, the Court used this specific language, it said the difference between the facts in the Nueslein case and the instant cases are apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6872.680" offset="27594062">In Nueslein there was no probable cause for arrest of Nueslein up to the time the search was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6880.122" offset="27623842">Here, probable cause existed to believe a felony had been committed and that Smith had committed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6886.555" offset="27649546">So the Court of Appeals validated that arrest and that's why the statement was allowed in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6892.843" offset="27674728">Again, in United States against Walker, likewise cited by the Government in supporting its theory on the federal exclusionary rule, the Court specifically said this, and I quote, “In our opinion appellant has not established his arrest was illegal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6913.071" offset="27755708">So that neither of these case support what the Government contends for in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6917.842" offset="27774725">Now they cite a file case, Gibson against the United States, a District of Columbia case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6944.356" offset="27880782">He returned the next day and repeated the incriminatory statement voluntarily, and the Court of Appeals could not see the prejudicial error in allowing in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6957.427" offset="27933132">But for whatever that case may hold that gives consolation to the Government, on Thursday last, the Court of Appeals emasculated this decision in Killough against the United States by holding that an immediately subsequent confession after a violation of Rule 5, a subsequent confession made not during the period of illegal detention, must be regarded as fruit of the poison tree and they struck it down on Thursday, October 4, 1962.</text>
