            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 158, Willard Carnley, Petitioner, versus H.G. Cochran, Jr., Director of the Division of Corrections.</text>

            <label>Mr. James G. Mahorner</label>
            <text syncTime="16.133" offset="167894">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.010" offset="195375">We have attempted to illustrate that there are no unu -- unusual happenings in the trial of the present petitioner which indicates an unfairness on the part of the court or the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.228" offset="252322">There is not alleged any feeble not -- or youthfulness by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.503" offset="277400">There's one other factor that should be considered before this Court -- before this case can be said to be within the Betts v. Brady ground, and that is whether this particular charge, or the particular charge of the incest child fondling was so complex that it required a counsel to represent the petitioner, otherwise, he was not given fair play.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.165" offset="384084">Now, there were some supposed complexities in this charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.305" offset="404564">The petitioner was indicted on two counts, incest and child fondling.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.278" offset="428492">It could be said that it should have been only one crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.569" offset="445628">A coun -- counsel could have require -- might have persuaded the court to sentence on only one crime, but it was decided in the petitioners favor by sentencing petitioner within the permissible term allowed under either count rather than sentencing petitioner two consecutive -- to two consecutive terms, one under each count.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.668" offset="562030">Now, it's been brought up that the Court had the discretion of giving psychiatric treatment to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.171" offset="596093">However, it is not alleged and it is not the case that such psychiatric treatment is in lieu of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.330" offset="628694">It's in addition to sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.880" offset="634859">It is something that takes place before sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.671" offset="646040">Before trial, the man still goes on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.038" offset="667564">The Court could have exercised this discretion to -- to give psychiatric treatment that the man had no legal right to psychiatric treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.347" offset="704763">There is always present an element of discretion in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.948" offset="719182">The Court could have sentenced the man to only one year, but the question of complexity comes up not in discretion, but where -- where the Court, where we have a legal issue, where it becomes mandatory on the Court to give this man a sentence on only one count because the two counts constitute one, where possibly there is no crime for assault to commit second degree murder, where there is a legal right involved and not where there's a discretionary right involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.512" offset="845406">And we say here that there was no unusual dis -- legal right involved which was not in the ultimate decided in favor of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.809" offset="886575">Furthermore, in the case of Bute v. Illinois, the same crime was before the court -- before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.520" offset="913429">And there was no finding that this -- this type of crime involves such complexities that a counsel per se was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.924" offset="967032">Now, we are faced -- we feel at this point that all we have is that conceding for the sake of argument, the petitioner did successfully alleged indigent so I brought it up that it was not alleged in his original petition and it's somewhat ambiguously alleged in his reply brief in reply to our response.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.536" offset="1045504">But assuming that he's alleged in a -- and assuming that he's successfully, which he definitely has alleged lack of education, we have no other factors which do not coincide with Betts v. Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.888" offset="1118960">In Betts the man was indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.089" offset="1127737">In Betts the man who was a farm laborer as indicated by the dissent which is certainly valid for supp -- supporting the factual situation surrounding the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.811" offset="1170578">The indication is, though not direct, the man as a farm laborer did not have a great deal of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.476" offset="1201298">We now come to whether Betts v. Brady should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.630" offset="1225853">Yesterday, I had attempted to lay what turned out to be a fallacious argument because my original premise was wrong and ideas that Mapp v. Ohio did not have a retrospect effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.931" offset="1283114">We do just want to say in passing that unless the Court is prepared to release every man who is now serving any sentence no matter whether they were convicted 20 to 60 to 70 years ago if he's serving a life sentence on the grounds that at his trial, there was the illegably obtained evidence used or on the grounds that at his trial, there was lack of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.520" offset="1385409">And they are not prepared to give this great retrospect to -- effect to these two cases, assuming that Betts v. Brady is reversed, well then, they cannot consistently allow Betts v. Brady to be reversed on collateral attack by habeas corpus but should wait until it's being -- until there is a chance to reverse it on direct attack by a direct review of a lower state decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.070" offset="2355702">However, the right to appeal is not a constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.320" offset="2384645">I do not think this Court would hold it that if the Constitution specifically provided a right to hold property that the State was now under an obligation to give property to those people who did not have property.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.372" offset="2432815">There is a stronger argument where the State itself rather than in a Constitution, where the state tends to set out the mechanism that there is possible discrimination if the state does not carry it on through, and give it not only to the wealthy but to the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.353" offset="2500733">But here, if it's an original right setup in the Constitution, such as property, could very well be by specific terms and possibly is by indirect terms, a direct specific term saying “You shall have the sacred right to hold property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="613.967" offset="2559248">I certainly do not think that reasoning would prevail that the State was now under an obligation to give the poor that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.492" offset="2589341">And likewise, where the Constitution said, “You shall have a right to have counsel,” the state should not be under the obligation to give the man that right if he himself cannot acquire it.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.168" offset="2644093">We feel that the background of England points that the – the common law background that this Constitution was originally constructed in points out that what this means in the same way that a term would have manically were given you the right to hold property where to meant that you have the right to acquire it if financially able that in -- in England at the time the Constitution was drawn up these amendments were put it in as late as 1838, a man was not allowed to come before the Court with counsel whatsoever regardless of his financial attributes, and at this provision the Constitution was put there for the purpose of overcoming this practice which was, by the way, highly criticized in England at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.292" offset="2820577">Now, we further feel that a jury -- the right to jury could much more readily be interpreted as being required of the states than the right then that the states be required to appoint counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.639" offset="2889958">Not only do you have to – apply in the counsel provision, not only do you have to first determine that you have the right to appear before a state court with counsel, which you have to do in determining the jury issue that you have this right to appear before the state court before a jury, but you also then have to go the further step of determining that if the man is indigent, the State must appoint counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.462" offset="3021197">We further feel that an instrument such as the Constitution which provides that this man could serve as President of the United States or it could sit on this Court does not anticipate his being held to be in at able -- unable to defend himself when charged with a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.237" offset="3092355">An instrument which gives him this much recognition certainly did not intend that he be held not able to represent himself when charged to the crime.</text>
