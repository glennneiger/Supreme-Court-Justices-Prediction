            <text syncTime="54.111" offset="319822">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.270" offset="336436">This is a civil action brought in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in which the petitioner seeks to reform for an alternative rescind and agreement entered into between her and the respondent and the ground of the fraud of the respondent or a mutual mistake of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.900" offset="415013">Respondent appeared especially and moved to dismiss petitioner's complaint on the ground that the Court lacked jurisdiction over the person of the respondent and the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.329" offset="464645">A New York special term judge dismissed the complaint on the ground of a lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.030" offset="495470">The appellate division affirmed in the New York Court of Appeals in a four to three decisions affirmed on the grounds that the respondent was immune from the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.505" offset="541341">Subsequent to the decision, the remittitur was amended to show that upon the appeal that was presented and necessarily passed upon a question under the Constitution of the United States to with but their plaintiff was deprived of just compensation in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.452" offset="629217">The New York Court of Appeals held there was no such deprivation or violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.942" offset="647189">The United State Supreme Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.956" offset="663176">The petitioner now seeks to have this Court reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the New York Supreme Court for trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.119" offset="711868">The facts of this case are most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.607" offset="725765">Petitioner and her husband are elderly town's people living in town -- in the Village of Hamburg outside of Buffalo, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.225" offset="760247">Petitioner owned a large track of land outside of Buffalo fronting on a main highway that she had received by inheritance.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.453" offset="801207">The New York State Thruway Authority, the respondent, under its power of eminent domain appropriated a strip of land through this track which effectively bisected the track of land and making -- and made the rear portion of the track which was in fact the major portion of the track completely inaccessible.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.316" offset="892635">Under the New York Appropriation method, title passed immediately upon the filing of the maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.289" offset="928580">The respondent, Thruway Authority, employs agents whose job it is to go around to these persons whose land has been appropriated to get what they called agreements of adjustment with them whereby they attempt to agree on a price to be paid for the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.663" offset="1002036">One of these agents came to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.200" offset="1016142">And after much negotiation, it was agreed that the price which was to be paid would be $3500 in cash plus 90% of the value of the rear track of land which had been rendered practically useless by this appropriation, plus the cost of the purchase of an excess route which would allow you at least to obtain access to backtrack.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.098" offset="1127737">Now, the agreement was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.197" offset="1140172">And this agreement recites only the sum of $3500 and purports to be in full compensation for the land which was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.538" offset="1177475">The agent, however, at the time of the execution of the contract stated that the $3500 which was expressed in the agreement was only part of the compensation which was to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.667" offset="1230033">Now, we have alleged in our complaint and the allegation must be accepted as true for the purpose of this proceeding, that $3500 represented but at one-twentieth of the value of this property which was taken and that the petitioner has in fact been deprived of the sum of $70,000 by this action on the part of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.375" offset="1316864">And as we say, that is a premise we must be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.555" offset="1333582">Though subsequent to the execution of this agreement, petitioner sought to obtain the money which she felt was coming to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.170" offset="1376005">These representations were repeatedly -- repeated by the representatives of the State and petitioner, being an elderly person as I've said, relied upon these representations made by the representatives of the State and she consistently refused to accept the $3500 check which was offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.371" offset="1456880">And finally, she consulted her attorney and found the true nature of the agreement and action was promptly brought in the Supreme Court of the State of New York to rescind or reform this agreement, to show the true nature of the agreement or what petitioner felt that the agreement that has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.039" offset="1535561">The defendant respondent appeared in the proceeding, especially claims sovereign immunity and this claim has been consistently upheld throughout the courts of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.471" offset="1593240">Now, petitioner's contentions are very basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.193" offset="1608182">One, just compensation is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to a person whose properly is taken for public use.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.512" offset="1645380">Secondly, a state cannot interpose sovereign immunity as a defense to a claim arising out of a taking without payment of just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.344" offset="1688743">And thirdly, that even if a state were so immune, it could not and it cannot delegate this immunity to a public corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.684" offset="1738062">Now, as to our first contention, it is clear the just compensation has been denied the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.032" offset="1763453">It has been said that the taking of property for public use without payment is tyranny.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.492" offset="1789367">It is therefore been a requirement from the beginning of this nation, from Constitution that just compensation be paid and as for the Federal Government, this was embodied in the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.474" offset="1849240">As to the States, it was clearly held that it was embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.913" offset="1879019">Just compensation has been defined as the full and perfect equivalent for property taken and that must be fixed either by agreement or by judicial inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.952" offset="1943176">Now, petitioner's compensation was fixed by neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.279" offset="1964492">There was no more of an agreement here than if the gun had been placed to the petitioner's head and she had been directed to sign this alleged agreement for the courts recognized little difference between fraud and duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.289" offset="2024573">There was no meeting of the minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.097" offset="2035754">We have alleged and it must be accepted as true a mutual mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.152" offset="2056025">The paper that was written did not express the agreement of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.777" offset="2078490">Therefore, there is no agreed upon compensations.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.111" offset="2095835">Petitioner, therefore, has --</text>

            <text syncTime="539.946" offset="2263124">Forgive me to my procedural of jurisdictional difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.493" offset="2281305">I'm well aware of the fact that the Court of Appeals of New York amended the remittitur.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.136" offset="2299904">It says they passed on a question under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.123" offset="2319862">I'm also aware of the fact that this Court has said that not even the Court of Appeals or any other state court can amend its remittitur and inject the question into a litigation which wasn't before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.038" offset="2375555">I find nothing in either opinion of the court or the dissenting opinion which deals with anything except the power or except the statutory interpretation of the provisions of the New York law as to the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.113" offset="2451832">The greatest difficulty saying that simply because counsel persuaded or the Chief Judge of New York Court of Appeals whom I greatly respect said, “Oh yes, that will inject the Fourteenth Amendment problem that we can take it even that wasn't an issue at all, if New York chooses not to confer that jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims, that is its business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="612.111" offset="2551829">And you're right, so aren't they protected by going to the federal courts if you haven't got any redressed or taking a property without compensation under New York law.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lauren D. Rachlin</label>
            <text syncTime="621.660" offset="2589968">Well, if it please the Court, our contention from the very beginning was that if the state court refused to accept jurisdiction of this case that such refusal to accept jurisdiction and refusal thereby to give the plaintiff, the petitioner of a just compensation which he was guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment would then constitute a deprivation of property without just compensation and therefore, constitute a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="659.907" offset="2743045">If New York chooses not to have courts which entertain these claims, this Court can confer that jurisdiction by saying you have a federal right, the federal constitution amply enforceable in federal courts.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lauren D. Rachlin</label>
            <text syncTime="674.322" offset="2800619">The fact is that the New York courts -- let's say prior to the decision in the Benz case, and in fact constitutionally under the New York State Constitution have established the Supreme Court of the State of New York as a court of general jurisdiction in law and equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.221" offset="2876270">By the Constitution of the State of New York and under the Strang case and the Pantess case, it was specifically so held that the Supreme Court of the State of New York had jurisdiction, full jurisdiction over this -- this authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="728.145" offset="3015973">Well the -- this was of course -- our contention from the very first of this -- in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.208" offset="3044185">We established, as I've said, the fact that there was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.126" offset="3071875">But -- by this agreement which was -- as I say either mistakenly drafted or fraudulently drafted, there was a deprivation of property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.872" offset="3122866">Now, we say that the -- that sovereign immunity is no defense to a taking by a state under the power of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.082" offset="3171662">The respondent conceded this point but states that petitioner's action to rescind or reform the agreement, fixing the price does not constitute an act of -- does not involve an act of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.382" offset="3228923">They contend that the subject matter was irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.190" offset="3244178">But the subject matter is very important and because petitioner's basic claim here is for just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.289" offset="3276570">The subject matter of the land is -- the subject matter of the agreement is land which was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.271" offset="3304469">No provision is made for compensation at the time of the appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.328" offset="3324635">Now, if there were nothing else, you would of course have to strike down the compen -- the statute which provides for the appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.718" offset="3358281">The statute does provide, however, for either determination by the Court of Claims or in the alternative an agreement of adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.743" offset="3390360">Compensation is then fraudulently determined or as we say properly determined and mistakenly set forth in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.885" offset="3426931">The agreement, therefore, does not provide for just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.630" offset="3445844">Now, you come to the second deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.460" offset="3457233">The state court refuses jurisdiction to rescind or reform the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.282" offset="3484505">And therefore, we have two state instrumentalities which are parti -- participating in this deprivation of right under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.046" offset="3519509">One is the fraudulent agent under the cost of action based on fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.403" offset="3536959">The second is the state court's refusal to hear the case on the ground of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.876" offset="3558902">And state court action has been held as we know of to constitute state action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1761.785" offset="7150529">It's a question of whether a department or an agency or a public corporation which this in fact is can partake of the immunity of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.452" offset="7189191">And this I think is a federal question because after all it's a question of whether the immunity which is in -- in effect granted by the Eleventh Amendment can be delegated by that state and again if I can quote from -- from the Hopkins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.937" offset="7259094">But immunity from suit is a high attribute of sovereignty, a prerogative of the State -- excuse me of the State itself which cannot be availed of by public agents when sued from their own torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.797" offset="7314578">The whole frame and scheme of the political institutions of this country state and federal, protest against expanding to any agent the sovereign exemption from legal process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.254" offset="7404440">South Carolina State Court, You Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.020" offset="7455431">Now, we've contended that even if the State is immune from suit that it cannot delegate its immunity to a public corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.870" offset="7486882">Now, the growth of the public authority is one of the most important single developments in -- in this particular area of the law in the last several decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.250" offset="7524394">New York alone has over 100 public authorities in -- involves in the State of New York a multibillion dollar operation and this can be multiplied by 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.120" offset="7567862">The purpose of the public corporation is to provide independent autonomous operation to protect the state from liability and at the same time, re -- avoid the restrictions which are normally takes place upon the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.179" offset="7628048">Thus the Thruway Authority, the members of the authority are under the -- the Board for nine year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.847" offset="7662738">They have the right to issue fines, to fix tolls, to take land, to enter contracts, to police their own facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.938" offset="7695130">They have the full powers of a public corporation including the right to sue and be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.011" offset="7715401">They are not directly responsible to the State or to the local Government nor are they even responsible to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.531" offset="7753540">Now, under the Benz decision, they are not even responsible to the courts and as I say, they have achieved the degree of autonomous irresponsibility that has -- has been completely unknown in our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.165" offset="7816025">And according to a law review article which I cite in my brief, this presents, “A fertile area for sovereign irresponsibility.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.148" offset="7867956">Now, we make a final -- or I should say this about the -- the Hopkins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.968" offset="7911215">They -- the discussions which we mentioned does talk about the public corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.340" offset="7932740">And then it goes in, in the very last paragraph or two, they indicate that if the dike had to be removed, if that there was affirmative action required by the State that in that event, they have to make the state a party and the state would be in that case immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.218" offset="8000240">But I contend that this is far different from saying that the State made by naked power deprived the petitioner of her property without just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.510" offset="8041409">It is -- excuse me, different from saying that although the federal court, the federal constitution provides a rate of just compensation that the State can say as it did sovereign immunity is not affected by the essence of a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.284" offset="8112462">Now, I did take the opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.127" offset="8127927">Our time is coming close to an end, the opportunity to look into the constitutional history of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.578" offset="8161677">To see what was said whether that the time the Fourteenth Amendment was passed whether, they concerned themselves on the issue of sovereign immunity as opposed to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.292" offset="8200547">And I think it's clear that this is -- the primary concern was the right of the individual, not the right of the State, the feeling at that time throughout the entire congressional record was not one of concern for the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.536" offset="8261465">There were concern to protect by national law the privileges and immunities of all the citizens of the republic.</text>
