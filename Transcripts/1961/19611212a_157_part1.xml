            <text syncTime="49.407" offset="301014">The group of contempt cases which the Court has been hearing during the past few days has dealt with a rather broad range of subjects on the Federal Criminal Law and its relationship to the constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.876" offset="374888">The case to which we now task Coppedge against the United States deals with many other aspect of the relationship between the Federal Criminal Law and the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.707" offset="430164">And the range of the subject is broad and the subjects are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.082" offset="455659">The subjects include the very difficult and perplexing problem of the administration of justice in in forma pauperis cases in the federal court and the assurance that equal justice on the law shall be rendered to the poor as well as to the rich.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.360" offset="536848">It includes problems as to the responsibilities of the grand jury of the Court of the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.247" offset="576345">It includes questions of evidence and charges to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.259" offset="596407">It includes questions of prejudicial summation as the petitioner view with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.617" offset="633814">Now, as the governor -- Government views the case according to its brief in this Court, all of the petitioner's contentions are frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.444" offset="669132">The Government says this in 53 pages of its preventive brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.323" offset="696613">For this reason, I should like just to pause a moment on the procedure which is taken place in the efforts of this petitioner to obtain an appellant review on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.620" offset="937880">His conviction at the first trial having been reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit because prejudicial newspaper articles had appeared during the course of the trial and because the Court of Appeals felt that Judge Holtzoff, who had acted as the trial Judge in the first trial of the case, had not taken sufficient steps to assure that the prejudice would not affect deliberations of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.909" offset="1058983">When the case was remanded, it was tried again.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.249" offset="1072358">And at the second trial, petitioner was represented by court appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.195" offset="1096182">After the jury's verdict was brought in and a verdict to guilty on count three through 10, the petitioner having been acquitted by the jury on the so-called housebreaking and blartney charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.349" offset="1144769">After the verdict was brought in, petitioner was sentenced by Judge Holtzoff and then he sought in the usual course to take an appeal in forma pauperis stating an indigent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.613" offset="8497821">And his failure to do it means that this petitioner has been deprived of the kind of hearing his entitled to whether by hearing the witnesses personally by affidavits or by anything else.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.755" offset="8618402">I'm reminded out by Mr. Justice Frankfurter's summary of Judge McGuire's decision mainly that Judge McGuire said, "Well, I've looked at the grand jury minutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2148.734" offset="8698337">He's the only one who has looked at them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.962" offset="8707218">And see what there was to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.612" offset="8713801">And he was denied access to the minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.667" offset="8722056">And when I try to appeal in the Court of Appeals and was rethought, I said in the Court of Appeals that it was hard to have denied access to the grand jury minutes -- petitioner's counsel but in any event, even if you are going to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.816" offset="8790601">At the very minimum, the Court of Appeals has an obligation to look in camera at the grand jury minutes to see whether Judge McGuire was right but whether the perjured evidence was the entire evidence in implicating petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.853" offset="8842742">So far as I know and so far as any available record show, the Court Of Appeals has never look at the grand jury minutes, never passed on this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.441" offset="10329109">Now, what were the grounds on which Judge Holtzoff should have recused himself?</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.587" offset="10353768">The grounds were that in the hearing on the prior motion in referring to an episode which had occurred during the first trial, Judge Holtzoff said he remembered the episode very well where this man, Tompkins, had refused to testify at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.324" offset="10444675">He said he was just terrorized by Coppedge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.947" offset="10463169">And then he went on when there was call to his attention, Tompkins' statement that he had perjured himself before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.661" offset="10497964">Judge Holtzoff said he asserts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.861" offset="10506846">I imagine that statement was induced by Coppedge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.734" offset="10522311">Now, there wasn't anything in the record of the prior trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.630" offset="10537880">And there wasn't anything that ever occurred in the record of this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.411" offset="10553031">It would suggest or show that the recantation of Tompkins was induced by Coppedge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.255" offset="10592423">For the judge to have such a set conviction about the matter, before the trial began, put petitioner had a serious disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.108" offset="10631816">It put him before a judge who seem to have made up his mind on the truthfulness or lack of truthfulness appoints not yet induced an evidence, which might or might not be induced an evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.268" offset="10680404">He seem to have made up his mind that he would not accept any view petitioner might testify to in some of these advantages if petitioner should elect to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.133" offset="10739858">And we say that under these circumstances, Judge Holtzoff should have excused himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.109" offset="10767757">Now, the problem in the District of Columbia is not quite as severe as it might be in some districts where this only judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.547" offset="10797537">There are many judges all quite busy but there are many judges in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.751" offset="10818330">And when a problem of this kind arises, it is not a very difficult matter for a judge to pass the case on to another judge for assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.852" offset="10858768">Judge Holtzoff's basic misconception here, I think is disclosed in the part of the transcript quoted on 12 -- page 12 as my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.389" offset="10896906">Where -- when the question was raised, he said, “I don't think I have the choice in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.897" offset="10918954">It would be unethical for me to disqualify myself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.161" offset="10940061">As if he were -- would be doing something improper to take himself out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.820" offset="10974647">I think this really comes down to the heart of the matter on the disqualification point that Judge Holtzoff had such a narrow view of the duties and responsibilities and discretion of the judge in withdrawing from the case that he exercised whatever discretion he might have had as if there wasn't any discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.650" offset="11074017">He regarded their -- the situation as one in which no discretion existed in which even he was legally disqualified within the meaning of the statute covering affidavits or prejudice or else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.119" offset="11139845">He wasn't disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.362" offset="11144861">And he must sit because the case have been assigned to him surely isn't the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.000" offset="12187355">And petitioner's trial council made recently valued effort to persuade Judge Holtzoff not to admit the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.771" offset="12226435">And he offered many reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.968" offset="12239287">One was that there was a recantation statement filed this very witness saying giving a version of the event that exculpated instead of implicated petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.351" offset="12288815">And in view of that, he said the testimony was clearly unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.135" offset="12303862">Another wise that if now appeared from the kind of schizophrenia diagnosis that had been reported that this witness Artist now had schizophrenia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.083" offset="12351718">That was an illness started some time ago and very possibly affected by this even at the time of the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.741" offset="12382333">Another wise that during the course of the first trial, Judge Holtzoff had made some comments about this witness that went right to the unreliability point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.376" offset="12420890">He had -- he had himself told the jury something about Artist's unreliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.790" offset="12446490">And in addition to that, in a colloquy with counsel, which appears in the record at the first trial, he has said this prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.060" offset="12475643">Now, maybe I can save a lot of time in the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.354" offset="12488808">How much would you going to rely on Artist's testimony because I want to tell you right now that there isn't any judge who would send the man on the penitentiary on the basis of Artist's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.268" offset="12528410">That's in the record of the first trial so that there were surrounding this event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.142" offset="12551920">There were all the hallmarks of unreliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.129" offset="12567907">You have a problem of confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.558" offset="12581595">It is true that this Court has said and most Courts have said that the constitutional requirement of confrontation is met if in a second trial, the unavailable witnesses' testimony is brought forward and read provided he had testified as the witness at the first trial and there had been an opportunity to cross-examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.905" offset="12671039">There's nothing in the cases that I have been able to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.913" offset="12683055">It says that there is any absolute right on the part of the Government introduced this testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.896" offset="12706983">And I must say, I've never found a case that had so many hallmarks of unreliability detaching to the testimony as appeared in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.762" offset="12746376">Nevertheless, Judge Holtzoff, and here we come back again to this problem of absolutes versus discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.093" offset="12775737">Judge Holtzoff said, “I don't think I have any discretion in the matter.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3988.422" offset="16057031">The Government does indeed characterize these arguments as frivolous but it does not do so in any personal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.347" offset="16096737">We perhaps has do not need any personal slur on this opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.368" offset="16124844">We are simply using the term which this Court has itself imposed as the legal standard in the Ellis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.808" offset="16162565">I am pleased to note that my opponent does not slur me or the system that is invoked here because he does not accuse us upstanding path since the Ellis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.277" offset="16232469">He does not say that there has been no effect or no reaction as a result to the Ellis case but he does of course say is that there has been a change and in proceeds to argue to the effect that these changes meaningless or at least it does not handle the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.268" offset="16316479">I'm also pleased to note that he conceives that there is no simple solution to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.176" offset="16352110">The Courts in the District of Columbia, as the Courts everywhere -- Federal Courts do have this problem that was alluded to in the last few minutes that the statute passed by Congress is there and must be given difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.689" offset="16418147">And of course, the opinions of this Court must also be given difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.240" offset="16436328">And it place the court -- the Courts of the District of Columbia as the state from the other Federal Courts have their own special problem because of certain figures and statistics, which I hope to bring to your attention in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.618" offset="16497873">The Court of the District of Columbia has attempted to solve these problems as who made those attempts since the Ellis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.733" offset="16530265">And this system, if you want to call it that, I prefer it not call it system, this manner of handling cases is an honest attempt to handle this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.241" offset="16580315">And may it please Your Honors as counsel for the Government to some 10 years in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.282" offset="16612498">We had tried to make it work honestly not on the basis of an indigent si -- situation but also in non-indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.712" offset="16650219">We have attempted to make the calendar in the Court of Appeals a robust calendar because the non-indigent, the wealthy are attached by counsel for the appellee with motions to dismiss, with motions to affirm, with motions that the Court orders a given party to show cause why the rules of the Court have not been followed and in every instances in which Rule 75 of the Civil Rules requires a concise statement of the points which are being brought forward on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.076" offset="16791698">That concise statement is screened for the purpose of seeing if the issues to be raised by the appellant can be delineated so that a motion to affirm or dismiss can be formulated.</text>

            <text syncTime="4201.240" offset="16908309">The one in this case is consecutive and depend upon a prior sentence in another case and an assault of a dangerous weapon conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.339" offset="16944776">And in that prior case, he was sentenced to two to seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.586" offset="16961703">That seven years has not expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.290" offset="16972570">In the present case, he was sentenced to serve 20 months to 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.602" offset="16989811">And the combination, the way they are treated is that he has a minimum sentence of two years and 20 years -- 20 months as a minimum, almost three years is the minimum, and a maximum of 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.426" offset="17041115">He is now, at the moment, is eligible for parole.</text>
