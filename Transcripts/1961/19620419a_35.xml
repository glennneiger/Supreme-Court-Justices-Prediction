            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="9.696" offset="142190">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.201" offset="156191">At the close of the session yesterday, I was discussing the balancing theory which has been adopted by this Court in the Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson and other similar cases and was pointing to what I felt was a conflict between the doctrine that had been applied in these cases and the doctrine that had been applied or the results at least that had been reached in cases decided contemporaneously such as National Association for the Advancement of Colored People against Louisiana, Bates against Little Rock, Shelton against Tucker and a few others involving the integration of problem in the cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.520" offset="349497">May I with all due respect to this Court, suggest that perhaps the explanation of the Barenblatt line of decisions lies in the fact that the ideas and the speech in the assembly which was seeking protection in those cases were ideas, speech in assembly which we hate and which we abhor?</text>
            <text syncTime="92.177" offset="472064">Well, the ideas that were seeking protection and the assembly that was seeking protection invades Shelton, the Louisiana case and the others are ideas which today we find tolerable and in some cases even attractive.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.503" offset="545416">This of course is not a permissible application of the First Amendment to the Constitution if that amendment is to be given significant content.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.606" offset="585749">It is contrary to a long line of decisions running back to the days of Judge Brandeis and I'm not going to quote to Your Honors language which is very familiar to you from decisions by Judge Brandeis, by Judge Jackson, by Judge Black, in Richards against California and in many other cases and by Judge Holmes of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.675" offset="690030">All of them have pointed out that the primary purpose of the First Amendment is to give protection to the ideas that we abhor and that unless that it is given that interpretation, the Amendment has no a very significant meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.642" offset="777906">I don't have to overrule Barenblatt to succeed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.202" offset="792221">I think that I have, as I previously indicated, a reversible -- reversible error with respect to the question of the failure to grant an executive session.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.686" offset="838092">I believe further that I have reversible error and that the Court refused to admit the testimony of Professor Emerson on the balancing theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.792" offset="878529">And I believe further that within the bounds of Barenblatt and within the bounds of the balancing theory which is I said before, I am assuming although I cannot agree with it, that on balance in this case unlike what the Court felt was the situation in Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.425" offset="953031">On balance in this case, the balance lies on the side of the petitioner and on the side of the great First Amendment Rights which our for the protection of public discussion in the United States rather than on the other side of the scale which Your Honor has held in Barenblatt, must be weighed against the public and private interest on the other side.</text>

            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="265.534" offset="1165458">Oh I'm asking you to overrule Barenblatt but I haven't gotten to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.601" offset="1177788">I was just about to come to that point now.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.358" offset="1196805">As I said at the beginning, in its constitutional issues, I feel that this case is undistinguishable from Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.925" offset="1231078">And from now on, shall we say, I am asking the Court to overrule Barenblatt although I do not believe that anything I have said up to this point requires the overruling of Barenblatt but rather it requires an application of the balancing theory which will throw the balance in this case in the other way, and I'm not arguing what should have been -- how the balance should have been thrown in the other cases because those other cases are not here nor do I represent those other petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.820" offset="1358660">I would now like to turn to the constitutional issues which as I say call for a reversal of Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.094" offset="1387708">I have prepared an argument on this aspect of the case and I had intended to show first that the charter of the Committee Rule 11 was unconstitutionally vague and that it was improper to attempt to give it meaning by a search of legislative history at least in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.972" offset="1503274">However, proper that might be for historical or other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.768" offset="1522395">I had intended to argue further that since the Committee by its charter was limited to investigation of Un-American propaganda and even assuming that we could assign a meaning to that somewhat vague expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.166" offset="1584044">It would give the Committee the power to investigate speech because propaganda is merely another word for speech, and that that was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.969" offset="1623228">I had intended to argue that this particular hearing had nothing to do with propaganda anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.939" offset="1659173">And I had intended to argue further that this was a good case of exposure for exposure sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.118" offset="1687803">After preparing all of this argument with great diligence, I reread the dissenting opinion in the Barenblatt case and I found that everything that I had intended to say were said in that dissent or almost everything I have intended to say were said in that dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.133" offset="1771917">And for me to repeat all of the arguments that were made there and the decision that was handed down only I think two and a half years ago, what I think to be a -- in position on the Court, it would be merely repeating arguments and words which I have thought -- sure the Court is fully familiar with and I would not omit a word within if I have -- with permission of the author of the opinion, I would like to incorporate that dissent so as to speak by reference into this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.874" offset="1910888">If I may however, at the risk perhaps of "gilding the lily" add just a few words to what was said in that dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.101" offset="1951744">The dissent was written in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.262" offset="1968462">In the two and half years that have passed since that date, the process of the expansion and the growth of the seeds planted in ACA against Douds against which the dissent won in ACA against Douds and won again against in the Barenblatt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.541" offset="2057488">Those seeds have continued to expand and the doctrine of ACA against Douds has continued to apply further and further so that we have had since Barenblatt, the Braden case, the Wilkinson case in the specific area of congressional committees, the Scales case, Suppressive Activities Control Board case and perhaps four or five other decisions generally in the area of the rights of communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.932" offset="2191130">The second point I would like to make is addressed to the question of exposure for exposure sake which is also discussed in the Barenblatt decision and in other decisions as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.690" offset="2254137">I would like to note here the failure of the Committee to grant an executive session which I have already noted as an indication of the purpose of this Committee in seeking to call people before it for the purpose of exposing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.851" offset="2314742">In the course of the hearing Mr. Tavenner said he didn't interview the petitioner in advance to find out what his testimony would be because he didn't think the witness would cooperate, that's perhaps another way of saying that he didn't call -- he didn't subpoena the witness in advance because he didn't think the witness would testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.665" offset="2386004">And it doesn't seem to me that calling witnesses in a congressional investigation with the knowledge of understanding or belief that they aren't going to testify is the proper way to conduct the legislative investigation; the purpose of which is to get information and not to expose persons for their political belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.775" offset="2462490">In this case, the Committee had a great deal of information on the situation in Gary.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.945" offset="2483179">It had several so-called cooperative witnesses in Gary.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.397" offset="2500942">It called about ten other witnesses and as I have said before, it had engaged in nine previous investigations on this general subject and the only difference between this hearing and let us say, the hearing in Buffalo was that one hearing was in Buffalo and the other was in Gary.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.488" offset="2569279">But for legislative purposes, the fact adduced in both of those hearings was identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.510" offset="2597386">I would like to add just a few words, they're not in the record before this Court but they are matters, I believe of public record or most of them are, as to what happened after this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.767" offset="2642422">As I said before, the petitioner received the fourth foundation grant to study at the University of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.906" offset="2666977">When the appearance before the --</text>

          <turn speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="645.904" stopTime="788.926">
            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="645.904" offset="2687039">He was originally a graduate of the University of Colorado and he did -- is now doing graduate work at Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.797" offset="2710549">He received the fourth foundation grant of the University of Illinois and when this appearance before the congressional committee came to the attention of the faculty at Illinois, an investigation was held, the dean, after a great deal of campus activity on the subject and much distress to the petitioner, the dean after a faculty investigation, found that the petitioner had returned in good faith to the academic world.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.205" offset="2836146">Subsequently, he received a Nat -- National Science Foundation grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.498" offset="2853386">This came to the attention of Congressman Scherer, who made several speeches on the floor of Congress about how these persons who had refused to testify before the Committee had received government aid and as a result of those features, the National Science Foundation grant was revoked so that the Committee even after the hearing has been pursuing its exposure purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.755" offset="2962369">Finally, I would like to say one more thing and with this, I shall close.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.622" offset="3013883">The most important aspect of the First Amendment to the Constitution is I believe not the right of the petitioner to belong to the organization he wants to or to speak or to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.361" offset="3076786">The most important right is the right of the public to hear what he or whatever people may have to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.943" offset="3111163">And it is here that our democracy faces its greatest threat because today, while we have some degree of democratic discussion on high intellectual levels among people who are secure, there is no free in democratic discussion among the masses of the people on the great issues of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.387" offset="3216906">And this is largely because of fear.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.266" offset="3824410">Such a situation would have been serious enough 50 years ago but in the dynamic world of today, it poses a very serious threat to our existence as a free and democratic nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.723" offset="3882297">There is today a world wide debate going on, all over the world, Vietnam, in Argentina, Western Europe, Cuba, in Africa, a debate on the relative merits of two great opposing forces, two great social systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.638" offset="3957948">I suppose for a shorthand purposes, we can say the capital system of free enterprise and the socialist system of a planned and controlled society.</text>

            <text syncTime="1112.030" offset="4551450">Beginning with ACA against Douds, to Dennis, Barenblatt, Wilkinson, Braden, Scales, SACP and a scour of other cases, this Court has thrown its not uncon -- inconsiderable weight on what I feel is the wrong side, had it not done so, had it encouraged and supported the drive to political conformity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Terris</label>
            <text syncTime="1211.858" offset="4950810">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.057" offset="4963558">The start of my argument, I would like to state the Government's basic position and the most important issues in all three of the contempt of Congress cases which are being argued today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.574" offset="5005667">These basic issues are, first, whether the questions which were asked, the petitioners were in law of pertinent to the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.746" offset="5046314">Second basic issue is whether the petitioners were apprised of the pertinency of the questions which they were asked to the subject under inquiry at the time that they appear before the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.285" offset="5092498">The third basic question is whether the Committee's questioning of petitioners violated their rights under the First Amendment and the fours -- fourth basic question is whether the Committee's inquiry had a valid legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.015" offset="5147460">The Government submits that all four of these questions are squarely controlled by the recent decisions of this Court in the Barenblatt, Braden, and Wilkinson cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.625" offset="5189883">In fact, petitioners in their briefs and petitioner Yellin here in oral argument, seems to agree at least as to the controlling principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.805" offset="5226559">While petitioners indicate disagreement with those cases, they accept their applicability and argue that the particular facts of these cases, the cases which are now before the Court dictate a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.031" offset="5287476">And therefore, we submit that the issue which is before the Court, both as to pertinency and as to the First Amendment is whether the particular facts make these cases distinguishable from Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.839" offset="5346722">It's the Government's position that the cases which are now before the Court are substantially similar on their facts to Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson and insofar as the facts are different, that the cases which are now before the Court are considerably stronger for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.781" offset="5422477">I would now like to turn to this particular case, the Yellin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.676" offset="5442121">The Committee at the time the petitioner appeared before it was conducting an investigation of Communist activity in basic industry and particularly the steel industry in the Gary, Indiana area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.526" offset="5505442">The Committee had considerable information of a major effort of the Communist Party to colonize, that is to infiltrate basic industry throughout the United States and more specifically, to colonize the steel industry in the Gary, Indiana area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.460" offset="5585168">Petitioner Yellin was convicted for refusing to answer four questions, although he refused to answer considerable number more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.222" offset="5624247">The first question on which petitioner was convicted was where he resided prior to September, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.793" offset="5658520">The Committee explained that this question was designed to establish, the petitioner had lived in the Gary area and that therefore he would likely have knowledge of Communist activities in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.860" offset="5706794">The second question on which petitioner was convicted was whether he knew of Communist Party colonization in steel unions in the Gary area before 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.476" offset="5761233">The third question was whether petitioner was a member of the Communist Party on June 23rd, 1949, which was the date that he applied for employment at the steel mill in the Gary area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.626" offset="5817866">And the fourth question on which petitioner Yellin was convicted was whether there were Communist Party colonizers in the steel unions in Gary in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.460" offset="5865200">And therefore, all the questions on which petitioner was convicted involved with petitioner's own Communist Party activities or that -- or Communist Party activities generally in the steel industry in Gary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.620" offset="5929880">The petitioner here on my petitioner's prominent silver does not raise any issue as to pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.706" offset="5958196">He does not claim that the questions which he refused to answer were not in law of pertinent to the subject under inquiry nor does he claim that the Committee failed to apprise him of the pertinency of the questions to the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.434" offset="6021099">Petitioner Yellin's major contention is that the Committee's questioning of him violated his rights under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.672" offset="6062059">As petitioner admits his basic arguments that the Committee had no valid legislative purpose and that his First Amendment Rights were violated, were answered by this Court in Barenblatt, in Braden, and in Wilkinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.427" offset="6125066">However, petitioner says that his case is different because here, the private interest of the petitioner in silence outweighs the governmental interest of the Committee in compelling him to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.304" offset="6184626">This Court in the Barenblatt case emphasized the great, the overriding governmental interest in protecting the national security from go -- from Communist subversion and this determination did not standalone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.159" offset="6252022">It reflected of series of earlier decisions such as the Dennis case which upheld portions of the Smith Act, American Communications Association versus Douds which upheld the Non-Communist Oath Provision of the Taft-Hartley Act as well as numerous other cases in addition reflected the detailed findings of the Congress in Section 2 of the Subversive Activities Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.784" offset="6358497">In Barenblatt, this Court found that this obviously vital governmental interest in preventing subversion justified an investigation by the very same Committee which is involved in this case into Communist activities in educational institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.274" offset="6436446">And in Wilkinson and Braden, this Court held that the governmental interest in protecting against subversion justified this Committee in investigating Communist Propaganda Activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.869" offset="6486810">Comparing the situation which was before the Court, the situations which was -- were before the Court in Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson to this case, the governmental interest here is considerably stronger both education and propaganda are of course areas particularly protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.298" offset="6580537">Here on the other hand, the Committee's investigation was at -- was in the field of basic industry and particularly to steel industry which is certainly less directly protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.579" offset="6637693">In addition, while it was reasonable for Congress to believe that the danger from Communist subversion was substantial in education and propaganda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.818" offset="6682624">Certainly, the danger there was at less direct to the national security in Communist activity in basic industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.802" offset="6722539">In fact, it has been recognized for 40 years, as it is reflected in this Court's decision in American Communications Association versus Douds that one of the most important steps used by Communist to subvert democratic governments is to infiltrate and control labor within basic industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.509" offset="6813445">Certainly, the Congress could reasonably believe that such attempts by Communist in the United States presented a substantial danger which should be investigated at the least, and if found necessary, legislated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.324" offset="6888678">This Court in Barenblatt also pointed to three other considerations besides the danger of subversion in balancing the governmental and individual interest which were there at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.977" offset="6943326">First, the Court in Barenblatt noted that the Committee was not attempting to pillory Mr. Barenblatt and this is equally true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.806" offset="6978644">Committee made a considerable effort to persuade petitioner to testify and even explained the pertinency of the questions to him despite the fact that he made no specific objection on the grounds of lack of pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.461" offset="7037262">Second, this Court emphasized that Mr. Barenblatt had not been subpoenaed as a result of indiscriminate dragnet procedures, lacking in probable cause for belief that he possessed information which might be helpful to the subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.626" offset="7101837">And again, this is equally true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.440" offset="7113122">Two persons identified petitioner as a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.453" offset="7133184">These were live persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.666" offset="7137991">This did not come from the files of the Committee including Francis Crawley who identified petitioner as a fellow member of the Communist Party at the University of Michigan at the very same hearing that Francis Crawley similarly identified Mr. Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.817" offset="7210611">And finally, this Court in the Barenblatt case said that the relevancy of the questions is not open to doubt and this is even more clear in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.537" offset="7257527">Petitioner was repeatedly told that the Committee was investigating Communist activity and basic industry in the Gary, Indiana area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.564" offset="7409664">And finally, this Court said in the Barenblatt case, the relevancy of the question is not opened to the doubt and as I have said that this is equally true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.180" offset="7444041">Petitioner was told specifically of the subject under inquiry and the questions he refused to answer your concerned is on Communist Party activities or Communist Party activities in the steel industry in Gary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.985" offset="7503287">Petitioner, however, claims that this case is different from Barenblatt because the Committee had all the information on Communist activities which petitioner could possibly have supplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.833" offset="7550725">Petitioner contends that the Committee knew where Petitioner reside it before 1957 and that he was a member of the Communist Party in 1949 which was the question sought in the -- which was -- which was the information sought in the questions underlying counts one and three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.055" offset="7631600">And Petitioner further claims that the Committee knew from previous hearings concerning Communist activities and basic industry, the answers to the questions involved in Count 2 and 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.322" offset="7684681">Therefore, petitioner argues the Committee wanted only collab -- collaboration which does not outweigh the individual interest in silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.686" offset="7726164">The Government submits the petitioner's first mistake in this argument is a considering only the information which was sought from the particular questions on which petitioner was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.610" offset="7773811">The answer to anyone question or even any four questions, they will not be vitally important to the Committee's investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.899" offset="7811009">In order to determine the interest of the Government in disclosure, one must weigh the purpose of the entire investigation in the Communist activities in the steel industry and the possibility that the witness can contribute to this investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.313" offset="7872658">And therefore in the Barenblatt case, this Court weigh the Government's -- the Committee's interest in Communist infiltration and education, not the interest of the Government in obtaining the answers to the particular questions on which Mr. Barenblatt was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.662" offset="7946010">Petitioner's second mistake is in ignoring the important governmental interest and having a well-informed witness confirmed previous information particularly when the existing evidence is in a controversial area as this one certainly is, and is therefore likely to be challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.791" offset="8026572">The questions which this Court upheld in Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson, all sought information concerning whether the witness was a member of the Communist Party to collaborate evidence of the Committee already had in all three cases that the witness was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.522" offset="8113507">And in addition, it is clear that the Committee was not merely seeking in the questions involved in Counts 2 and 4 to confirm evidence that it already had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.652" offset="8161991">The previous Committee hearings concerning Communist activities in basic industry and more specifically in the steel industry concerned different although related subjects to the subject of Communist activities in the Gary area for those hearings all involved Communist activity and basic industry in other parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.822" offset="8262614">For example, the Buffalo hearings concerned Communist activity and basic industry in the Buffalo area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.644" offset="8289991">The Committee therefore could have a valid interest in seeing whether the pattern which was established in Buffalo also apply throughout the rest of the United States and that therefore, legislation might be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.614" offset="8345788">The record also shows that the Committee had little or no information of Communist Party activities in Gary after 1952 from other witnesses and did it hope to obtain this information from petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.210" offset="8404198">At the least, Petitioner has never shown that he could not have provided new information and certainly cannot unilaterally determine that he had no new information and that therefore, he need not testify before a properly authorized congressional Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.656" offset="8482043">Petitioner Yellin also claims that his case is different from Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson because here, the trial court excluded the proffered expert testimony of Professor Emerson on the issue whether petitioner's First Amendment rights had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.789" offset="8554559">This testimony is included in full in the record at pages 100 to 115 and was in response to the following question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.281" offset="8604505">Everyone opinion as to the various factual considerations which have to be taken into account in balancing the competing public and private interest at stake in the circumstances presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.697" offset="8662183">The trial court held that this question asked for an involved legal opinion and that Professor Emerson's answer constituted such a legal opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.186" offset="8704084">Without going into Professor Emerson's lengthy response in detail and then to summarize at pages 28 to 30 of our brief, we submit that the ruling of the trial court which was approved by the Court of Appeals was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.370" offset="8772838">The proper testimony consisted largely of legal factors which the Court should consider not with factual evidence relating to those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.676" offset="8818082">Professor's Emerson state -- Professor Emerson's statement in short reads by the closing argument of very able counsel summarizing his client's legal position under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.150" offset="8875969">In fact, Your Honor it does -- parts of itself considerably like Mr. Rabinowitz's closing remarks here today, while such statement it is of course proper when presented by counsel is legal argument, the lower courts will correct and it did not constitute evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.523" offset="8953501">But even if we are wrong and the lower courts are wrong and Professor Emerson's testimony was properly admissible, we submit petitioner's conviction and nevertheless should not be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2307.002" offset="9331336">I don't think that's the same type of issue which was involved in the obscenity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.930" offset="9355055">But even if there was admissible, the Government's further argument is this -- that petitioner Yellin's contention should anyway be sustained but the testimony was offered solely concerning petitioner Yellin's claims under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.729" offset="9414301">And this was a legal issue which this Court in Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson decided for itself and therefore, this Court itself consider Professor Emerson's statement which is fully set fort in the record to determine if petitioner Yellin's First Amendment rights were actually violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.393" offset="9496952">And if we so consider Professor Emerson's statement, a fair summary is that a danger of -- that the danger from the Communist overthrow of the United States Government is not substantial but the threat to First Amendment rights from congressional inquiries in the Communist activities is extremely serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.876" offset="9574902">We submit that this statement adds nothing to the competing considerations waived by this Court in Barenblatt, in Dennis and American Communication Association versus Douds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.395" offset="9616906">And therefore, we submit that Professor's -- Professor Emerson's statement presented no basis for changing this Court's determination in the earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.890" offset="9654941">The congressional committees can compel witnesses to testify concerning communist activities without violating the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.707" offset="10146252">Your Honor, the way the Government sees the relationship between Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson on the one hand and any city in Alabama, Shelton and Tucker, Bates and Little Rock and the other which all involved the balancing testing, came out different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.263" offset="10212394">Is that Court held in Barenblatt that there was great danger from subversion from communism?</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.203" offset="10232142">And the questions as the communism could be asked because of the overwriting governmental interest in that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.920" offset="10259101">On the other hand, an N.A.A.C.P.in Alabama, in Bates and Little Rock, this Court that found there was no interest of the State in finding out the membership list of the -- of the N.A.A.C.P.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.530" offset="10313540">And in Shelton and Tucker, this Court found that there wasn't -- there wasn't sufficiency in -- sufficient interest to find out the membership of teachers in all their organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.970" offset="10359202">Now, it's interesting in Shelton and Tucker, this Court carefully said that it was not deciding that a State couldn't ask questions of teachers concerning their membership in certain organizations or they could -- that the State was not precluded from asking from certain teachers their membership in all organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.850" offset="10438823">Now, if -- the Government submits that what these cases altogether show is that when the -- when a Committee, when the State or Federal Government is investigating something is serious, is Communist subversion that the governmental interest outweighs the private interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.482" offset="10505279">Now, if the question that was asked was so clearly on its face unrelated to anything to do with Communist activity, I suppose that there would be unconstitutional to ask the question, although it probably also not be pertinent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2676.961" offset="10811225">This Court in Barenblatt's gave three considerations which have to be applied in each individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.686" offset="10834108">One of the considerations was whether the witness was called as a result of dragging and procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.785" offset="10854484">I've arg -- well, I assumed that there's no absolutely no basis that can believe it he has any information about the subject under inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2699.081" offset="10899728">Well I -- I think that is the meaning of what -- of what this Court said in the Barenblatt case and is repeated substantially in those terms in both Braden -- both Braden and Wilkinson that Mr. Barenblatt was not subpoenaed as the result of it and, “Indiscriminate dragnet procedures lacking and probable cause for belief that he possess information which might be helpful to the subcommittee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.596" offset="11001710">Now, applying that standard, if a witness was just called off the street, they had no -- no indication that he had any information about Communist activity in the particular Communist activity which the Committee was investigating then I think this would probably violate the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.767" offset="11078405">Now, the two other considerations which are in Barenblatt; one is that whether the Committee was attempting to pillory the witness and another one was whether the questions were relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.393" offset="11116962">Now, I've argued that it -- in this case as in the other two cases, all three of these standards are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.463" offset="11141204">And then I -- the Government submits that if they are met then as Your Honor suggesting this question that Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson establish that the Committee can compel a witness to answer questions which are pertinent.</text>

            <text syncTime="4598.247" offset="18496345">Now, there's also some confusion on the record about whether they would have interviewed him if he had been in Gary.</text>

            <text syncTime="4619.697" offset="18582131">He claims that they were too vague to support his indictment and therefore too vague to support his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.268" offset="18608462">Now, of course the first and conclusive answer is this goes only two counts even if he's right on it, the other two counts are valid and that -- since there was an concurrent sentence, the conviction would have to be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.563" offset="18657573">The second answer is that he did not raise this issue in his petition for certiorari and therefore, this would be for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.640" offset="18681919">And the third answer is that his contention on his merits without substance, as far as I know no -- no indictment under the contempt of Congress statute has ever explained the meaning if the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.422" offset="18737089">The only two questions which are -- there is any doubt -- the only two words that there's any doubt about it, the words colonization and colonizer and it's very difficult to understand how petitioner could have been confused about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.603" offset="18789752">Admittedly, they've -- they are some -- there are words of art that petitioner admits that he was present during the lengthy testimony of the previous witness in which he went into detail what these questions and what these words meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.382" offset="18844923">And in fact, the previous witness specifically defined the word colonize and the petitioner was in any doubt at his trial and/or petitioner's counsel, all he would have had to do is read the transcript of the hearings and he would -- have certain be fully satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.827" offset="18910647">However, petitioner argues that this isn't enough that has to be in the indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4734.398" offset="19040946">What they did is they sent college graduates or at least people in college who had a considerable amount of training in the basic industries, steel, transportation and textile mills, automobiles and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.257" offset="19088384">These people concealed the fact that they had excellent educations from the workers in order so that they would attain a position of importance in the labor movement and would be able to influence them which of course, they would have trouble doing if they've told that they were members -- they had good educations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.193" offset="19164139">In fact, they might not even get a job because companies of course would be suspicious that people who want to become permanently not just for summer job, steel workers on -- on the regular line right at the -- right at the furnace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.970" offset="19227251">So they can -- now, this is exactly what happened to petitioner Yellin and that's what the Committee had evidence of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.576" offset="19249716">His application for employment in 1949 in the Carnegie Illinois Steel Company in Gary, did not disclose that he had been to New York -- City College of New York and the University of Michigan and had -- and had virtually an AA average and so that -- that's precisely the subject that the Committee was interested in.</text>

            <text syncTime="4812.124" offset="19351907">I would like first to go into this executive session thing because I think the facts can be cleared up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.781" offset="19390464">Mr. Walter testified that at some time, presumably at the time the subpoenas were issued, although that is not altogether clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.944" offset="19431111">The Committee had decided that it would call Mr. Yellin in executive session, I mean in public session.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.414" offset="19460995">And the reason he said was that this man was a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.925" offset="19483042">He had deceived his employer and that they thought they had -- they had a lot of information about him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.548" offset="19509582">Now of course, the rule does not list these reasons as reasons for an executive session.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.262" offset="19540407">The rule says that an executive session shall be called when it will result in unjust publicity so that apparently in making the original determination to call Mr. Yellin and 15 other people I suppose in public rather than an executive session, whatever the reasons where they had nothing to do with the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.166" offset="19628074">The standard used by the Committee or by Mr. Walter in making this determination was tended that I'm not included in the rule at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="4926.511" offset="19809468">It's in my record, in my brief rather at page 5, the -- the copy in the record is -- is very bad reproduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.971" offset="19855235">Testimony needed for legislative purpose can be secured in executive session without exposing witnesses to publicity.</text>

            <text syncTime="5229.192" offset="21020191">The rule of practices that counsel shouldn't talk to the Committee but should only talk to his witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.859" offset="21046836">Anytime counsel attempts to address the Committee at any of these hearings, the general rule is except to stating his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.380" offset="21076929">The general rule is -- well, it varies -- well, it depends on whether Mr. Walter is conducting a hearing in which case the rules are very strict, though Mr. Doyle was conducting a hearings in which case the rules are pretty liberal, Mr. Doyle being less a impatient man.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.746" offset="21134399">But generally speaking, the rule is that counsel is not supposed to talk to the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.520" offset="21153416">He is supposed to talk only to his witness, to his client and that of course is a whispered conversation that takes place at the witness table.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.603" offset="21185808">Generally speaking, arguments of law and so forth and so on are supposed to be made, objections to the jurisdiction of a Committee at least of the privilege and so forth and so on, are made by the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.680" offset="21238053">What frequently happened, I supposed always happens in practice at least it does may have had before the Committee is that counsel reviews this with the Committee, with the witness if the witness is good enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.823" offset="21290715">He recites what has been told or what he believes ought to be said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.170" offset="21312031">If not, he reads the statement which he and counsel have worked out in advanced and the situation varies in a great deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.160" offset="21336064">In Mr. Yellin's case, you can tell by reading the transcript, he spoke off the cop.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.638" offset="21361873">He wasn't thrown up constantly and he argued with the Committee as to the lack of jurisdiction and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.573" offset="21385697">In -- as we will see in the Silver case, Mr. Silver said, “I want to incorporate by reference everything that the previous witness said because the previous witness had read a long statement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.314" offset="21432613">And the practice in this respect varies but one thing does not vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.556" offset="21445569">Counsel can't do anything talking, that's clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.953" offset="21467199">Now, after these telegrams were read, the witness proceeded to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.505" offset="21493426">Now, counsel, one the Government is mistaken in one respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.198" offset="21504188">He stated not once but three or four times that by the time Mr. Yellin testified there, it was already a testimony before the Committee that he was a Communist.</text>

            <text syncTime="5360.242" offset="21544312">The first witness who testified was Mr. Lautner who never heard of Mr. Yellin or at least gave no indication that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.621" offset="21569808">Mr. Yellin was the second witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5369.027" offset="21579525">There were subsequent witnesses who identified Mr. Yellin that having once been a Communist, but this was after Mr. Yellin testified and not before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.766" offset="21630412">Counsel says both parties were at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.560" offset="21649638">I suppose that the witness was at fault because he didn't send the telegram quickly enough, at least that's the only clue that I can think of.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.208" offset="21680253">Well, the witness was in Denver, I was in New York, the hearing was in Gary, the Committee was in Washington and it isn't easy to make full connection quickly under those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="5503.249" offset="22116394">Now, Mr. Arens, title was Staff Director and later had developed and Mr. Walter said, he never had any authority to reject this and this was all the misunderstanding of the kind, and as -- as has been pointed out the -- Mr. Walter said that at one point -- Mr. Walter said, "If you had sent the telegram to me or perhaps we wouldn't be here."</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.877" offset="22226840">Now one -- one that appearing at page -- record -- record page 69 he said, “I am sure this could not have happened, had you addressed your telegram to me?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.533" offset="22277517">And at record page 70 he said, if he had known of the request for an executive sessions so that the Committee could have given the due consideration, we might have a different situation today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.528" offset="22325478">Now, maybe it was a little bit of the fault of the Committee but I'm willing to excuse both faults.</text>

            <text syncTime="5592.034" offset="22471555">Yes, and the question is whether his rights were violated in connection with this request for an executive session, and this is so far as our present discussion is concerned, the reason for reversal that I am pressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.175" offset="22524113">Now, I would like to get on to the balancing question and here I am very grateful to counsel for the Government because I have heard here for the first time what I assume is the authoritative government view out of what the balancing rule means.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.136" offset="22587956">Express -- I must confess much more clearly than this Court has ever expressed it, and I think it's a clear view.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.505" offset="22625364">I think it -- it's easy to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.313" offset="22640619">I think it destroys much of the First Amendment and I don't believe that the Court ought to accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5640.289" offset="22664547">As I understand the situation, the Court has decided that for the present according to counsel, the public interest in this kind of investigation is overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="5653.271" offset="22716479">Now, I don't know for -- how long for the present exists and I don't know when it is that I get an opportunity to show that the present has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.067" offset="22755662">Now, the Court decided in Barenblatt on the basis but no evidence in the record at all incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.922" offset="22775097">I assume the Court did it by taking judicial notice of the threat of Communist subversion, that as of that day, the threat of Communist Subversion was so great that the Congress had this -- this overpowering.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.546" offset="22841553">I forgot the word that counsel used but it was a very strong one overwriting I think interest in -- in this investigation, overwriting government interest was the word he used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.755" offset="22886379">But when does it change?</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.724" offset="22890245">When do I get an opportunity to show that this situation is no longer overwriting?</text>
            <text syncTime="5701.119" offset="22907800">That fact is that we do live in a dynamic world, things do change.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.022" offset="22919502">I tried to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.464" offset="22925249">I tried to do through Professor Emerson's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.104" offset="22939773">What did he say?</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.018" offset="22947401">Well, he said he doesn't think there's much threat and he went into reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.774" offset="22966418">He said there's very little communism for once in the trade-union movement today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5719.773" offset="22982510">He said that in the academic world as far as he knows, there's practically no communist influenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.294" offset="23004557">He said that most communist have been driven out of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.515" offset="23017409">He said that we have no social unrest in the United States to speak off or that the social unrest that does exist which is mostly in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="5736.786" offset="23050533">It does not seem to be leaning in the direction of communism that the Negroes have taken other methods of securing redress of their rights and that there appears to be no rebirth or -- or strengthening of communism in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.119" offset="23111868">He said he find no significant opposition by way of another political party to the major political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.015" offset="23139453">He said that in his opinion the strength of the Communist Party was very small as a result of the laws that it did pass what she detailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.573" offset="23169651">He found that there was very little religious and religious institutions very little Communist strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.316" offset="23200684">And, the situation we believe has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5777.277" offset="23212492">When do we get a chance to show that the thing has change?</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.392" offset="23224926">Now, just one word more, on the other side namely the right of the individual, his side of the scale as I understand the Government's position, the only right that the individual has is that the Committee should be nice to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.142" offset="23287933">No talk about free speech, no talk about the assembly, no talk about free press, no talk about the right to express his views, he just is entitled to be treated as a gentlemen and not pillorying.</text>
            <text syncTime="5810.136" offset="23343940">Well, I think this is reducing the First Amendment to rather small (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5815.874" offset="23366823">Thank you.</text>
