            <label>Mr. Tobias Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="46.072" offset="287640">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.727" offset="306239">This is an appeal from the final decision of the Supreme Court of Florida, upholding the validity of Fla. Stat. 876.05 against the contention that this statute violated the provisions of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.870" offset="390875">This is the Act which requires that all public employees in the State of Florida, including David Walton Cramp, who is a teacher, execute a loyalty or expurgatory oath as a condition of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.630" offset="465899">The pertinent provisions of that oath other than the ones that were in effect prior to 1949 which at that time simply required all public employees to swear loyalty to the Constitution and to the -- and to the United States, now require that the public employee swear that he is not a member of the Communist Party and I quote, “That I have not and will not lend my aid, support, advice, counsel or influence to the Communist Party; that I do not believe in the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of Florida by force or violence; and fourth, that I am not a member of any organization or party which believes in or teaches directly or indirectly the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="154.125" offset="719914">Now, the appellant, Cramp, had been employed in Orange County as a teacher for nine years when just prior to the institution of this litigation, it was realized that through some administrative oversight, he had not executed the loyalty oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.648" offset="793997">He was approached and requested to sign the oath.</text>

            <label>Mr. Tobias Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="183.502" offset="837360">Yes, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.905" offset="850944">Cramp refused to sign the oath on the grounds that the State could not validly and constitutionally require that he execute this oath as a condition of his employment and for no other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.482" offset="921266">He brought an action in Orange County under Florida statutes for declaratory relief to declare the statute invalid and to assert his continuing right to teach school without the necessity of executing this oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.854" offset="986781">This relief was denied to him by the Circuit Court and this decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Florida and this appeal then followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.190" offset="1040175">I would like to state that the issue before this Court as I understand it is not whether or not Florida is to be required to keep communists in its roles of public employees nor is the question so ably put by my Brother that Florida cannot establish reasonable qualifications for its teaching personnel or other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.622" offset="1153860">Because however, there is always and this Court has always recognized the duty of a State with regard to its public employees to establish only and stipulate only those qualifications which are reasonable and which are reasonably designed to fit the man to the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.080" offset="1243721">Because of that requirement, we state that the issue before this Court is whether or not the qualifications imposed by Florida are reasonable and whether they bear a reasonable relationship to the position itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.335" offset="1316760">Irrespective, I wish to point out at this point in the argument whether these qualifications were imposed through the procedural device or vehicle of the loyalty oath or whether they were imposed by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.892" offset="1382902">I think there is no issue about the fact that a state cannot impose qualifications for employment which violate due process, equal protection and this Court has unanimously stated on many occasions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.780" offset="8626448">We further maintain that because these qualifications are embodied in a loyalty oath which is presented to some 40,000 public school teachers and many more times that number of public employees within the State of Florida, that the requirement of the loyalty oath itself as a procedural device is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.195" offset="8764165">Now, the reason why we maintain that position is because the requirement that a man execute and oath as distinguished from complying with certain qualifications, imposes upon him the necessity of submitting his associations, his beliefs, his concepts to the State in order for him to secure a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.273" offset="8868446">Unquestionably, the execution of a loyalty oath is a restriction upon the privileges and rights of association, thought and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2247.221" offset="9092263">But this, I believe, runs afoul of the concept that was established or utilized in Shelton versus Tucker where this Court stated that where there are alternative means of acquiring information, where there are alternative means of achieving an end desired by the State, a second balance must be struck if one method utilizes less danger and less harm or establishes less harm for the individual's rights then that is the method which must be chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.040" offset="9279509">Now, we submit that to -- that to turnover to the entire body of public employees in the State of Florida, an oath requiring that they give their associational ties and an expression of their beliefs and concepts even if for example, this Court were to say that they could have this information in the first place, that this is not the proper method of achieving this, that this has a chilling effect upon their rights, upon their associational rights as guaranteed under the First Amendment and this Court I believe has prescribed and has shown the method that can be utilized to prescribe these qualifications and that is the matter of the employer-employee investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="6798.688" offset="27298147">All your Supreme Court had said was this, “By the allegations of his complaint, the appellant under oath affirmatively denied any present or past associations which would preclude him from executing the subject oath.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6817.355" offset="27372753">He stated in his complaint quote, “That he has not, does not and will not lend aid, support or advice, counsel or influence the Communist Party.”</text>

            <text syncTime="7230.386" offset="29024946">They said the same thing that this statute could not constitute an ex post facto law as to this appellant but they did not say that this appellant was not permitted to raise the due process question and they did not say that this appellant -- of course they said that there was no denial of due process, but they ruled on that and they did not answer the other questions on this ground which if they have wanted to, they could have dismissed our entire brief and our entire complaint raising six assignments of error on this last one and they did not do it for the simple reason that the Florida Supreme Court did not hold that there was no standing to sue.</text>
