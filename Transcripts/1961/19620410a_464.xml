            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="27.094" offset="211780">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.978" offset="223274">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.519" offset="253471">The Labor Board found in this case that the respondent company violated the National Labor Relations Act by discharging seven employees who had concertedly walked out of the plant in protest against inadequate heating of the machine shop in which they were employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.094" offset="331734">The Board's order requires the respondent company to offer reinstatement of these employees with back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.661" offset="358066">The court below set aside the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.611" offset="373844">It concluded that the walkout, the concerted walkout was not concerted activity within the protection of the statute and that therefore, the discharge does not violate of the Act because the employees, prior to the walkout, had failed to make a demand upon the employer to correct the objectionable conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.638" offset="465899">The question presented is whether in the circumstances of this case, there is award in the statute for the interposition of such a condition precedent to the employees' exercise of their right to engage in concerted activity for mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.849" offset="538728">I shall briefly summarize the basic facts which give rise to this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.058" offset="563597">The respondent company operates a plant in Baltimore, Maryland where it is engaged in the fabrication of aluminum products.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.785" offset="598497">And in connection with this plant, it operates a machine shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.102" offset="615737">The day shift on the machine -- on the machine shop consists of a foreman and eight employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.019" offset="639457">And at the time of the events that gave rise to this controversy, these employees were not represented by a union nor was there in effect any collective bargaining agreement which provided for machinery for the handling of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.656" offset="697971">The shop is approximately 40 x 75 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.648" offset="717928">It is not insulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.779" offset="726497">It has a number of doors which open to the outside and during working time, these doors are open by frequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.517" offset="753455">The shop is principally heated -- principally heated by large gas furnace and to -- by a large oil furnace rather, by large oil furnace and two much smaller gas furnaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.225" offset="808312">Sometime prior to the walkout here in question, the employees complained about the coldness of the shop in the winter time.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.518" offset="841435">On January 5th, 1959, a Monday morning, the employees of the machine shop reported at the plant some time between 7 and 7:30.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.024" offset="891486">That particular morning was extremely cold and for Baltimore, an abnormally cold day, cold morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.391" offset="920952">An anticipation of the heat, the night watchmen had been at the plant at 1 o'clock that morning -- 1 o'clock Monday morning, and again at 5 o'clock that morning and had sought to start the furnaces, but he was unable to start the large furnace, and the large furnace is the one that is the source of -- the primary source of heat for the machine shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.852" offset="1006738">When the employees reported at work, as I say between 7 and 7:30, they found the shop extremely cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.804" offset="1034637">And one of the employees, Caron, went into the foreman Jarvis' office in order to get warmed but found that his office was just as cold as the rest of the shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.833" offset="1078732">While he and foreman Jarvis were discussing the cold in the shop, foreman Jarvis saw a couple of employees, as the record puts it, all huddled up near the doorway, and Jarvis remarked to Caron, "If those fellow had any guts, they would go home."</text>
            <text syncTime="262.973" offset="1155218">Caron reported this statement to his fellow employees and they discussed it among themselves, and they decided to go home.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.164" offset="1188028">There's one employee who testified and answered the question, "Why did you leave the plant on Monday morning with these other men?"</text>
            <text syncTime="277.121" offset="1211852">I'm reading it -- at the bottom of page 43 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.035" offset="1223555">His answer was, "Well, they said it was extremely cold, and we had all got together and thought it would be a good idea to go home.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.524" offset="1253439">Maybe we could get some heat brought into the plant that way."</text>
            <text syncTime="292.541" offset="1273501">Now, seven of the eight employees, as I say, had decided to go home, and as they were leaving, Jarvis and perhaps one or two of the employees, or rather Caron.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.622" offset="1325850">As they were leaving, Caron, one of the employees remarked to foreman Jarvis that they were going home, they were leaving, it was too cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.047" offset="1363571">They walked out at approximately the time that the 7:30 whistle which blew the -- which marked the -- the start of working day, the time that whistle blew.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.452" offset="1401187">Only one of the eight employees decided to remain and apparently the record suggest that he was an alien and feared that because he was an alien, he might have difficulty obtaining other employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.447" offset="1445177">Meanwhile -- meanwhile, the company's electrician had fixed the furnace, probably some switch there hadn't been put on.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.172" offset="1480077">He fixed the furnace and within a few minutes after 7:30, the furnace was operating but the temperature in this machine shop did not reach normal until nearly noon at that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.297" offset="1528560">About an hour later after the men had walked out of the plant, the company's president appeared at the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.653" offset="1553951">And when he discovered what had happened, he ordered the seven men to be discharged because he said, "They had left without permission."</text>
            <text syncTime="372.367" offset="1592822">Notice was given to the very -- to the seven men, either by telephone or by telegram, that particular day that they were discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.024" offset="1627512">In a very short time of the decision to discharge them, one of the employees came back and apparently indicated that he was prepared to go back to work but the company said, "No, that they won't take him back."</text>
            <text syncTime="393.268" offset="1676413">And on the next day or two, one or two other employees also indicated the desire to return to work but again the company refused to reconsider its decision.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="401.120" offset="1707865">Mr. Manoli, the discharges were the same day, did you say?</text>

          <turn speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="404.022" stopTime="404.513">
            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="404.022" offset="1719463">Yes sir.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="404.513" stopTime="406.119">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="404.513" offset="1721448">Same day as the walkout.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="406.119" stopTime="558.435">
            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="406.119" offset="1727822">Yes, the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.331" offset="1732733">That's right and all of the parties were notified on the day of the walkout.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.317" offset="1744645">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.985" offset="1755303">Now, as I said, the court below disagreeing with the Board concluded that this walkout, this concerted stoppage of work by these employees was not concerted activity within the protection of the statute because these employees had failed prior to the walkout to make a demand upon the employer to correct the objectionable conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.622" offset="1849866">The court below did not set aside the Board's additional findings that these people had complained about the coldness of the shop in the winter time sometime before the walkout.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.320" offset="1892603">But it is kind of these complaints on the ground that these complaints had not been coupled with a specific demand that the employer do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.016" offset="1931473">Now, in our judgment and the Board's judgment, we believe that neither the basic -- neither the specific provisions of the statute nor its basic policies warrant the imposition in the circumstances of this case of such a condition present to the employer's exercise of their Section 7 rights, namely, the right to engage in concerted activities for mutual aid and protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.030" offset="2031470">Now, the starting point of our analysis, I think is Section 7 of the Act and Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="490.073" offset="2063653">Section 7 of the Act provides that the employer shall have the right to engage in collective bar -- to engage in concerted activities for purposes of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.510" offset="2117360">Section 8 (a) (1) makes an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with, coerce or restrain employees in the exercise of their Section 7 right.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.647" offset="2161977">Now, I think there can be very little question that the walkout in this case certainly satisfies the literal language of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.544" offset="2197504">It was the concerted action of seven employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.848" offset="2210774">It wasn't protest against objectionable working conditions and hence for their mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.303" offset="2236583">And I venture to say -- I venture to say that the walkout here is the most elementary form of concerted activity for mutual aid and protection and that the walkout here represents nothing more than a simple exercise of the employee's right to engage in a concerted stoppage of work for the purpose of objecting to a -- to conditions of work that they don't want or like.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.244" offset="2332400">And it would seem to follow --</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="558.435" stopTime="560.702">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="558.435" offset="2337102">Was there a collective bargaining agreement --</text>

          <turn speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="560.702" stopTime="561.212">

            <text syncTime="562.504" offset="2353403">No sir, there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.390" offset="2356955">They were not represented either by union and there was no collective bargaining agreement in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.948" offset="2379212">It would seem to follow that the employer's discharge in this case is the plaintiff sort of interference and restraint of employees in the exercise of Section 7 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.646" offset="2417977">Now, I am aware, I'm aware if the Court please that the courts, both the Board and the courts have held that not all conduct, not all the employees self-helped which falls within the literal scope of Section 7, necessarily enjoys its protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.249" offset="2488404">Both the Board and the courts have held at that Section and that be read literally so as to minimize all conduct which falls within its literal scope without regard either that means or the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.843" offset="2538768">Both the Board and the courts including this one, have held that concerted activity may lose the protection of the statute where either -- either where its object is in contravention of a specific provision of the statute, our statute, or its basic policy, or the provisions of some related federal statute or -- or whether means used, even though for a lawful act are so egregiously incompatible with the recognized standards of conduct in employer-employee relationships as to be deemed indefensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.527" offset="2685471">Now, I submit Your Honors that this case does not fall within any of those categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.150" offset="2712012">The court below sought to anchor its decision in this case here upon the policy of the statute which fosters the peaceful resolution of industrial disputes through collective bargaining and through negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.388" offset="2760913">And the court felt here that the failure of the employees to go through the formality of making a prior demand upon the employer before they walked out was in derogation of this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.042" offset="2807515">Now, of course it's true that if employers make a prior demand upon the employer to correct objection of the conditions, it may be conducive to the peaceful resolution of that dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.123" offset="2863835">But to say as the court below apparently thought, to say that there's an inconsistency between strike action, concerted work stoppages and the statutory policy of fostering the peaceful resolution of industrial disputes by negotiation and for -- because the employers have not gone through the formality of making a prior demand, I submit that Your Honor, that to say that, to say that there's an inconsistency between the two is to misconceive, is to misconceive the place of strike action and work stoppages in the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.770" offset="2990477">As this Court said in the Insurance Agent's case, the right to engage in work stoppages for mutual aid or protection, the right to engage into strikes was not a grudging exception to the statutory policy of fostering the peaceful resolution of industrial disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.038" offset="3055574">It was part impartial of it as indicated by Section 7, by Section 8 (a) (1) and Section 8 -- and Section 13 of the statute which in some brought in to protect the right of the employers to engage in concerted activities, and immunize the right to strike except as specifically provided otherwise in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.617" offset="3137808">Congress has seen no inconsistency between work stoppage or strike action and the policy of the statute of the peaceful resolution of disputes, just because the employers had not made a prior demand and there is no provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="850.683" offset="3506134">I say we have nothing like that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.062" offset="3515643">Now, it may well be -- it may well be, there will be that spontaneous work stoppage such as in this case, may be the most effective method that the employers have at hand for compelling the employer to alleviate objectionable working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.755" offset="3570395">And again, as this Court noted in the Insurance Agents, the fact that peaceful self-help by employees maximizes the pressure upon the employer to do something about it, about the conditions that they are objecting to does not necessarily make those self -- does not make those self-help activities run it counter to the statutory policy of collective bargaining or a fostering the peaceful resolution of industrial disputes by negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.795" offset="3670601">Now, there may be situations -- there may be situations where the broad Section 7 rights may have to be accommodated to some legitimate employer interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.204" offset="3728175">For example, both the Board and the courts have held that where you have a spontaneous workout -- a spontaneous walkout which may create a hazardous condition of the plant or may endanger its safety that the employees may lose the protection of the statute under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.583" offset="3797661">Or you may have a situation like the Third Circuit had in Condenser, a number of years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.014" offset="3815424">Number of years ago where the employer had promised the employees that he would hear them -- hear their grievance at the end of the working day and they acquiesce in this but subsequently then just walked out of the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.279" offset="3860459">Here, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit said, "Well, they had given an implied promise that they would wait until they had -- or would hear them as he had promised to do it."</text>
            <text syncTime="948.606" offset="3897762">But we have nothing like that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.137" offset="3911868">There was no collective bargaining agreement to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.980" offset="3923257">There was no promise to hear these people, there was no union involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.162" offset="3944051">The employees had made -- they hadn't be -- made complaints, they hadn't made complaints about the coldness of the plant some time prior to the particular walkout here while the court below discounted these complaints on the -- on the ground that they were not coupled with specific demand that the employer do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.678" offset="4010088">I suggest that that view is rather hyper technical.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.550" offset="4021582">When the employers appeared at the plant on this morning, the condition there were intolerable and was the most natural thing on the -- on earth for them just think that work was out of the question and for them to go home.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.195" offset="4076126">Now, the employer, at all times, knew why the employees had walked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.005" offset="4099427">He'd knew why they had walked out, when he discharged them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.203" offset="4112175">It knew what it had to do in order to bring them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.943" offset="4123146">It could've notified them that the furnace was in operation and that the plant would be heated -- would be -- would be heated up, normal temperatures by noon, but instead, what did it do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.880" offset="4162853">It summarily fired them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.650" offset="4173928">Now, we are told -- we are told that the walkout here interrupted critical production of this -- all that we're -- the evidence, the right of testimony in the record is that there was some one item that was supposed to go out, it's an unspecified item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.159" offset="4244041">The testimony is it was supposed to go out that day, and the other thing was that two people were taken from some other jobs and put in the machine shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.590" offset="4277687">Now, I venture to suggest Your Honors, that whatever disruption there was here for production at best, at best was no more than what it would be incidental of any strike or work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.538" offset="4329514">Now, weighing these factors -- weighing these factors, the Board concluded -- the Board concluded that the failure of the employer, the omission of the employees to make it -- close with the formality of making a prior demand upon the employer to correct the objection or conditions was insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.985" offset="4403284">It was insufficient in the circumstance of this case to award a forfeiture of the right to which otherwise entitle to under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.303" offset="4440586">This Court has said that where an accommodation must be made, must be made between competing interest within the statutory framework but the primary responsibility for making these accommodations is -- lies with the Board, and that the court should respect that kind of an accommodation unless it's unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.900" offset="4527000">We think that the court below lost sight of this principle when it upset the Board's judgment of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.446" offset="4553122">Basically, it seems to me, the court below has made its decision with respect to the legality of the walkout here, turn upon its notion that there was something unfair about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.873" offset="4606830">Something unfair about it because the failure of the furnace to work, the mechanical failure of -- of furnace to work was of something of opportunity and that the furnace was in operation within a few minutes after the employees had walked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.590" offset="4673703">But both the Board and the courts I think properly so had been weary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.911" offset="4695019">They've been weary of conditioning the exercise of Section 7 rights upon their individual notions as to what is wise or fair or proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.035" offset="4735561">Indeed, as long it goes 1938, this Court said in the Mackay case that the wisdom or unwisdom, the justification or the lack of justification of the employees may have in engaging in concerted activity is normally irrelevant to the question of illegality of that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.732" offset="4806301">And to hold otherwise, to hold otherwise would present the very serious danger of resurrecting the discredited common law of conspiracy doctrine under which such is decided whether act -- concerted action by employees was legal or not legal under basis -- their own individual views as to what was fair, desirable or wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.662" offset="4889997">This philosophy, we believe runs counter to the philosophy of the federal labor policy as reflected not only in the Norris-LaGuardia statute but in our statute as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.394" offset="4928972">Of course, the court below -- the court below was not so unmindful of history as to phrase this decision in terms of fairness or wisdom, but we think that that was the inevitable and we submit that it was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.796" offset="4982575">It was wrong for it to have overruled the Board's judgment in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1228.610" offset="5017788">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.078" offset="5031685">The unique feature of this case is that there is no current labor dispute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.865" offset="5058853">There was no preexisting working condition which had been brought to the attention of management of this company which had been made the subject of a labor controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.128" offset="5111933">And as a matter of fact, the Board itself made no specific finding that there -- that there was a current labor dispute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.545" offset="5149550">They merely adverted to what they called prior complaints about the cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.017" offset="5171388">What were these prior complaints?</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.449" offset="5185181">There were on -- there were seven employees who were discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.673" offset="5202108">Only three of these employees testified on the subject of prior working conditions, and these three did not use the word complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.538" offset="5253517">The general counsel asked them whether they had made any complaints before this walkout about working condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.161" offset="5287999">Caron, the leader, said he used to talk to the foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.817" offset="5306598">He talked to the foreman about the cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.204" offset="5320182">The second man, Heinlein, said he remarked about the cold on prior occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.329" offset="5348707">He remarked, as a matter of fact, when I -- when I on cross-examination asked him about these remarks, he said he spoke several times during the past six months, maybe a year, maybe two years ago whereas, only two months prior, in November of 1958, the respondent installed a 500,000 BTU furnace in a shop, an additional furnace, not a replacement but an additional furnace in a shop, the heat from which flowed in to this machine shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.959" offset="5483186">Now, it seems to me that this completely knocks out any value that the Heinlein testimony had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.336" offset="5512756">Now, the third witness is a man named George, and George was asked about prior complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.203" offset="5540133">But did he respond by saying complaint?</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.529" offset="5549537">He said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.824" offset="5554657">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.581" offset="5557687">He asked the foreman several times why the furnace would not put out more heat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.777" offset="5578480">Now, this is the sum total of the evidence in this case about a current labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.979" offset="5611290">There was no -- there was no concerted action taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.937" offset="5627068">These -- these so-called remarks asks about -- asking about the cold, used to talk about the cold were topics of conversation such as you have in every plant with the doors opening and shutting, bringing business in and out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.024" offset="5695509">It was -- they were topics of conversation just as they were topics of conversation during the summer when the men were breaking about the heat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.069" offset="5731662">Now, to raise this evidence into a current labor dispute, with which Congress was concerned, with which -- which leads to strikes, which obstruct commerce, which gives this Court and the Board the very source of jurisdictional power to govern actions which are involved here, to raise this evidence into a current labor dispute is absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.718" offset="5842213">There was -- there was not -- there was no concerted action whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.360" offset="5856841">There were -- there was no labor organization involved in this case whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.293" offset="5876590">There was no organizational activity involved in this case whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.420" offset="5897070">There were seven men, working in a machine shop, it was a cold day, 15 degrees, 18 degrees below the normal for that day, the winds were howling from 23 to 43 miles an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.190" offset="5952136">The furnace -- the main furnace, 1,500,000 BTU furnace was not operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.848" offset="5982751">The watchman didn't know how to start it for some strange reason, but it was not operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.755" offset="6002395">It was started just as soon as the company electrician arrived at the plant at 7:15 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.952" offset="6031130">These men were huddled outside of the foreman's shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.900" offset="6050983">The leader told the men what the foreman had said to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.537" offset="6069478">If they had any guts, they'd go home, and so they went home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.622" offset="6085883">They went home because it was cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.403" offset="6096959">We do not deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.183" offset="6104064">They went home because of what Caron told them that Jarvis said about them, if they had any guts, they'd go home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.983" offset="6139277">These were the two reasons the men went home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.456" offset="6153174">The men did not go home because there was a current labor dispute, because this was a protest against the cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.131" offset="6183894">The men went home because it was cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.745" offset="6194343">Now, why is the existence of a current labor dispute so important?</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.372" offset="6228825">As I said previously, the labor dispute is the very source from which this Court and from which the Board and from which Congress attains jurisdiction to act in matters of this kind. Section 1 of the Wagner Act is very explicit on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.968" offset="6303222">Section 2 (3) defining employee and Section 2 (9) defining labor dispute expressly recognizes the need for a current labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.361" offset="6368841">Section 2 (3) preserves an employee's status under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.839" offset="6394755">It recognizes that if an employee ceases work as a result of unfair labor practice, he remains an employee under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.834" offset="6438745">Section 2 (3) states further that where there is economic strike involved, not an unfair labor practice but the employer, where an employee ceases work in consequence of or in connection with a current labor dispute, he remains an employee under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.382" offset="6520874">Therefore, I say that in this case unless there is current labor dispute, the statute does not recognize these employees as retaining their employee status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.905" offset="6582941">The Mackay case referred to by Mr. Manoli holds just this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.295" offset="6608541">There was a question before this Court in that case as to whether there was a current labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.255" offset="6632364">This Court found that there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.246" offset="6640306">There were negotiations, collective bargaining negotiations leading towards the hope of a contract governing wages, hours and working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.259" offset="6684400">There is no such thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.104" offset="6695790">This Court's decision in the Labor Board against the Electrical Workers likewise recognizes the importance of the concerted activity occurring in the context of a current labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.161" offset="6760051">Now, not only does Section 2 (3) of the Act recognize the importance of a current labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.505" offset="6789413">Section 10 (c) which gives the Board the power to reinstate employees to effectuate the policies of the Act refers to employee to obtain a definition of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.862" offset="6854823">We go back to Section 2 (3) where again we arrived at the requirements of a current labor dispute before employees quitting work, retain their employee status under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.556" offset="6929638">Now, we submit that the Board should have made a finding as to whether or not the evidence consisted of -- constituted a current labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.419" offset="6989093">They passed over this jurisdictional prerequisite I believe because of their belief that the punishment was disproportionate to the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.527" offset="7041442">They thought the discipline was too severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.043" offset="7055548">But it is submitted that the harshness or the mildness of discipline is not a matter for the Board to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.472" offset="7097240">Management is much better qualified at least in this one phase of Labor Relations to decide what is best to maintain order and discipline in a particular plant governed by peculiar conditions of the business in this particular plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.707" offset="7174248">It is not for the Board to decide whether discipline is harsh or severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.225" offset="7204237">And we believe that in this case, the Board was in actuality substituting its judgment for that of management in the question of the severity of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.582" offset="7261706">Turning now to the question, assuming arguendo that the facts in this case can support a finding of a current labor dispute, where are we then?</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.938" offset="7335163">Assuming that the testimony of these three men asking about the cold, remarking about the cold, talking about the cold can be ballooned into a labor dispute, where are we?</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.728" offset="7394304">The employee -- the employer discharged these men for a cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.086" offset="7423666">The cause was that the men left the plant without notice to the foreman, without discussing the matter with the foreman, without requesting anything of the foreman, without investigating whether or not the furnace was running, without asking for a conference, without making an ultimatum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.380" offset="7520841">They did not inform anybody of the action they were taking of the objects they sought of the purposes they thought that they were going to achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.292" offset="7572564">The true motives of the employer in this case and there's no evidence that contradict this or simply to punish the men for infraction of the plant rule, namely leaving the plant without permission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.497" offset="7829400">I think the evidence will show Your Honor that Caron and Jarvis, the leader and the foreman frequently talked together in a jocular fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.771" offset="7882480">They frequently kidded one another about activities in and about the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.942" offset="7903169">This was not a serious conversation that took place in the foreman's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.827" offset="7922709">I think the record will bear that out Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.145" offset="7951966">Now, the Board did not try to explain to discredit or give any reasons for disregarding the employer's evidence of the reasons or the motives behind the discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.683" offset="8030124">I don't know why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.020" offset="8035453">I think it is incumbent upon the Board in discharge cases to give some reason for disregarding the evidence of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.858" offset="8086758">The House Conference Report, Number 510 of the 88th Congress points this out very clearly at page 56.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.865" offset="8122807">And then Section 10 (c) as enacted by the Taft-Hartley Act completely deprives the Board of power to reinstate employees discharged for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.729" offset="8178291">That is the language of Section 10 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.828" offset="8194696">The Board shall not have power to reinstate employees who are suspended or discharged for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.267" offset="8240462">So on page 75 of the appendix A to the respondent's brief, the last paragraph of Section 10 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.012" offset="8311411">Now, it maybe asked what happens when you have a conflict between 10 (c) giving the employer the power to discharge for cause and Section 7, giving the employees right to take concerted action for their mutual aid and protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.984" offset="8395316">I have no difficulty reconciling the two Sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.467" offset="8413288">It seems to me that Section 7 contemplates something that has to do with an employer unfair labor practice, which is not involved here a prior preexisting unfair labor practice, or it must have something to do with collective bargaining, negotiation, conference, self-organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.397" offset="8524988">Here in this case as I say, there was no notice, no demand, no ultimatum, no discussion, no conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.947" offset="8555186">You have a bold unannounced walkout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.478" offset="8577233">Turning to the employer's activities in this case, you have no refusal by the company to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.381" offset="8604923">You have the instant action of the company in trying to correct the condition and the condition was corrected within minutes after the electrician arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.460" offset="8649226">Working temperatures were normal by noontime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.962" offset="8667199">Two months prior, the company had installed a 500,000 BTU furnace in a shop to supplement the heating plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.645" offset="8713906">So, we have here, it seems to me, a way to reconcile Section 10 (c) and Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.922" offset="8771062">Section 7 uses the word other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid and protection and it is submitted that the word other refers back to collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.140" offset="8839920">The mutual aid refers to an attempt by the employees to aid themselves in improving working conditions as to which there is a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.875" offset="8890911">It contemplates going to the employer conferring with him, negotiating with him, and if unable to agree then to take the ultimate weapon and strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.150" offset="8947963">But it contemplates in the first instance some attempt to resolve disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.061" offset="8971577">The words mutual protection do not refer to protection against working condition and it is submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.756" offset="9002402">If there is an abnormally dangerous working condition, the employee is fully protected by Section 502 of the Act which states that if they quit in good faith because of abnormally dangerous conditions per work at the place of employment, this quitting shall not be deemed to strike under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.942" offset="9107101">In other words, this definition confirms our thesis namely that when an employees walkout without making a demand or without conferring with their employer in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.840" offset="9166764">But, because of some dangerous condition of work, this is not a strike in the true sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.139" offset="9191946">A strike contemplates the ultimate weapon following a demand upon the employer or a concession and a refusal by the employer to concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.635" offset="9249938">Now, I say that protecting an unannounced walkout of the nature we have here will not effectuate the policies of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.666" offset="9294033">And then unless a reinstatement will effectuate the policies of the Act that cannot be ordered under Section 10 (c).</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.746" offset="10510399">And you have to try to reconcile the employer's right to discharge under 10 (c) with the employees' right to take concerted action under Section 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="2633.548" offset="10637563">The employer's motives behind the discharge have long been looked at by this Court in other cases, and the power of the employer to discharge has been upheld by this Court time and again, Jones &amp; Laughlin, the Fansteel case, they all advert to the fact that the Wagner Act does not interfere with the right of the employer to select and discharge his men.</text>
