            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="39.137" offset="259950">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.534" offset="273533">This case, here on a writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit, once again brings before the Court the perplexing problem of when an action brought against a government official to restrain acts done in his official capacity is in fact an action against the United States which cannot be maintained in the absence of consent by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.544" offset="377501">Specifically, the question in this case is whether an action may be maintained to reject a federal officer from land that he holds in his official capacity and the basic facts are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.411" offset="445001">The petitioner in this case, Mr. Malone, is a Forest Service Officer in the United States Forest Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.185" offset="480110">In 1959, the respondents instituted an action in the State Courts of Georgia an ejectment to eject the petitioner from certain lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.889" offset="526921">The action was brought in the traditional fictitious form which is employed in Georgia that is the complaint alleged that the respondents had demised the land to one John Doe that when John Doe had entered onto to the land and then that one Richard Roe had forcibly evicted him from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.937" offset="611140">And under the settled practice in Georgia in that kind of a case, the real party in interest, the respondent, is not permitted to challenge any of these allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.445" offset="653145">He asked to admit the fact one of the least, two, the fact of entry into possession and three, the fact of the ouster and as we have indicated in our brief in -- under the Georgia practice, this is a method by which basically the title to land is determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.526" offset="729527">The Government and, I might mention that the process in the case was served upon both the petitioner, Mr. Malone and upon the United States, the Government removed the case from the state court to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.732" offset="790340">And in its petition for removal, which is set forth at pages one and two of the record, the Government alleged that it had acquired the land by a deed in 1936 that since that time, it had lawfully owned and possessed the same and that the petitioner, Mr. Malone, at all times held the land solely by virtue of his official position and under color of his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.817" offset="898591">After the case had been removed into the District Court, the United States and the petitioner then moved to dismiss the case on the ground that the suit was one directed against the United States and the United States have not consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.229" offset="956270">And after a pretrial conference and a hearing, the District Court granted the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.136" offset="983960">The District Court pointed out that at the pretrial conference, the respondent's counsel had conceded the correctness of the allegations in the petition for removal that at all times the petitioner, Mr. Malone, held the land by virtue of the color of his office and as result of his official position.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.068" offset="1067656">And the court ruled that on the basis of those facts, this case was controlled by the court's decision of this Court in Larson against Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corporation in 337 U.S. about which I will have much to say shortly and that accordingly, it was a suit against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.633" offset="1157935">A divided Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.027" offset="1171519">And I think a fair reading of the opinion of the Fifth Circuit is that in the court's view, this case was not controlled by Larson but was controlled by the earlier decision of this Court in United States against Lee in 106.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.437" offset="1229093">And so we think this case, as it comes to this Court, presents fairly the question whether in this type of a situation, this Court's decision in Larson controls or whether the Lee case controls and I'd like briefly --</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="298.592" offset="1297742">Yes, I think it is left virtually nothing Mr. Justice at least in its application to this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.569" offset="1325641">I like to refer briefly to the facts in the Larson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.421" offset="1345076">In the Larson case, the War Assets Administrator had entered into a contract to sell certain surplus coal of the Government to the Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.420" offset="1393037">A dispute arose between the Administrator and the Foreign Commerce Corporation over the terms of the contract and the Administrator ultimately concluded that the contract had been breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.905" offset="1442983">He then undertook to sell the coal to someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.276" offset="1460433">The company instituted a suit in the District Court to enjoin the Administrator from doing this on the theory first, that there had been no breach of the contract and secondly, that under the terms of the contract, title had passed to the company, and therefore, that what the Administrator was trying to do was improperly to dispose of property which belonged to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.031" offset="1567535">This Court, after a thorough review of the authorities in the case in this field, concluded that this was in fact a suit against the United States, and therefore, could not be maintained and the Court enunciated the basic principle that where an action to compel specific relief for -- against a government official, acting in his official capacity, is brought, it is in fact the suit against the sovereign unless one of two conditions is met, either that it's alleged and shown, and the court said it had to be specifically alleged, that the officer is acting beyond the scope of his authority or secondly, if the officer is acting within the purported scope of his authority that such authority is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.712" offset="1778186">In other words, in those two situations, relief maybe had against the officer and that it is not relief against the sovereign because the relief is sought against conduct that is beyond the officer's authority, either the officer's actual authority or the officer's valid authority and in that situation, the actions of the officer are not fairly viewed as the actions of the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.360" offset="1892812">Now, in this case, we think it's clear that neither of those conditions has been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.605" offset="1921755">There's no allegation here and no claim that Mr. Malone in holding this land in his official capacity is acting beyond the scope of his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.032" offset="1959476">Indeed, to the contrary, the respondents admitted in the District Court that Mr. Malone was acting solely by virtue of his official position.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.808" offset="2066578">The -- at the time of this suit, this was something called “a land utilization project”.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.036" offset="2103568">As I understand it, since this suit was brought, it has become a part of something called the Oconee National Forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.949" offset="2131153">There are 109 acres involved in this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.436" offset="2149125">Nor is there any allegation, and we do not think there could be any showing that Mr. Malone in this case is acting unconstitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.490" offset="2189354">The only possible theory upon which it could be contended that there is any unconstitutional holding of this land by the petitioner is that the land was being held or taken without permitting the respondent's just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.455" offset="2265213">And there's no claim made to that effect and we think that such a claim could not be made here because if the allegation is and this is the claim that the Government is illegally holding this land, presumably the illegal taking of the land occurred in 1936 when the Government acquired this property by deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.864" offset="2350791">And we believe that as of -- as of the present time at least and some time thereafter, at least as of 1936, at that time if there was such a taking, the respondents had an adequate remedy by a suit for just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.146" offset="2423933">We also believe that upon passage of the Tort Claims Act, if in fact Mr. Malone was improperly upon the respondent's land, at that point an action for trespass might have been maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.531" offset="2481507">Now, the -- neither of these is the theory upon which the respondents seek to maintain this action --</text>

            <text syncTime="638.146" offset="2656005">Now, we think this specific suggestion that a suit of this type may be maintained was prese -- was rejected in the Larson case and quite explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.172" offset="2700100">In Larson, the Court stated that it would not permit what it called a third category of cases against which an action might be brought against a government official.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.770" offset="2742418">And the Court stated at page 692 of its opinion as the third category of cases where the official, “Wrongfully takes or holds a specific property to which the plaintiff has title” and on that -- that theory that it would be a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.505" offset="2809396">And the Court stated, I might mention preliminarily in the discussion of the different types of situations in the Larson case to which the bar of sovereign immunity is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.645" offset="2857984">The Court specifically referred to actions of ejectment.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.076" offset="2875643">The Court pointed out in its opinion that the problem in this field arose not in connection with a suit for damages because that -- in that case where the officer is held personally liable for damages, that will not impinge on the sovereign's property, but in other types of action where action of the officer is sought to be restrained or directed and it mentioned as one of the types of these action -- actions for ejectment.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.596" offset="2969788">The Court stated in the Larson case that the mere allegation of the officer, acting officially, wrongfully holds property to which the plaintiff has title, does not meet the requirement in this field that it must also appear that the action to be restrained or directed is not the action of the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.741" offset="3050350">The point continued that since -- if the officer is exercising such powers that is, the powers delegated to him by the sovereign, the action is the sovereign's and a suit to enjoin it may not be brought until the sovereign has consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.660" offset="3110013">I think the rationale of that ruling is this, that as long as the officer is acting within the scope of his valid authority, he is in fact acting for the sovereign and if he is acting for the sovereign, his action may not be interfered with unless the sovereign has consented.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.128" offset="5475871">The claim of title upon which the respondents rely, which I say it goes way back more than a century, the last one in the chain of title, the predecessors of the present respondents, I believe, died in 1928 and so that at least presumably as of that time, these people came into whatever property interest they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.495" offset="5577331">Now, I would like also to refer briefly a little bit to the character of this action in the ejectment in the Georgia courts because the Court of Appeals stated that the only issue involved in the Georgia ejectment action is possession not title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.855" offset="5646817">And therefore, they had suggested that the Lee case really was a different animal because there, in the Lee case, there was a question as to title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.866" offset="5678791">Now, the Georgia courts have stated that possession is the object of an ejectment action, but it's in the object of an ejectment action only in the sense that the plaintiff was out of possession, wants to get possession for the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.659" offset="5745977">And he wants to get possession of the property because he claims he has a better title than the respondent who is in possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.712" offset="5782235">And in this case, the only way that the respondents could possibly get possession of this property as against the petitioner, Mr. Malone, is to show that the title under which Mr. Malone holds it that is his authority is in fact not a valid title and thus, the only way that they can prevail in this action, we think, is by challenging the title of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.509" offset="5909400">And indeed, the Court of Appeals, although it repeatedly stated that possession is the only issue involved in a Georgia ejectment suit, nevertheless, acknowledged at page 23 of its opinion, I'm sorry, page 25 of the opinion, that under the Georgia proceedings, the respondents will be able to show that the United States did not own any title to the lands which would defeat appellants' claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.564" offset="6065612">So necessarily, in disposing of this ejectment action on the merits, the lower courts would have to reach the question of the title of the United States to these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.470" offset="6121200">And the title of the United States to these lands, it seems to me, the question relating to that, is necessarily a suit against the sovereign and since the theory upon which the respondents are challenging this title is inherently an attack upon the title, the suit against the petitioner, the suit against the petitioner who admittedly holds this land under his lawful authority necessarily is a suit against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.515" offset="6249409">It's a suit against the United States because its effect, if allowed to go to judgment, would be to interfere with the property of the sovereign.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.990" offset="8091355">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.008" offset="8115388">As the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit says, this case is identical with Lee versus Uni -- United States versus Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.548" offset="8173589">The Government's attorney has skipped over altogether Land, Chairman of the Maritime Commission versus Dollar, Stanley Dollar, Dollar Steamship Lines and those other parties to that case in which you held that a suit for the recovery of prop -- for possession of property could be maintained against government agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.860" offset="8310784">In Land versus Dollar, Mr. Land and the other members of the Maritime Commission got a hold to the stock of the Dollar family and the Dollar Steamship Lines and wouldn't return it back to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.953" offset="8367208">They contented that the stock was only pledged to the Maritime Commission for a loan and the loan had been paid and when the loan was paid, they demanded their stock and the Government then came in with the same contention here, you are asking for a judgment that will expend itself on the United States Treasury and even if you pledged it and have paid it, you cannot maintain this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.758" offset="8498448">Now here, we have a suit that is a common practice in Georgia and the only thing that -- this is what we call the John Doe-Richard Roe form of ejectment instead of bringing a ten or 15-page suit in equity and the easiest way you get thrown out of court in Georgia is bring an equitable action for the possession of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.279" offset="8596459">I've tried it myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.684" offset="8602102">In fact, the Government has cited one case here, Nottingham versus Elliott, in which I was a writer of the brief in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.478" offset="8637315">They dismissed me on demurrer in the lower court and affirmed it on the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.471" offset="8661243">You can't get ex -- equitable relief in Georgia if you have a plain legal remedy and a -- as our writers have said in Georgia, the ingenuity of land has never found a method to test the possession of land that our John Doe-Richard Roe form of ejectment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.144" offset="8747969">You come in to court and you put it down squarely to a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.040" offset="8763538">You say, “You are on my land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.880" offset="8774928">Get off!”</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.933" offset="8779107">And it's just a few lines on the John Doe-Richard Roe form of ejectment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.398" offset="8796975">Then, the man that you say transcends possession says, “He can go so far as to say I…”, but of course they generally say, “I am not guilty of the acts complained of”, and that's all the answer you need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.042" offset="8867506">The law says, you admit that he is in possession and he has got -- that you -- you say that the other man in his possession and the defendant has got to come in and say, “Yeah, I'm in possession and I've -- I've ousted you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.852" offset="8926751">And I'm entitled to stay in possession”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.984" offset="8935320">Under that writ or under that action, you only get a writ of possession for the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.565" offset="8961651">Then we have what we call, “man's profits” that if he has farmed it then owe some rent, you will make a further allegation as to man's profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.728" offset="9002297">In this case, if the Government had gone in there and cut out timber, this tract of timber as this land is heavily timbered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.669" offset="9034062">It has started off back during the depression days as what we call “a shutdown in Georgia”, rehab farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.691" offset="9082128">I think it was Rehabilitation Resettlement Corporation, if I remember correctly the name, but the Government vowed up a lot of land and put farmers in that site to help the economies on in Middle Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.660" offset="9150046">Now, in 19 -- in 1857, Mr. Tolan, the ancestors of these people made a will, the same type of will that Mr. Custis made to General Lee's daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.109" offset="9223816">He left it to her -- her lifetime and then as her death to her son -- to her children, George W C -- Custis Lee brought this action against the Admiral or the General Land in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.199" offset="9292152">In 1857, Mr. Tolan made a will deeding his pro -- willing his property to his children and he left it to the ancestors, the mother of two of Lees and the grandchildren of other say “She shall have it her lifetime and at her death that it should go to her children”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.611" offset="9373863">Now, this is getting into facts and the Government's argument has been in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.140" offset="9391940">We can show the facts to be identical with the Lee case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.776" offset="9646477">But we say that as -- as Judge Cameron of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says a careful examination of Lee shows that it has been cited 300 and something times and by the Supreme Court, 58 times on the distinguished form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.900" offset="9738951">You cited it in the case of Land versus Dollar when you've held that a type action for the possession of property could be maintained against the officer in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.009" offset="9787434">Now, they talked about acting outside of his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.902" offset="9803003">We say in this case when we bring this action to dispossess the government agents in charge, he has walked on our land there whether he had -- it has been done by his superiors ordering or in the Lee case, by order of the President and that as the Lee case went more in which the Government went in there and just took without any reasonable rhyme as counsel -- opposing counsel says in the Lee case the Government levied on it, put taxes, I don't know what kind of taxes they could have assessed at that time because we have no -- have no ad valorem tax now but possibly that did have at that time, but the Government sold it and the basis that Mr. George Washington thought Custis Lee recovered it was that -- the general holding it or the tax collectors holding it, refused to permit a friend of Mrs. Lee to pay the taxes and held that they had to come up there and personally pay it, of course it was highly in front of all of it, Mrs. Lee would come up personally and pay the taxes at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.577" offset="10165687">And they went to trial on -- it went to trial in Virginia before jury and that the Virginia jury and the courts held that they acquired no title by that illegal land.</text>

            <text syncTime="2558.266" offset="10336423">They got by far this land on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.421" offset="10345096">It is now what we called the Piedmont Reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.913" offset="10358993">Locally, they haven't -- they signed there, showing the ducks flying by and we have a game preserved on their own part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.266" offset="10396400">The Government owns a considerable lake ridge in that territory but I -- for park purposes but back, when they acquired this land by purchase for the Rehabilitation and Settlement Corporation, I don't believe it was in the constitutional authority to condemn it and in getting down to the facts on why it is our land, my clients, mother and grandmother acquired a life estate in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.786" offset="10526490">She sold that life estate to a man named Roberts in 1873, Roberts in 1900, sold it to Browns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.620" offset="10577899">Browns -- and the she went and sold 109 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.524" offset="10593468">Well our statute law in Georgia says if you haven't applied for estate even if you make a straight how to warrant a deed, you only convey whatever life -- the life estate you had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.808" offset="10634637">No question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.446" offset="10641115">And then when Roberts sold some 500 acres.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.095" offset="10675702">Then in 1936, Brown sold it to the Government, but our contention is if it -- if we can sue and the only thing involved here, simplify, I believe, and it just appeared in court in April of 1959 and we have been arguing almost three years on the jurisdiction facts that are involved here.</text>
