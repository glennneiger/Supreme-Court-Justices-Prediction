            <text syncTime="24.186" offset="200077">The petitioner was indicted on 19 counts for declining to answer certain questions of the Senate Internal Subcommittee put to him on January 6, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.898" offset="250964">He was tried without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.598" offset="257755">He was convicted on all counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.830" offset="266742">He was sentenced to a term of 6 months suspended prison sentence and a fine of $500.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.269" offset="292446">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the conviction and Your Honors granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.028" offset="323480">At the time of his appearance before the subcommittee on internal security, the petitioner appropriately raised questions concerning the authority of the subcommittee and concerning the pertinency of the questions which were asked him, objections which were renewed throughout the course of his interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.392" offset="404982">He answered fully all questions concerning his own acknowledged membership in the Communist Party between the years 1935 and 1948 and made it entirely clear to the committee that all of his activities have been lawful, political activities when engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.479" offset="481259">He declined, however, to answer any questions which sought the names of persons who have been associated with him in the Communist Party or from which their identity might readily be ascertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.220" offset="540296">At his trial, the petitioner took the stand in his own defense; he testified at some length concerning the reasons which had led him to the depths of the depression in 1935 to become a member of the Communist Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.367" offset="640815">In 1935 -- well, I believe he graduated in '34 in the event he was comparatively recently out of college.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.832" offset="670699">He explained that his studies of history had convinced him that third parties had exercised an energizing influence in American political life.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.142" offset="707897">He described at some length or offered to prove his activities within the party which were the usual rather humdrum activities attending public meetings, distributing leaflets, selling copies of the Daily Worker and the rest of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.209" offset="764217">He made it clear that his membership in the party had not been clandestine, that it was known to his friends and associates, that he engaged in no conspiratorial activities and that the same was true so far he was aware of those who were associated with him in the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.167" offset="828061">Indeed there is, if the Court please, a striking parallel between the reasons for his entering the party and his activities within it and those of (Inaudible) which Your Honors held were insufficient to warn his exclusion from the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.580" offset="889710">He also testified at length concerning his growing disinterest in the party; his eventual dissatisfaction with it and his reasons for leaving the party in 1948, some 8 years prior to the time of his interrogation by the subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.490" offset="965360">He was asked at trial to state his reasons for declining to answer the questions which had been put to him and he responded as follows; I read from page 9 of our brief and I omit some portions of his answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.794" offset="1026591">He said, ?I felt that by I being compelled to answer the questions which I decline to answer that I would be cast in the role of an informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.902" offset="1058983">Unlike most Americans, I have been brought up to despise and deplore the tattletale, the squealer and the informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.149" offset="1092002">I felt I would be violating the principles and tenets on which I have been brought up, if I were asked to assume that role.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.723" offset="1122304">I felt that I knew that I have engaged only during the period of Communist Party membership only in lawful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.107" offset="1151770">I knew that my associates had engaged only during the period on Communist Party membership only in lawful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.854" offset="1182804">I felt that as a result of what I knew to be the case, that if I were to name names to be an informer, that the result would be terrible trouble on the shoulders and the heads of people to were as innocent as I of any wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.922" offset="1239019">I was confirmed in this belief by the fact that I knew my own knowledge of people who had lost jobs, whose careers have been wrecked; whose families have been upset, whose children have been dislocated purely because I have been exposed to the committee by somebody for what in its own time had been perfectly legal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.509" offset="1321357">And I felt that it would be a mean and ignoble thing if I would be defective; an agent to bring destruction on people.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.799" offset="1354585">I knew that of course it would be possible to save my own skin by giving the committee what it was pressing me for; namely the names of other people, but I felt that I couldn't in all conscience do this because it seemed to me that one of the great heritages and privileges that I had as a citizen in a democracy was that of personal responsibility for my acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.865" offset="1446849">I felt certain as a matter of inner conscience here, that I could not disclose the names of innocent people in order to be a possible benefit to myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.032" offset="1487496">I realize that as a result, I would undoubtedly have to stay on trial for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.419" offset="1509021">The likelihood arose of going to jail which I am not anxious to do, but I'm here less anxious sir to become in my own eyes an ignominious person and I feel deeply that I would utterly lose my self-respect were I to violate the terms of my own inner integrity.?</text>

            <text syncTime="476.946" offset="2011199">Now at the outset of applying the Barenblatt balancing test, we're faced with a serious problem which has plagued this case from its very inception and that is that to know what the subject under inquiry was.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.719" offset="2086222">We have appended to our brief as Appendix A, a tabulation which shows what the subjects under inquiry in this case and its companion cases was asserted to be at various stages of this inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.947" offset="2139199">And Your Honors will readily see from that the other confusion and inconsistency which has followed this issue through this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.183" offset="2176084">This served to emphasize Mr. Fanelli's argument that unless the subject under inquiry is clearly stated in the indictment, the government is free at each and every stage of the case to change its position with respect to what the subject under inquiry was.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.697" offset="2246196">For the purposes of my argument here, I will assume that the subject under inquiry was that which the government now asserts it to be, noting that they have changed their positions since they filed their brief in opposition to certiorari and I will say only that which they now define as communist activities in news media.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.115" offset="2579832">Since this was not a question which sought the identity of others and since the petitioner had left the Communist Party some eight years before, the answer to that question would almost certainly have been, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.281" offset="2628524">Or the committee might have inquired, do you have any information about communist activities in news media since the passage of the Internal Security Act of 1950, the administration and enforcement of which it is one of the duties of the committee to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.434" offset="2693099">Again the petitioner would almost certainly have answered that question, ?no?; and what is significant about this case is that nothing which even remotely approaches those two possibly pertinent questions were put to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.411" offset="2749001">On the contrary, the committee promptly rummaged around in ancient history.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.317" offset="2768645">The first question they asked him which he declined to answer related in 1938, 18 years prior to this inquiry, and the most recent question which he declined to answer related to 1948, 8 years before the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.673" offset="2830085">Now, we suggest to this temporal remoteness and which we would acquaint with these spatial remoteness on which Your Honor relied in Deutch, has in this case a certain special significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.693" offset="2878151">It might properly be said I think that 1950 marks a kind of watershed in the public and official attitude toward the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.351" offset="2916812">Prior to that time it was by and large regarded as another lawful political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.659" offset="2941994">In that year, this Internal Security Act was adopted, in that year Your Honors has decided American Communications Association against Douds and it was in that year that Korean hostilities erupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.221" offset="2996224">So we say that for the purposes of the Barenblatt balancing test, questions which relate to years prior to the 1950 must weigh much less in the scale than activities engaged in subsequent to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.923" offset="3059022">Obviously, activities engaged in during this period will have far less impact on the national security than activities engaged in since not only because they are more remote in time, but also because they differ importantly with the three.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.064" offset="3123597">And we think it is important that all of the questions asked related to lawful political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.558" offset="3145644">Now I'm of course aware that Your Honors have held that law -- inquiry in the lawful political activities on the part of these committees is proper, but Your Honors have not held to my knowledge that this is not a relevant consideration to bear in mind for the purposes of accomplishing the balancing test in Barenblatt, that is to say obviously there is a significant difference I would suggest in the standard of pertinency which might properly be applied, in the case of the congressional committee investigating a present plot to blow up the White House and questioning of the kind here involved which seeks only information concerning remote, lawful political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.027" offset="3339473">Now, it seems to me that what I've said to this point is relevant in judging the petitioner's private interest, that is to say faced as he was with these questions, I think that he might well feel himself fortified in asserting his reasons of personal privacy by the fact that what the committees sought was remote in time, concerned lawful activity and had -- could shed little light on the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.098" offset="3467786">But the -- I cannot improve on the petitioner's own statement of the urgent, compelling personal, private reasons which led him to decline to answer these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.149" offset="3524002">I would only ask that Your Honors recall that this inquiry took place in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.974" offset="3547303">This was at time when the country was beginning to emerge from that era of our history which for want of a better name we call McCarthyism.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.449" offset="3589204">For months, for years prior to this hearing, the public prints have been full of innocent law abiding citizens who had been humiliated, persecuted, vilified sometimes even to the point of suicide and death because I have been revealed before one or another of these committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.105" offset="3675826">The petitioner's fears that his answers to these questions might bring harm to innocent persons were not factitious or contrived notions.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.069" offset="3719607">They were headlines of the time and I suggest to Your Honors that if under the Barenblatt balancing test, the desire of a citizen to avoid unjustified harm to innocent people is not a sufficient justification of personal privacy then none will ever be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.525" offset="3821484">This moral, this epical, this humane, this disinteresting reason for declining to answer, is the most compelling reason that this Court will ever have put before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.200" offset="5596139">And the reason for the Act of 1857 was not an alleviating reason at all, it was an enforcing reason</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.678" offset="5770115">We do not wish to have congressmen or senators asking impertinent questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.583" offset="5825703">Now, I think that there's no inconsistency, Your Honor, between those two and to suggest that the Congress was doing nothing but being blind to the interest of the citizen in this case in adopting the statute, I think carries it much too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.959" offset="5879202">I think the Congress can be credited with the same interest in protecting the constitutional rights of the citizen as this Court is and there is no reason why the Congress cannot seek the aid of the judiciary precisely in protecting the constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.744" offset="6118379">They are constitutional problems and I suggest the to you that nothing is more probable than that the Congress specifically desire the aid and counsel of the judiciary in protecting the constitutional rights of the citizen and that it is wrong to suppose that these limitations are limitations which the judiciary puts on the investigating rights of Congress that they are in effect restraints which the Congress has been put on itself and which it seeks the aid of the federal courts and administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.232" offset="6248260">If Your Honors please, the inquisition has always had an insatiable appetite for names whether it be Torquemada or Titus Oates, Cotton Mather or Savannah Rolla or Lavrenti Beria or Heinrich Himmler, there is an impelling necessity to seek ever longer lists of names because only in this way can may color the pretense that there is a monstrous conspiracy against the state of which they and they alone are the true defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.618" offset="6421817">As this lust for names increases, all forms of due process are forgotten.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.160" offset="6560057">And it precisely at this point that the citizen standing up and saying, I acknowledge my responsibility for my acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.412" offset="6637066">It is at this point that the dramatic clash between the felt needs of the inquisition and the ethical, the moral, the religious impulse of the citizen rise to their dramatic climax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.083" offset="6703731">And it is precisely at that point that the determination must be made as it has always been made whether or not the net of suspicion shall be thrown ever wider, drawing in successively larger numbers of the innocent with the guilty or whether or not the line of inquiry shall be held within the bounds of a civilized and orderly society.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.881" offset="7402872">First, that question does not involve petitioners and the amicus contention that the first amendment protects a witness from having to disclose the names of persons with whom he has associated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.790" offset="7450520">The question called for no names and considering the size of the staff of the New York Herald Tribune which petitioner indicated in the hearings was a couple of, a couple of hundred perhaps exclusive of mechanical, that's at 1742 of the hearings and further since he had disclosed to the committee any of the names of the people in the unit he had been with in 1948, we submit that there is no way in which an answer to the question would have identified the names of any of petitioner's former associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.750" offset="7578415">Secondly, the question does not involve the problem of remoteness in time that that petitioner has argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.507" offset="7605373">It concerned the persons employed by the New York Herald Tribune at the time of the hearings, that is in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.459" offset="7633168">Now, of course it was linked with the petitioner since his last activities had been in that cell in 1948, but I would like to emphasize in connection with the petitioner's argument on this point of remoteness that while there may have been what he describes to be a high, a watermark in 1950, that this makes it all the more important for the committees investigating this problem to able to look at information prior to 1950 because this watermark will also determine the time when by and large it became more and more difficult to find anything out of the party's activities and only by developing the background prior to the time that the party, excuse me, what more and more underground that the committees were able to develop any information at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.653" offset="7862000">Thirdly, assuming that the question under inquiry was communist infiltration into the press and I shall go into that question in a moment, this question clearly does not involve a pertinency problem since it was plainly pertinent on its face to an inquiry and to communist infiltration in mass communications media and more particularly in the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.112" offset="7967848">The answer to the question would have contributed importantly to the subcommittee's knowledge as to the extent of communist infiltration into the newspapers in New York and might well provide a foundation for asking other questions that that petitioner may well have been willing to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.018" offset="8035453">For example, if his answer had been in the affirmative, there were still some people in the New York Herald Tribune who had been a member of that cell; questions such as how many of them, what their functions had been in the party, questions such as that might have been asked that is I say petitioner may have been willing to answer and that the amicus for example at page 12 its brief suggest what probably be appropriate since the committee did have a valid interest in determining the extent or at least the numerical extent of infiltration into mass media.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.726" offset="8186232">Now, petitioner does raise a number of other contentions that if sustained by this Court will invalidate the petitioner's conviction on all counts including count 7 which I have been focusing and I'd like to take up these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.665" offset="8233984">Broadly speaking, they relate the definition of the subject under inquiry, the pertinence of individual questions to that subject, the authority of the subcommittee to conduct the inquiry, the extent to which petitioner was informed of these matters and certain questions relating to the form of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.185" offset="8308067">I shall discuss each of these in turn and then with anytime remaining, I shall attempt to cover the points that go to the other counts in the indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2133.084" offset="8635747">Yes Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.576" offset="8641703">We will contend as I will spell out that on the basis of the circumstances of this case, the balance is clearly drawn in favor of the witness' having to answer but I certainly course to the extent of that as necessarily in the case of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.258" offset="8724355">I submit that an objective reading of this record will leave no doubt as to the subject under inquiry by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee at the hearings at which petitioner appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.187" offset="8772106">The subcommittee had for some 11 months, been conducting hearings on strategy and tactics of world communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.413" offset="8801050">Within that basic framework that on the basis of testimony given by one Winston Burdett who was a newspaper man and broadcaster, the subcommittee undertook to focus more particularly on communist infiltration into news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.757" offset="8862386">It held 3 days of hearings in January on 1956 at which 18 witnesses appeared; 17 of whom where then or recently have been employed as newsmen and other of whom was a film exhibitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.506" offset="8925393">At the outset of the hearings on January 4th, the Chairman of the subcommittee announced that the hearings about to commence stemmed from Burdett's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.497" offset="8965308">That the investigation of communist affiliations that resulted from that testimony disclosed, ?Many who were or are members of the press? and that ?the international communist conspiracy has as one of its primary aims the influencing of public opinion thus carrying on a psychological warfare against the United States and its institutions from inside by methods of penetration.?</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.699" offset="9074186">Then Senator Hennings said in a statement whose primary purpose was to disavow any attack on the free press to that, ?The committee is interested in the extent and nature of so-called communist infiltration if such exists into any news dispensing agency.?</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.302" offset="9148583">The Chairman expressed his agreement with Senator Hennings' statement in its entirety and also disavowed any attack on the free press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.075" offset="9183692">On January 6th, the 3rd day of the hearings and the day on which petitioner appeared, the proceeding is opened with a reading of a telegram from a New York newspaper in which the newspaper stated its agreement with the subcommittee's efforts to uncover communist infiltration wherever found and the Chairman responded by reaffirming the subcommittee's purpose to follow up the information concerning infiltration of persons identified as communists into news agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.196" offset="9304168">In a course of some remarks by Senator Hennings on that day he said, ?I think no one will quarrel with nor take issue with the fact that this committee has the right to inquire into all efforts or indeed all consummations of efforts of the Communist Party to infiltrate newspapers or other media of communications?.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.298" offset="9388596">The subcommittee then called Robert Shelton, the petitioner in number 9; who is employed as a copyreader with the New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.992" offset="9419316">Shelton was questioned primarily on whether or not he had any communist affiliations and about communist infiltration in the typographical union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.840" offset="9458709">The next witness was petitioner, and petitioner concedes that he was present at the beginning of the session that day incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.513" offset="9489429">By and large, the questioning of petitioner, himself, developed the character and duration of his employment by various newspapers, by TASS the Soviet news agency and by various communist front organizations, the nature and activities of the communist units to which the petitioner has been exposed and more particularly of the newspaper cells of the Communist Party to which he belonged and that the relationship of his party membership to his employment with these various newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.758" offset="9606353">One cannot read the testimony of this petitioner and that of the other witnesses in this set of hearings all of whom were in the communications field and all but one of whom were newsmen without becoming convinced that the hearings were in point of fact concerned with precisely what the Chairman announced would be the subject under the inquiry, the strategy and tactics of the communism that's reflected in communist infiltration into news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.225" offset="9720247">At petitioner's trial, the government established that this was the subject under inquiry by introducing the transcript of the hearings into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.601" offset="9757759">In addition, the subcommittee counsel testified that, ?In these particular hearings, we were in an area within the broad area of tactics and strategy within the narrower area of infiltration of mass communications,? that's at page 31 of the joint appendix And that the investigation was, ?Into the strategy and tactics of world communism of which this mass communications was an offshoot and apportion,? that's on page 37 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.202" offset="9872175">Now, there were references as counsel points out on his brief in the testimony of the subcommittee counsel, references to the investigation of communist activities generally but it is clear from the context of those remarks that he was referring to the basic investigation of which these 3-day set of hearings was but a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.716" offset="9966216">And similar statements by the Assistant United States Attorney are plain and can be explained in the same way where the rest of the transcript indicates clearly that he understood the subject under inquiry to be what I have said that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.053" offset="10023581">For example, at page 34 of the joint appendix, he said, ?You were indeed though inquiring were you not into mass communications infiltration by communists??</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.483" offset="10065272">And at page 37, his question was in this particular investigation in mass communications and generally in the tactics and strategy of world communism, was that commenced before or after the passage of the rule in 1955?</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.930" offset="10171120">Contrary to the representations that petitioner has made in this appendix to his brief, the Court of Appeals did identify and affirm the subject under inquiry to be precisely as I have described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.933" offset="10223156">The court by specific reference and that's at page 2 of the printed record found the subject under inquiry to be the same as it had found in the Shelton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.531" offset="10257533">In the Shelton case, its statement was, ?the broad subject matter of Communist Party infiltration and subversion and narrower subject of efforts to influence American public opinion and the specific effort to use the press to implement these objectives; that's at page 238 in the Shelton record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.792" offset="10330572">And then in its opinion in this case, the court below went on to find that certain other questions including count 7 which I have been discussing, ?were clearly pertinent to an investigation of subversive activities as manifested by the organization of members of the press into Communist Party cells in the period following World War II? and that's at page 3 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.818" offset="10430673">I submit that there is no basis for any doubt as to the subject that the subcommittee had under inquiry when it was questioning petitioner nor as the Court of Appeals found is there any possible doubt as to the pertinency of some at least of the questions petitioner refused to answer, the first eight of which were pertinent on their face to the subject of communist infiltration into news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.305" offset="10536626">Now, petitioner contends that even if the subject under inquiry was as I have described it, he was not apprised to the subject or on the pertinency of the questions to that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.746" offset="10582392">In the first place, this contention is not open to the petitioner since he did not raise the issue of pertinency or the scope of the subject under inquiry at the hearing when the subcommittee could have corrected any deficiency in this regard that might have existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.433" offset="10653132">The general objection that the petitioner made to the authority of the subcommittee appears at page 1733 of the hearings and we submit that it is significantly less precise then the one that was involved in the Barenblatt case in which this Court held was insufficient to raise the question of pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.781" offset="10762533">All the statement that petitioner had in the hearings did was to raise in a general way the First Amendment point that counsel has argued here and that is that he was not obligated by the First Amendment to answer questions concerning other persons, but the -- as an objection to pertinency, we feel certain that under both Barenblatt and Deutch it was completely inadequate to express that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.541" offset="10889488">In any event, however, petitioner was plainly apprised both of the nature of the subject matter and of the pertinency of the questions to subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.568" offset="10933687">He was present at the start of the hearings on January 6th when he heard both the Chairman and Senator Hennings to make statements I've already referred to identifying the subject under inquiry as communist infiltration into news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.048" offset="10991574">He heard the witness ahead of him, a newsman, questioned on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.549" offset="11009546">His own prepared statement, the one I referred to at page 1733 in the hearings reflects his understanding that infiltration of the press was the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.730" offset="11054268">He ascribed the investigation as being, ?with reference to the beliefs, associations and activities of individuals, who are or have been connected with newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.772" offset="11102438">Here as in Barenblatt and -- and precisely the same reasons as in Barenblatt, the witness was plainly aware of the subject under inquiry and since a number of the questions including that involved in count 7, were pertinent on their face to the question of communist infiltration into the press, petitioner must be held to have been aware of their pertinency.</text>
