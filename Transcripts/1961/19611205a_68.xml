            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">James Francis Hill, Petitioner, versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.267" offset="132472">Mr. Reitz.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="curtis_r_reitz" startTime="12.291" stopTime="879.961">
            <label>Mr. Curtis R. Reitz</label>
            <text syncTime="12.291" offset="152534">If the Court please, the petitioner in this case is seeking relief from an illegal sentence imposed by a Federal District Court on June 4, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.157" offset="199973">He had been found guilty of transporting a stolen motor vehicle in interstate commerce and of transporting across state lines a person who had been kidnapped and held for ransom.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.892" offset="242918">The transcript of what transpired at the sentencing proceeding is in the record of page 18 and is the core of this case, beginning about two-thirds of the way down the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.734" offset="302268">It's quite brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.784" offset="318464">First, the court said, does the Government cared to say anything, this was following the conviction and counsel for the Government said that he did not care to make a statement that the character of the defendant and his other crimes had been developed in proof during the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.581" offset="413654">The court then inquired whether his memory was correct as to the disposition of other -- of the defendants in these cases and the counsel for the Government replied that the one defendant had received the15-year sentence and a 2-year sentence and the -- that a minor had received a smaller sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.295" offset="496515">The Court said, that's the way I remembered it, and they are found on page 19 of the record without any further inquiry, the Court proceeded to impose sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.785" offset="538520">Specifically, the Court did not inquire of the defendant whether he wanted to make a statement in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.320" offset="572688">He did not inquire whether the defendant wished to present any information in litigation of the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.365" offset="596825">Nor did they make any such inquiries of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.834" offset="606751">There were absolutely no questions at all in the record which would constitute a compliance of Rule 32 (a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure which is the underlying rule in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.710" offset="658160">The rule which is in petitioner's brief on page 2 states the relevant portion of the second sentence of 32 (a), “before imposing sentence, the Court shall afford the defendant an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information for litigation and punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.122" offset="759829">In light of this Court's decision last term in Green versus United States, it is plain on the face of the record that there has been a violation of Rule 32 (a) and that point, I may say, is not in contest any longer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.838" offset="822732">The Government now concedes in this Court for the first time that there has been a violation of Rule 32 (a) in the treatment of the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.762" offset="866408">In the lower courts, the Government took precisely the opposite position.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.010" offset="887411">The case now comes before the Court of course in a petition for collateral relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.697" offset="910190">On October 21, 1959, petitioner filed a motion to vacate the sentences based upon several grounds and that motion is in the record at page 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.331" offset="964733">The District Court summarily denied the motion without any proceedings whatsoever, writing an opinion which is found on page 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.901" offset="1014993">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed in the brief per curiam opinion and then this Court granted certiorari limited, however, to a specific question whether petitioner may raise his claim under the Federal Criminal Rule 32 (a) in the proceeding he has now brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.290" offset="1096495">The other issues which were raised by petitioner in his motion for relief are therefore not presently relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.435" offset="1137142">In a sense, I suppose, this case is a continuation of where the Green case left off last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.108" offset="1163786">The Court then did not have to decide whether or not collateral relief was available in the case was a violation of 32 (a) because on the facts, four members of the Court found that 32 (a) had been complied with and Mr. Justice Stewart was of the opinion that the rule should have prospective operation only in requiring a specific question addressed to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.261" offset="1284368">So the question now before the Court in view of the clear, plain violation of 32 (a) is the one not decided in Green which is whether a collateral remedy is available for this violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.965" offset="1355212">In raising this question, petitioner sought relief under Section 2255 of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.595" offset="1397739">At the present time, I would like first to argue that he is entitled to relief under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.116" offset="1443819">The Government does not challenge the possibility of interchanging the remedy at this stage and I will explain later why I think it is perhaps important to the defendant that this be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.350" offset="1496795">Rule 35 provides, and it's on page 2 of petitioner's brief, the Court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.100" offset="1539741">The Green case, the Court will recall, was specifically raised under Rule 35 and decided in light of that rule and the question now relevant is whether or not this is an illegal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.034" offset="1607555">We are dealing of course with a rule of procedure in this case, a procedure set forth by Rule 32 (a) with respect to sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.534" offset="1657501">One of the remarkable things about the administration of criminal law generally in the last few years is the recognition long overdue, I may say, of the importance of the procedure of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.251" offset="1716328">We have a great body of law which deals with the procedures surrounding the trial of the issue of guilt or innocence, but we have virtually no procedures at present which deal with sentencing as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.193" offset="1780172">This is remarkable in light of the fact that more than 90% of the defendants who appear in criminal court, in a federal criminal court and are convicted, do so on a guilty plea so that the only real judicial function in the great majority of cases is the function of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.350" offset="1868779">The issues of guilt are foreclosed by the plea of guilty and the only thing which the judge really learns about the defendant is learn in the course of imposing sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.879" offset="1942862">The only provision in the rules as presently devised which offer the defendant any right whatsoever in connection with the procedure of sentencing is Rule 32 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="474.589" offset="2001690">The Government has taken the position that this is a nice rule, a rule of sound practice, but one which can be dispensed with without any great harm to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.794" offset="2058533">Petitioner takes exactly the opposite position that for most defendants, this is the single most important rule in the entire set of federal criminal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.815" offset="2114644">There are of course procedural rules which we might call housekeeping rules, which simply provide for a settled order a way of conducting the proceedings of the trial which are not terribly important and which can perhaps be dispensed with without great harm to the litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.200" offset="2216208">On the other hand, there are procedural rules such as Rule 32 (a) which have underlying and powerful reasons of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.994" offset="2259362">There were several such rules in the body of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.456" offset="2281200">Rule 11 and Rule 44 are rules which specifically reflect constitutional rights of a person accused of crime and in their own way they provide a procedural setting for vindicating those constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.019" offset="2363434">I would suggest to the Court that Rule 32 (a) is of similar vintage.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.609" offset="2385795">This is apparent in the first place on the face of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.226" offset="2400319">This Court in adopting the Rules of Criminal Procedure did so with great care and study and there were -- there was of course the advisory committee which worked for the Court and with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.303" offset="2448593">There were two preliminary drafts which were published, commented on by the bar and there's of course the final draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.640" offset="2481925">The language of Rule 32 (a), I'd like to point out to you, contains the unique requirement of imposing upon the trial judge the obligation to initiate a procedural move for the protection of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.872" offset="2550888">That is done in very few instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.402" offset="2561024">It is done in Rule 11 where the court is obliged to undertake an inquiry to determine whether or not a plea of guilty is voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.909" offset="2603029">It is also in Rule 44 where the court is obliged to advise the defendant of his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.659" offset="2633958">It is also in Rule 32 (a) where the court is obliged to afford the defendant an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information and litigation or punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.394" offset="2696965">In this case itself, I think we have dramatic illustration of why this right is so very important to a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.757" offset="2730402">One of the charges against the petitioner was of course kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.344" offset="2748792">On the kidnapping charge, the petitioner could have received as a sentence following conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.141" offset="2779930">He could have received probation, no imprisonment at all or in terms of the statute, he could have received any term of years for life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.401" offset="2824965">The range of punishment open to the Court on conviction in this case ran from zero years to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.919" offset="2863000">This is a remarkable, a dramatic change from the situation which existed at the common law where the court at the time of sentencing had virtually no discretion at all with respect to the punishment to be imposed upon the convicted defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.432" offset="2933112">It has been said and this Court said in the Green case that the sentence of Rule 32 (a) here relevant derives from and is a modern equivalent of the common law right of allocution.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.296" offset="3000508">I would suggest to the Court, it's a little more than that, and a lot more than that because the common law right of allocution protected only a very few incidents of the defendant's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.573" offset="3057664">A defendant in response to the allocution from the court, the allocatus, could raise only a few possible reasons why sentences should not be imposed, and for the most part, it was an all or nothing proposition, no attempt to influence the court in exercising any discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.343" offset="3132792">A defendant could say that he had been pardoned and if that were true, no sentence could be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.465" offset="3157243">The defendant could show that he was insane and had become insane since conviction, a rare incident, I'm sure in that case sentence could not be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.711" offset="3206248">The defendant could show that he was not the same person who had been convicted, that there was a change in identity somehow between the conviction in the sentence and this would prevent sentence or in a capital case, a woman who had been convicted of a capital crime could show that she was pregnant, in which case, she could not be executed while she was pregnant, but all of these reasons which pretty much sum up the entirety of common law right of allocution went to whether or not sentence could be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.515" offset="3349400">Of course, today, the sentencing process has become a discretionary process where as in this case, an enormously wide range of punishment from which the judge must select.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.939" offset="3399137">On conviction, there is no indication into which range of punishments, any particular defendant goes and our modern theory of punishment discussed by this Court very well in the Williams case, Williams versus New York, is turning more and more towards individualization of punishment so that it becomes more and more important that the court be informed of the relevant facts going to punishment and this, more so, I suggest in the common law right of allocution, is what underlies Rule 32 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="860.208" offset="3544168">It is the only means offered to the defendant to participate in informing the Court of what is relevant in the choice of his sentence and it is for this reason, as I say, perhaps the single most important rule in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as they stand today.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.487" offset="3817305">It was instituted in the lower courts as a motion under Section 2255, yes sir and I am suggesting to the Court now that it'd be treated as a Rule 35 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.643" offset="3865893">Perhaps I'd better deal with that at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.141" offset="3883969">The Government's position on Rule 35, I find it difficult to understand the -- it would appear that the Government finds Rule 35 totally swallowed up by Section 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.605" offset="3961814">Both of these remedies came into existence at approximately the same time, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure with Rule 35 was enacted in its present form in 1946, or promulgated in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.258" offset="4028374">Section 2255 came into the Judicial Code in 1948 as a part of the revision process, but the prior legislative work on both the rule and the statutory remedy were running concurrently from the early 1940s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.211" offset="4116250">To say that Rule 35 and Section 2255 cover identical materials, or in the Government's words that Rule 35 is a more narrow version of the remedy available under Section 2255 is to deprive the rule of all possible reason for being and this is almost belied by the fact that these two remedies were brought into the legal realm at almost identical moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.818" offset="4250624">The position I would urge this Court to take and I will say this, there has been a great deal of confusion as to the scope of both of these remedies in prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.889" offset="4306944">The position that I urge the Court to take is that Rule 35 is limited exclusively to defects in sentencing whereas Section 2255 is much broader and goes to all those defects which could upset the conviction itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.897" offset="4399000">Now, this is a very important point because it bears heavily on what happens as a result of granting relief and therefore bears heavily on the scope of the remedy which is desirable in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.222" offset="4456260">I would suggest that Rule 35 be limited to those situations in which the only remedy sought is a re-sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.922" offset="4495026">In any instance in which the remedy sought would require a retrial, the appropriate remedy would be Section 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.675" offset="4538075">In this way, both of these rules would have an area of independent operation and it would be possible to conceive of a remedy in Rule 35, contrary to the Government, being much broader than the kind of remedy permissible under Section 2255 because society has a rightful interest in not unnecessarily upsetting convictions of long standing and there is no statute of limitations in the implication of either of these remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.115" offset="4663881">It is possible to upset a conviction under the present rules regardless of how long it was obtained, in which case, simply through the passage of time, it would probably impossible in many situations to obtain a new conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.551" offset="4733576">The only remedy being sought by the prisoner in this case, however, is the right to have a legal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.655" offset="4765968">In the present posture of the case petitioner concedes the validity of this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.907" offset="4791045">There's no issue open on which he could say otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.745" offset="4806301">All he is seeking is the right to have a legal sentence imposed in strict conformity to his right under Rule 32 (a) to inform the Court on those factors which are relevant to his sentence, a right which he had been totally deprived of on the record at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.105" offset="4907760">The Government has taken a further position as to Rule 35 which it seems to me is wholly untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.407" offset="4940988">Now perhaps this is their main argument, I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.975" offset="4955303">The Government argues that Rule 35 is available only for errors which appear on the face of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.031" offset="4991457">That has never been decided in exactly those terms by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.627" offset="5013922">By the record, the Government means, however, not what we would expect the record to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.182" offset="5040149">They mean the equivalent of the common law judgment rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.908" offset="5058957">Now of course at the common law, this was the whole record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.236" offset="5072332">There were no other records kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.875" offset="5094902">The argument concerning the judgment role was heard regularly in proceedings for habeas corpus relief in the last century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.155" offset="5131995">Traditionally, of course, the writ of habeas corpus itself in the case of an attack upon a conviction would lie only for errors that appear on the face of the judgment rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.417" offset="5173060">As long ago as 1873, however, this Court rejected that argument in a habeas corpus case, Ex parte Lange and held that the record kept by modern courts went beyond the judgment rule and in that case, the Court employed the minute book which is kept by trial court's entering as the beginning of the record in both of these cases shows the docket entries, the minutes of the court at the various stages along the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.763" offset="5286431">This minute book was of course a form of record totally unknown at the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.687" offset="5322167">The Government's argument actually runs directly counter to what this Court did in the Green case where the – apart from Mr. Justice Stewart, the Court divided exactly on how to read the transcript of sentence which is not a part of the common law judgment rule, never has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.207" offset="5392175">What the Government has overlooked is the Court Reporter's Act, adopted in 1944 which makes it mandatory in every criminal case to have a transcript prepared of the arraignment and sentencing proceedings, regardless of whether anything else is transcribed, the reporter must take the notes and transcribe the full proceedings of arraignment and sentencing and this is made the part of the record in this case, in every criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.631" offset="5509935">That statute is Section 753 of the Judicial Code and I have quoted the relevant portions of it on page 8 of the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.225" offset="5556224">There may be sound reasons for not allowing a motion under Rule 35 to require extrinsic evidence for resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.079" offset="5611708">The Government is plainly wrong, however, in suggesting that such requirement could ever arise if Rule 35 is used to inquire in the compliance with Rule 32 (a) because the record in every case of what actually took place in the courtroom must be a part of the record and was a part of the record in this case even though the Government was unaware of it until the court -- until the case arrived in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.273" offset="5724453">Therefore, I suggest to the Court that granting relief in this case could not possibly lead to a requirement of a factual inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.844" offset="5758725">It is simply a matter of looking at the record as this Court did in the Green case with a difficult case on the facts in Green case and deciding whether or not Rule 32 (a) has been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.121" offset="5807835">There is nothing in the way of inconvenience to the Government or even inconvenience to the Court in making such an inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.112" offset="5843780">It's quite simple, quite expeditious and it's over with rather quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.107" offset="5879829">Of course, if the Court should determine that Rule 35 is not an appropriate remedy in this case for some reason, petitioner would still revert back to his claim for relief under Section 2255 of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.171" offset="5960077">I don't think that as far as the scope of the remedy under Section 2255, that petitioner and the Government are really in disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.356" offset="6000828">I think we both agree that a post-conviction remedy which opens up factual inquiries, which opens up the possibility of upsetting a conviction of many years standing, such a remedy has to be limited to those errors which are of the greatest importance in the administration of criminal law and this has always been true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.581" offset="6105736">The original writ of habeas corpus inquired only into the bare competence of the Court which at that time was thought to be the only way which was entitled to post-conviction vindication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.225" offset="6172296">Over the past century, as this Court is well aware, the scope of habeas corpus has grown enormously in criminal law and I submit that growth process ought not to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.292" offset="6224541">The Government I think has taken on a false issue by arguing to this Court that Section 2255 is no broader than habeas corpus and then looking at habeas corpus as it was defined in the 19th Century where they find exactly two cases dealing with sentencing, and therefore it follows in their logic that there's no remedy under Section 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.297" offset="6324537">The first difficulty with the argument of course is that the habeas corpus cases they find are 19th Century cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.232" offset="6356302">The Government did not even find for example that habeas corpus would protect a right of a prisoner to be present at his own sentencing simply because there was no case in this Court so holding in the 19th Century but that right is obviously one which would be protected by post-conviction relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.617" offset="6425788">Nor did the Government find that habeas corpus would protect the right of a defendant to have counsel in sentencing, there were just no such cases decided by this Court in the 19th Century, but these rights, procedural rights are obviously fundamental and important to the defendant and would obviously have been protected by this Court under habeas corpus, are being protected by lower courts under Section 2255 and deal with sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.514" offset="6969448">I would suggest to the Court therefore that primarily, petitioner is entitled to relief under Rule 35, the rule which explicitly and purposely deals with sentencing and a rule which by virtue of its necessary limitations does not have to be as narrow in scope as the broader, the more general post-conviction remedy under Section 2255, but that in any event, petitioner has an important, a fundamental right applying to the very core of the case against him which ought to be vindicated even under Section 2255.</text>

            <text syncTime="2213.852" offset="8958830">The Government agrees that in neither the case of the petitioner here nor in the companion case of the petitioner (Inaudible) have there been compliance with Rule 32 (a) as this Court has interpreted that rule in Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.462" offset="9033226">We say however that the error is not one properly before the Court on collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.564" offset="9069589">Now at the outset, may I again pinpoint the error with which we are concerned?</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.335" offset="9104697">As noted in the Green case, the right embodied in Rule 32 (a) had its beginning in the old English law, practice of allocution, arising at a time when a person accused of a felony was not permitted to have counsel to represent him and there was a formal inquiry was put to him, do you John Jones have any reason to say as to why sentence should not be pronounced against you and in answer to that, the person accused of the felony could answer not only to matters and arrest the judgment but also as to a plea in mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.019" offset="9287450">Now the issue in Green was whether this formal inquiry was mandatory in light of present day procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.068" offset="9327679">The Government argued in that case that it was not, although it might be the better practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.124" offset="9351920">This Court rejected the contention of the Government that inquiry to counsel met the requirements of the rule since it said the need still existed for a person being sentenced to personally present his plea in mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.866" offset="9442826">It did not decide, we do not think whether noncompliance with a literal concept of the formal allocution that is the putting of this formal inquiry would per se result in an illegal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.452" offset="9525164">The position of the Government is that the omission of this formal inquiry by its very nature is subject to correction only by direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.898" offset="9578977">We say that it is not an error of the scope, of the magnitude, or other character that is subject to correction perhaps years after sentencing either by a writ of habeas corpus or by motion to vacate sentence under Section 2255 or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.090" offset="9695692">Now, I won't take too much at the outset about habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.021" offset="9727457">Although the petitioner in his brief impliedly conceded that we think that he could not invoke the great writ of habeas corpus, since an oral argument Mr. Reitz relies primarily on Rule 35, I will only say one or two things at the outset with reference to the collateral attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="2595.529" offset="10485530">The scope of collateral relief was comprehensively discussed by this Court in Sunal versus Large and I think that that case is still void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.237" offset="10528371">That case recited the cardinal principle that the -- that was a habeas corpus case that the writ of habeas corpus would not do service for an appeal except in exceptional circumstances or as dissenting members of this Court put it in Sunal, the writ will lie in lieu of an appeal only to prevent a complete miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.382" offset="10656893">Now, the error with which we are presently concerned is not just that kind of an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.029" offset="10683538">It raises no jurisdictional problem, thus, the facts show the contrast we think with those errors in sentencing which do raise jurisdictional problems, such sentences for example as those which exceed the maximum provided by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.713" offset="10782177">Moreover, the error here is one which is known and is capable of being raised on appeal and we do not think it presents those exceptional circumstances as would warrant a departure from the cardinal rule that the proper way of correcting errors is by appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.384" offset="10868903">We do not think it remotely approaches for example in seriousness the error which was considered in Sunal versus Large.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.876" offset="11462928">Your Honor, we start off with the propositions certainly that we think as to scope, Rule 35 is narrower in this sense that there were few questions that should be raised under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.967" offset="11543280">The Rule we say is available only to correct an illegal sentence, and what the petitioner Hill is asking here is not to correct an illegal sentence but to have an erroneous submission in the sentencing procedure rectified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.638" offset="11633873">We say that an illegal sentence within the meaning of Rule 35 is one which on its face does not for some reason conform to the letter of the statute which authorized it and we think that the decisions and the history of the Rule support this construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.772" offset="11714435">For example, this Court we do not think has held to date at its -- that Rule 35 is applicable to a sentence which is not illegal per se on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.584" offset="11789667">Now, we might consider initially the -- quite apart from being considered, initially the recent cases which had come before this Court in which Rule 35 has been found to applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.026" offset="11827493">There is the case of Heflin versus United States in which the issue is whether consecutive sentences could be imposed on the bank robbery statute for feloniously receiving in taking the same property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.906" offset="11879006">The court, this Court thought Rule 35 was available since the sentence imposed was “illegal on its face.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.822" offset="11934699">I might also call your attention to Callanan versus United States to Holiday versus Johnston and to Prince versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.422" offset="11977017">They were all cases where this issue of the pyramiding of penalties was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.154" offset="12012022">In Morgan versus United States, this Court noted that Rule 35 was not available to correct a claim denying of the right to counsel since and the Court said sentences subject to correction under that rule are those which the judgment of conviction did not authorize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.077" offset="12115675">Now, Rule 35 promulgated in 1946 continued the existing law and the law at that time was that a Federal District Court could not correct its judgments after term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.969" offset="12183280">Now this was a pronouncement of this Court in the early case of United States versus Meyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.192" offset="12208149">Now, the lower court decisions following the Meyer case held that there were two exceptions or there were several exceptions to this rule of no alteration after term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.554" offset="12249631">These exceptions were that a court could after alteration of term correct for clerical mistakes and for illegal sentences and the illegal sentence as would appear from the review of the cases was a sentence which either exceeded the maximum provided by statute or the sentence which imposed to sentences for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.488" offset="12369272">And as Mr. Justice Stewart noted in the concurring opinion in Heflin, Rule 35 codified this existing law and it was intended to remove any doubt that a Federal District Court could correct an illegal sentence after expiration of term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.989" offset="12439280">We do not think that the rule enlarged the scope of illegality as it has been existent, and the scope of legality we say did not include this type of error with which we are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.108" offset="12511796">And may I say in this regard that this is just not a matter of -- we just can't stop and say this is just a matter of recalling a prisoner for re-sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.771" offset="12554428">The issue here is not quite that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.711" offset="12570206">Granted that the purpose of allocution is to permit the prisoner to speak, to speak himself or I might inevidently put it, to speak his piece, but we can't stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.991" offset="12627362">The only purpose of speaking is to influence, or invoke the leniency of the sentencing judge and the discretionary manner of sentencing, and a court of course does not exercise its discretion solely on the basis of matters urged by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.041" offset="12731538">There may be many other considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.694" offset="12738121">There may be evidentiary considerations, the seriousness of the crime, the aggravated circumstances under which it was committed, the prior record, the defendant's conduct even at the time when he is brought before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.935" offset="12803114">And so it is reasonable to assume therefore that if this Court found that allocutions could be raised collaterally under either of the motions of Rule 35 or 2255 that whether prisoner may be recalled before a court which did not originally sentence him or where time as though the memory of the sentencing court that a perusal of the entire record might be necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.333" offset="13288678">So I would say that they're not merely considerations here of transporting back for re-sentencing in many instances from long distances, but there is a very real consideration of economy, of judicial time and procedure and while these considerations would not be significant if they were balanced against a deprivation of personal liberty, the omission of allocution we say such a deprivation of personal liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.375" offset="13448861">We pointed out raising of jurisdictional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.324" offset="13468714">It has no constitutional implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.671" offset="13482088">As I've said it derived from common law practice and in lieu of present day judicial procedure where in many instances there is a pre-sentence report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.817" offset="13530676">The accused is represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.381" offset="13540916">It could hardly result in a deprivation of personal liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.175" offset="13564113">One final word, Rule 32 (a) we think can be distinguished from those few rules of federal criminal procedure which do restate basic fundamental constitutional rights and therefore may probably be the subject of collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.305" offset="13652616">Such a rule might be Rule 43 which requires the presence of a defendant in every stage of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.566" offset="13681664">An interesting comparison here could be made with Rule 10 which protects the right of an accused to be present, to be arraigned in open court and to be informed to the nature and acquisition of the case against him and yet the courts in Fifth, Tenth, Second and Eighth Circuits relying in this Court's opinion in Garland versus Washington has held that literal non-compliance with Rule 10 is not a jurisdictional defect which can be raised collaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.112" offset="13827845">This Court in the Garland case held that arraignment and plea are not essential to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.996" offset="13867342">And finally, may I reemphasize that a prisoner asking for the formality of allocution in a collateral proceeding under Rule 35 or Section 2255 is asking for more than the believed right to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.474" offset="13925230">He's asking the court perhaps years after sentencing, perhaps of a court totally unfamiliar with the case to exercise discretion anew in reimposing sentence with all the attending difficulties on the basis of facts which could have been erred to the time of appeal and which might have been before the Court at the time of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.482" offset="14025331">We respectfully submit that this right should not be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.051" offset="14043617">Thank you.</text>
