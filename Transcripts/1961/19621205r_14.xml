            <label>Mr. Hubert D. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="25.158" offset="204048">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.009" offset="231424">These cases where number 14 and number 15 were consolidated in this Court's original October 1961 order, were argued in February 28 and 29, consolidated and -- or here again today in that shape.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.331" offset="312717">The cases come from judgment of the Texas Supreme Court hereby appeal through the root provided, we believe, under 28 U.S.C. Section 1257 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="77.200" offset="412191">The cases in each case, National Banks located in Dallas where their sole offices in Dallas had been sued in -- as one of two of 144 defendants according to the pleading, in a state court, State District Court in Travis County, Austin, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.398" offset="516995">For information of non-Texan that's approximately 200 miles from Dallas and that Austin is right on the very center of the State, Dallas is a little bit north there.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.785" offset="558477">The -- most of this record is comprised of the rather lengthy pleading which was the suit itself or the allegations are made by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.943" offset="607169">The plaintiff was the receiver appointed by the Court of an insolvent insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.390" offset="636949">He also is a -- an official as provided for by state law and only as the statutory liquidator.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.278" offset="660459">And by the state law he becomes the receiver by appointment of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.486" offset="681357">Each of the banks promptly filed what we call a plea of privilege under Texas practice which is the method of setting up the assertion of the venue right.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.257" offset="736423">Each set up by -- for itself as it had to under Texas practice its right to have the cause transferred as to it -- to its home county there in Dallas County.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.716" offset="786265">The only place where it's established and the only place that it does have a place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.517" offset="801416">We don't have a branch office problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.675" offset="810088">Texas is -- did not have branch banking and that's there -- was their only office.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.478" offset="833285">The venue issue is set for separate trial as is provided for under state practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.420" offset="861080">We've attached to our briefs the -- two practice rules that govern it.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.575" offset="893680">Each of the venue claims or pleas of privilege were controverted by the receiver and a hearing was held, actually hearings, although when it developed that there are really no fact issues that it was basically a stipulated matter in the law issue, they were held consolidatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.993" offset="971316">Orders entered in each case denying the pleas of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.284" offset="992528">Then each of the defendants took its appeal to the Austin Court of Civil Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.483" offset="1021262">Each had to decide then under state court practice whether it would appeal or not appeal because if it did not do so, the matter was closed under state practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.227" offset="1064312">The Austin Court of Civil Appeals had before it the case, both the cases, a stipulation that the only issue involved was this legal issue of whether the provision of the National Bank Act of 1864 origination gave the National Banks this venue right notwithstanding a venue right that the receiver, plaintiff had conferred on him by 1955 Texas statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.845" offset="1194715">The Austin Court of Civil Appeals said that the trial court had erred in these cases and then ordered the cases transferred and the appeal then went to the Texas Supreme Court and it said, “No, the Austin Court of Civil Appeals had not erred.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.105" offset="1267754">The time for motion of rehearing filed overruled, were through in Texas”.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.043" offset="1299519">This Court in its October order noted that the question of jurisdiction was carried forward to consideration along with the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.336" offset="1336717">The casebooks tell me that that's a warning to me, that I better come prepared to talk about jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.342" offset="1364720">I talk some about it before and I want to talk some more about it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.954" offset="1383215">If I can't get in here what the rest of the questions involved, that would make much difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.243" offset="1404322">I have before in the period of time when we are preparing our notice of appeal, we made a -- what we think is a very careful study.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.356" offset="1440789">We have followed it up thereafter and we have devoted the substantial part of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.267" offset="1464404">Better than half of it, as I recall, to this jurisdiction question, a jurisdiction question.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.532" offset="1501497">First has in it the aspect of finality of the matter as far as the state court is concerned, the state practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.072" offset="1535666">We have cited case in here, the Supreme Court of Texas case that I think is contained at page 16 of our brief is which it all falls in SR Company v. McDonald which announces a number of rules that might not be the practice everywhere on a venue right but they are the practice in the law in Texas and they make it beyond -- clear beyond peradventure that we had to appeal from the judgment of the trial court unless we wanted to acquiescent that we could not sit back and bring the matter up again.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.302" offset="1708596">In that Wichita Falls Railroad case, in fact, that's just exactly what have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.284" offset="1728554">In July, one term of the court, the trial court had overruled a plea of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.284" offset="1756557">Later in November at another term of the court, the defendant who had asserted the plea of privilege had the temerity to say, let's reconsider this.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.456" offset="1797204">And he had -- he is more persuasive the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.019" offset="1807444">The trial court then said, “Alright, we'll transfer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.733" offset="1822281">We'd already transferred it.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.664" offset="1826043">I grant you plea of privilege”.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.380" offset="1832939">The appellate courts pointed out to him that he could not do that, that this was a separate trial that it granted that it had certain interlocutory phases, he would not lack a ruling on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.603" offset="1885811">There is not enough lack of ruling that could be carried forward if this had -- the time to appeal was now, that it not haven't been appealed from, and that the order attempting to make the transfer was void.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.168" offset="1936071">And I don't think that the appellee disagrees with me in the slightest as to what Wichita Falls Railroad Company versus McDonald said.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.275" offset="1968462">Now, I'm aware of the fact that that's what the Texas Court has said as to the finality of this phase of the case, this res judicata plea which is a basic element of finality is fully recognized in Texas and we've -- this case was not the first case it so held is, it was the most recent one in Texas and it is more or less the keystone case that we all cite.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hubert D. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="543.616" offset="2277857">-- individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.673" offset="2282036">Involved questions -- it would appear both state law and common law principles as to the pleading as a typical transitory tort action for a lot of money, the $15 million bond which even in their own ways is a lot of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.347" offset="2368763">The -- so we began to look at these cases in this Court that have gone -- that have interpreted this meaning of final judgment as in 1257 (2), also as in 1391 which relates to the final decisions of district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.375" offset="2452877">In our federal district courts, they do have an area there for appeals from certain types of specified interlocutory orders but if you don't come within one of those then you have to get in this final category.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.120" offset="2499897">That led us to the decision of this case, this Court in the Cohen versus Beneficial Industrial Corporation in, I believe, it's 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.032" offset="2547545">And frankly, that case intrigued us and we have tried to apply every analysis that we could to it as to why this case might or might not come within the purview of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.151" offset="2612015">And we frankly believe that this case does come within the -- what the Court describe as a small class of case that was dealt with in the Cohen-Beneficial Industrial case.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.113" offset="2679829">As you probably recall in that, that was a suit by minority stockholders in a Federal District Court in the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.600" offset="2713788">After the case had been filed, New Jersey adopted a statute which gave the defendant corporation, under certain circumstances, the right to require security for cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.673" offset="2774079">The statute said that it applied to pending actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.069" offset="2791633">The defendant corporation moved to have the cost bond made, the security for cost made and the trial court denied it, primarily based apparently on a theory that the New Jersey statute was not intended to be applied in an action in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.084" offset="2871672">There was some Erie Railway versus Tompkins problems in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.210" offset="2892257">And at that point, having denied it, the corporation is faced with the question of, can we go up now or do we have to wait and have this trial happen to us without security and then come up?</text>
            <text syncTime="710.904" offset="2947009">Is this the final decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="712.476" offset="2953279">It's not one of those interlocutory types that are covered by Section 1291 or 1292 that deals with certain types of injunction receivership orders that can be appealed from as -- even though they are interlocutory orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.936" offset="3019107">The Circuit Court held that it could entertain jurisdiction and held that the trial court had erred that this statute should have been applied in the federal court and this Court took the case and coming at considerable length and discuss in great detail the appealability or jurisdictional aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.993" offset="3107297">Apparently, there really weren't any disagreement among the court on that part.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.799" offset="3118582">There was a disagreement, a dissent as to whether or not the New Jersey statute was such a statute that should be applied in the federal court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.312" offset="3156616">But as far as the explanations and the discussions are concerned, we have excerpted in our brief and in the appendix the total portion of the opinion on appealability and we've tried to subject the present case to an analysis as to each of the factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.222" offset="3240312">And frankly, we were prejudiced, I will admit, in what we hope was the answer but we feel like ‘it fits to a T' and we feel that actually in some measure, this one is even more demanding of it because here, we have a situation where beyond peradventure, the issue is not even subject to review fully by the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.100" offset="3347728">Now, I don't get the feeling in the Cohen case that if the federal district judge had decided to change his mind 90 days later on whether he would require security for cost -- give security for cost that the Court would have been powerless to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.068" offset="3415646">There wasn't any inclination that he was going to.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.168" offset="3428080">And so actually, from that -- in that standpoint, we have a more permanent and irrevocable finality established by virtue of the peculiar state court practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.249" offset="3484400">Now, you can say, “Well, that's state court practice and we're not governed by that”.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.726" offset="3502268">But we're in the state court and we have to deal with our rights with reference to what the state court does with them and I don't -- we don't feel that we have a complete immunity from those rules with respect to timeliness of appeal and preservation of our rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.136" offset="3579904">It was a good deal of discussion here the last time about -- well what if this -- we don't entertain jurisdiction and this matter is saved and brought up again, where will it would be? Certainly, the state court by its own determination will not consider the venue matter again.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.279" offset="3656495">When it -- that circumstance should happen, if it should happen and we come up here again, we'll have kind of an odd situation in which the last state court action on it took place a year or so before.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.777" offset="3710516">And I think someone commented before that there would be a good deal to unscramble at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.096" offset="3739773">Now, the appellee before is taking the position and I think probably would now that actually they would like to have this question settled, realizing, however, that this Court's jurisdiction can't be conferred by what my opponents would like or what I would like and that I have this burden of showing that this Court does have jurisdiction, I believe that it does.</text>

            <text syncTime="933.945" offset="3839143">But you -- you got another -- I take a very favorable view of Cohen too because I represented the prevailing party in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.307" offset="3884596">And that is when you come to the merits of this case, I suppose the underlying premise of your argument would be that Congress intended to protect these banks, national banks by reason of this venue statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="971.032" offset="3987519">-- is about too late to effectively review about the fact that if they didn't get the right to see whether they could have security for cost until after they had already incurred the cost, it'd be somewhat late or really quite strikingly apt here.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.985" offset="4047287">They're quite a bit like, Mr. Justice Frankfurter's comments in the Swift &amp; Company attachment case where the attachment was vacated which is a case that's cited and followed the Cohen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.840" offset="4098696">And he said that appellate review of this order at a later date after the -- it would be an empty right after the vessel had been released in the restoration of the attachment only theoretically possible that it is somewhat the situation we ought to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.208" offset="4176227">If we go to trial in Austin, and it's later determined that we weren't required to go there, it'll be kind of apparent victory to find it out that time goes -- it would have already happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.929" offset="4223039">And neither this law means, we don't have to be tried twice there, I don't know but seriously, that feature of the Cohen case is certainly quite appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.939" offset="4271104">Now, we've done the best we could to check the comparable statutes in the cases under 1257 dealing with appeals coming up from state court system in the state and the cases that come up from the other side, from the federal side and we haven't been able to find any reason for arriving at different standards on this area of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.584" offset="4377684">In Radio Station WOW versus Johnson and there was some discussion of that but that was an accounting work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.791" offset="4406523">And one issue had been decided but it was still accounting and the Court went ahead and heard the concluded issue of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.973" offset="4447274">The cases are numerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.474" offset="4453230">I think we have cited most of them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.563" offset="4461589">We think we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.700" offset="4470157">The Montgomery Trade Council case, which is sometimes cited for the opposite position, involved the temporary injunction in Alabama, but there they had the -- you were faced with the old rule of Gibbons versus Ogden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.355" offset="4536822">It said that the temporary injunction was continuing in the (Inaudible) of the Court and that it might very well take it up at anytime and that it was in contemplation of a hearing on a permanent injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.005" offset="4587395">And -- but the -- I'll cite that case because the dissent which felt that the real issue there was the power of the state court to interfere in the merits that was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act which I think pretty well have been settled later on but at that time, it was still a crying issue was really what has been involved and if that had been decided very finely, and it took a comment on the fact that these things had to be given a practical rather than a technical construction and commented on the fact that there was no reason why you should have one standard that's going to the federal system of finality and another system when it's come up to the state court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.371" offset="4768893">Many of the cases that have come up to the state court system had been cases where the judgment of the Highest Supreme Court did not reverse the case or settled it, that it had effective remand and by operation, sometimes a state practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.626" offset="4829915">Some cases where there was something still yet to be done, a remittitur problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.677" offset="4854053">We don't think and we'd be the last to say that interlocutory orders per se should be brought before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.418" offset="4889057">The Texas case there again pointed out that this was no ordinary interlocutory order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.328" offset="4916642">The Cohen case points out that this is not only talking about opening the door to appeal some interlocutory orders generally, not talking about fragmentary review, piecemeal review, advisory opinions to guide the court, the trial court as it goes along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.384" offset="4988949">We are not here on that type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.822" offset="5006712">We believe that there is always ample precedent in the constructions of the statutes that govern this Court's jurisdiction to recognize jurisdiction in this case without stretching anything that has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.486" offset="5073272">That it does not call for a new exception at all, it calls for a recognition of an application of the Cohen rule as we call it and that type of thing which there again was not the first in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.779" offset="5142444">The accounting cases had come on long before the cases of that type where there still were things to be done in other aspects of the litigation but not related.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.292" offset="5408580">I think so and I will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.646" offset="5421955">The basic thing on which the national banks were basing their right was the provision of what was Section 57 of the National Bank Act of 1864 and it was carried forward as a part of Section 5198 of the revised statutes when they revised under the 1873 authorized revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.992" offset="5519339">And nowadays, you'll find it in 12 U.S.C. 94.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.184" offset="5540133">This 1940 edition at least carries it at that place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.829" offset="5562702">This statute is -- we think it's really quite clear on its face it -- the reading of it -- we set it out in full, doesn't seem that it ought not cause so much concern as to the construction of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.670" offset="5646085">It says, actions and proceedings against national banks maybe had in any district or territorial court of the United States held within the district in which such association may be established or in any state county or municipal court in the county or city in which such association is located having jurisdiction in similar cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.442" offset="5733125">Now, in our brief we've gone over all of the cases in this Court and few in some other courts that have construed this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.151" offset="5775966">The -- beginning with the Bethel case that involved a Connecticut proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.701" offset="5810134">The question of whether or not the Connecticut courts could entertain one against the national banks, they said that they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.889" offset="5834898">The Casey v. Adams which was a state court proceeding up from Louisiana's Highest Court held that -- with respect to the statute, it was not intended to apply to an interim action, a type of local action that there's been known there, as long as there'd been actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.225" offset="5928312">That being a peculiarly local action from the very description of it, the opinion is very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.370" offset="5948897">You can see that that was what was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.699" offset="5970213">The main case and the one that we think was being controlling and which we've based our rights was this First National Bank of Charlotte, North Carolina versus Morgan, that arose in the early 1880s and was decided in this Court in 1889 and it was a suit, in the state court in North Carolina where the bank was sued away from its home county but it didn't raise its rights until it -- he lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.686" offset="6094137">Then it raised its rights saying that there was complete lack of jurisdiction of the Court out in their outlying county where it had been heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.006" offset="6131440">The opinion in that case was written by the first Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.105" offset="6143770">Looks like I'm thinking on the Harlan cases a little bit, but that's the way the thing worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.741" offset="6166340">That opinion had occasion then to say, was this so jurisdictional that it could be raised for the first time in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.415" offset="6201031">What did the statute's proper right did it grant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.284" offset="6216495">And the Court said that it was not a jurisdiction statute, that it was a personal privilege which if it had been asserted, it must have been recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.592" offset="6257768">Now, that opinion is -- the opponents don't like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.254" offset="6280338">They say that it's a dictum because it didn't have to go so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.233" offset="6296325">But we think that they had then -- in saying what the statute was not, they said what it was, which is not an uncommon way of answering the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.629" offset="6333837">And the answer was already quite clear and it seems to us that if they hadn't said at least that much then the statute was totally and completely meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.343" offset="6376782">The state courts have gone off all around the clock on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.765" offset="6398412">They have said that it was a mere permissive thing, meaning that the Court could grant it if they wanted to or could not grant it if they didn't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.856" offset="6434774">They didn't -- well that's not much of a right and it doesn't mean anything if it says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.099" offset="6455777">If it just means that they may grant it or not as this trial court sees fit to do, then it wasn't worth having the statute about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.905" offset="6494960">And we have discussed that point and it's been discussed very thoroughly in a number of state courts and it had been discussed in a couple of Circuit Courts of Appeals cases but except by inference, it wasn't discussed here in the Morgan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.418" offset="6565073">It was saying that if it had been claimed, it must have been recognized which certainly is mandatory type of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.873" offset="6590882">In the Casey v. Adams, if it was just a main type of thing and they didn't need to go into the matter whether it was a local or a transitory action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.337" offset="6644694">The -- in 1923, in a case, Bank of America versus Whitney Central Bank, this Court did not have occasion to actually consider the matter because of the fact that from the brief in the case you can see that it was never asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.964" offset="6731212">The banks were claiming there that -- the bank there was claiming that it was not subject to process from the jurisdiction because it was not located there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.589" offset="6765693">By on this side, the Court said that if anybody had ever wanted to point out this other matter that even if they've been subject to process, it might have been that they would have been entitled to be sued in their home county, citing the Morgan case and the statutes on which it's based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.909" offset="6831000">Now, we've given a little bit of attention to the state court cases but nothing tremendous because they are confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.471" offset="6877288">Some of them have gone off on the theory that this has -- it referenced only to this limited type of action where a bank was being sued for the penalty for having charge usurious interest which apparently was based on the legislative coincidence that in the 1875 corrective act, they put back something that had been omitted and put it back at the last part of a section that had dealt with the penalty for charging usurious in -- for National Bank charging usurious interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.052" offset="7035591">But the language of the statute is quite clear that it refers to actions and proceedings against national banks, any one in this title and the whole title there is about national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.621" offset="7077804">That was not the rationale in the Morgan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.457" offset="7089194">It was not the rationale in the Casey v. Adams and it's been completely explained away by the Circuit Court of Appeals in this Leonardi case and in the Buffum case, true both of those are cases that involved proceedings filed in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.870" offset="7170800">But they're talking about the same statute and could have that limitation to usury claims in federal -- in state courts, it would have been the same thing for federal courts because the same problem was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.756" offset="7226389">That I think has been pretty well laid at rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.857" offset="7242794">Some of them had gone off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.692" offset="7250108">The cases had fall on the other category on the conclusion that this was a local action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.681" offset="7270066">Well, they had basis in those cases on Casey v. Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.530" offset="7285530">Casey v. Adams has not been overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.302" offset="7300577">It has not been expanded by this Court to cover more than the true interim proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.756" offset="7342373">The argument has been made in some of the cases -- been made in the briefs here by the appellee that there was a proviso to Section 4 of an Act in 1882 that partially or wholly repealed this Section 57 of the National Bank Act of the 1864 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.884" offset="7434951">We have addressed ourselves to that in some detail and in large upon what we had originally by a supplemental brief which we think shows beyond question that the 1882 proviso was directed exclusively at a jurisdiction problem that arose out of the amendment of the Judiciary Act in 1875 that gave general federal question jurisdiction in national banks having this federal origin status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.970" offset="7571205">We're therefore in a position to practically eliminate the concurrent state court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.460" offset="7597223">We cite four or five cases that have gone -- that had analyzed carefully this 1882 Act and its follow up Acts of 1887 and 1888 which have carried forward in the judiciary code in 1911 and then rewritten again in the Judiciary Code of 1948 which seems to us to thoroughly exhaust the subject and thoroughly establish what the statutory language itself established that it was addressed strictly to the matter of preventing this exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts because it was for all practical purposes exclusive as long as this free right of removal existed, that is if you have the $500 amount in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.186" offset="7796067">And that meant that this was a problem where the intention of giving any state court jurisdiction was being afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.683" offset="7830131">And that's all that that those -- that statute was about and the language of it shows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.981" offset="7855313">The cases of this Court over the next 25 years after it was passed show it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.455" offset="7881226">It has been discussed very, very carefully by this Court in the Petri case and in the Continental National Bank versus Buford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.097" offset="7915708">It was also discussed and noticed in the Van Reed versus People's Bank in 1905 which involved the matter of attachments issuing out of a state court against a national bank which had been a matter that was covered by Section 57 as it had been amended in 1873.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.224" offset="7996270">They were really into the same area there although it's true with a different point of impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.056" offset="8023646">But all those cases show, it seem to me, if so thoroughly develop the legislative purpose and intention of that as its language shows that frankly one of the reasons we didn't give it as much attention in the original brief was, we didn't think it was -- merited a great deal of attention but it had been the subject of good deal discussion here before so we thought maybe -- maybe it would be better to enlarged a little bit upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.331" offset="8136704">On this local action matter, there was an argument made here before to the fact that the state statute that created the insurance -- of the insurance code and particularly this section of the 1955 Act that gave this right of venue to the receiver in the county or in the court of competent jurisdiction where the delinquency proceeding is pending, was intended to create a local action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.185" offset="8252061">It did create a statutory local action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.379" offset="8272854">At that time, we said and we say again that Casey versus Adams, seems to us makes it quite clear that they're talking about what is really a local action and not one that it just labeled such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.347" offset="8328756">I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter rather after he pointed out that if you can just put the label on it, then they can just go back and amend the statute and say that any action we bring is the local action and therefore we've eliminated the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.933" offset="8383091">It's not that -- that shouldn't that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.442" offset="8397093">And so the label is not controlling but the truth of the matter is that there's nothing in the insurance code and nothing in this section that purported to create any action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.911" offset="8447039">It dealt with actions that arose out of transactions with the company before it went into receivership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.451" offset="8477132">This very pleading shows here that they're based on actions that go back to 1950 in a so-called grand conspiracy that's extended from 1950 to 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.368" offset="8524884">They're talking about a 1955 Act and the 1957 receivership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.885" offset="8554872">And it was not intended to be a local action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.647" offset="8569919">At that time, there was mention of the fact that there has been -- was pending in the Texas Supreme Court a case which would involve a construction whether this was a mandatory type of provision or what in this Section 4 (f) of Article 21.28 of the Insurance Code of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.433" offset="8641076">That case has since been decided, and that case and we quote from in our supplemental brief is Burke versus -- Burke Investment Company versus Langdeau.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.665" offset="8678066">And they point out there that it was a merely permissive, a place that the receiver could bring an action, not the place that he had to bring an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.148" offset="8715995">It's clear from that case that the receiver could bring an action against these national banks in a District State Court in Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.849" offset="8754761">It is clear that he could bring an action anywhere he wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.409" offset="8777017">He might have some of them changed under local rules of venue if these people had local rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.787" offset="8798542">This was not a must statute but the main thing I pointed out in that case was that in the discussion of it, in no way suggested that it had anything to do with the nature of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.977" offset="8847235">It's strictly pertains to venue and it was permissive at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.284" offset="8864475">They had a case there involving the -- where a land suit had been brought where the land was and the receiver said, “No, it has to be brought here where I am”, which one of them controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.844" offset="8918706">The 1955 when was later in time, if it was mandatory, perhaps it superseded the other and held that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.159" offset="8952038">Both of them are local venue statutes in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.878" offset="8966875">They're not concerned with the nature of the action really basically even in the land suit in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.754" offset="8994356">The party being sued has to set up this plea of privilege or else the Court has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.277" offset="9020479">The local action argument, we didn't think had too much before and in the light of what the Texas Supreme Court has said since then and which is covered in a supplemental brief, we think now it really completely falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.876" offset="9070843">I want to save some time for my -- the counsel in the other case to close and if there're no questions at this time, I'll relinquish that the appellee move.</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.145" offset="9131969">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.823" offset="9150673">First, with reference to the jurisdiction of this Court at this stage of this proceeding, from a very practical standpoint, of course the appellee would rather -- and prefers to have this matter of venue if that's what it is determined at this stage rather than to try the entire case which is of some size, and then have it reach this Court and be reversed and have to be retried again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.705" offset="9254222">That of course is the practical basis for the Texas statute that permits a direct appeal to the appellate courts in Texas from a trial court decision on venue so that that question maybe finally decided and it was finally decided in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.905" offset="9326947">Before, you try the case on the merits so that you don't try the case and then have to come back and retry it entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.072" offset="9363623">Based on the -- that doesn't of course precluded the possibility that some federal question could arise in the main case and that the principal case could be back here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.534" offset="9417540">Although, reading of the pleadings would not indicate that a federal question is involved.I do not intend to labor the question of jurisdiction of this Court, we're on to say that as far as Texas is concerned, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Texas on this venue question is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.177" offset="9508028">There has been no trial and no finality to the trial of -- to the case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.486" offset="9541360">If I may briefly give the Court just a little background to the case, this suit is the result of a very large and grand promotion of an insurance company known as the ICT, Insurance Company of Texas by a man by the name of Ben Jack Cage, who is now a fugitive from justice in Brazil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.448" offset="9645119">The liquidator who represents the creditors of that company and the stockholders of that company has filed a suit under the Texas practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.189" offset="9724113">Texas by statute has created a State Board of Insurance Commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.663" offset="9746056">And that Board in turn, pursuant to statute, has designated a liquidator for insolvent insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.139" offset="9779911">And in the proceeding in the state -- in the county of the state capital of Texas pursuant to statute, and the liquidator has been designated at the receiver for this insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.446" offset="9837171">Now, the Texas statute, as a part of our insurance code says that proceeding is by or against the liquidator, shall be brought in the county and the court where the delinquency proceedings are pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.813" offset="9918673">And that statute controls the venue and the jurisdiction of this Court unless the federal statute that is submitted by the appellants controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.773" offset="9978441">Let me say in the first place that we certainly agree that in the supremacy of Acts of Congress in the Constitution, we do not contest for one minute that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.488" offset="10037373">But let me first explain to the Court the choice that we had as attorneys for the liquidator in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.013" offset="10079378">The allegations are that the two Dallas banks in a sequence of yearend transactions in which the bank was represented by a vice president, would loan this man Cage, large sums of money up to a million dollars on his personal note.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.296" offset="10164537">And that the vice president of the bank would make out a deposit ticket to the ICT Insurance Company for that sum of money and the money would be put into the account of that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.676" offset="10218036">There would be a loan committee memorandum that the money was not to be withdrawn and was to be repaid on January the 2nd, three days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.533" offset="10269550">And that enabled the company to submit to the Board of Insurance Commissioners of Texas a yearend statement that will show it to be solvent and would gain it a license to do business for the succeeding years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.309" offset="10356590">The promoter, Ben Jack Cage, the various officers of the corporation, the directors of the corporation and various other people connected with this specific transaction to confine it to the one transaction, are people that we want and feel are necessary to be sued in a single lawsuit involving this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.858" offset="10458781">So, we have a choice now applying the suit in Dallas where the two banks are located or to file it in Austin, Texas, in Travis County, where the Texas statute says that the liquidator may institute the suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.060" offset="10551568">But every Texas -- may I say this, that every Texas case except this recent suit involving the title for Langdeau, including two cases in which the Supreme Court of Texas has denied a writ, has held that the Texas statute contained in this insurance code with reference to venue controls and the Supreme Court of Texas in this very case held that control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.624" offset="10657834">If we file this suit in Dallas, these other defendants under the Texas practice which I assume must be the practice generally, would have filed pleas of privilege to be sued in the county where they live and if there were corporations in the county where they're doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.054" offset="10731604">And since we didn't file it in Travis County where this Texas statute gives these jurisdictions, they would have had an absolute right to have move their part of the case to the county where they live.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.682" offset="10786147">The only practical opportunity that we have to sue all of these people that are important and necessary to this proceeding is under the Texas Insurance Code which says that we have the right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.416" offset="10853021">The liquidator has the right to sue in the county where the delinquency proceedings are pending in Travis County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.727" offset="10878307">And there, we can sue each and every one of the individuals at any company, any private corporation, and those people now are in court in Travis County and can't be moved to Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.330" offset="10928671">So if appellants position is sustained, the suit as to the banks alone will be taken out and move to Dallas whereas the other principles in these acts are left in Travis County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.445" offset="11009128">Let me go now to the statutes, to the decisions of this Court first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.561" offset="11037654">The first case that arose under this Act was Casey versus Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.761" offset="11058448">In Casey versus Adams, as you'll recall involved a suit for foreclosure of a mortgage or land in a parish in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.820" offset="11094601">A bank located in another parish was made a party defendant and the bank asserted its privilege under this statute to be sued in the county where it was located.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.154" offset="11147995">And this Court in Casey versus Adams held that the statute was not intended to apply to a local action, and it said not only local by common law history as this thing we contend to it, but local by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.207" offset="11216227">And we have cited two cases, one from Maine and one from Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.515" offset="11237439">Let's say that when a state statute fix this venue, that cause of action in a particular case, that cause of action in that case is a -- constitutes a local action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.857" offset="11294804">In this case, the Texas statute as sustained by the Supreme Court of Texas had fixed venues in Travis County and under the language of Casey versus Adams, it is a local action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.598" offset="11453733">And each one of them has sustained the venue in the county where the delinquency proceedings are pending.</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.344" offset="11492707">And as the Court well know, a land has always occupied a unique position in human history and under the jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.106" offset="11535757">We might have foreseen I suppose, that the Court when it -- we have a statute that says that a suit involving the title of land must be brought in the county where the land is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.538" offset="11577553">Then we have this statute that says the liquidator can file a suit in the county where the delinquency proceedings are pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.140" offset="11611930">Land went out as it has if you look back through the cited cases throughout history on this question, land always went out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.080" offset="11643695">All I can say about it is that in only the exception of land, the title of the land, as it been -- as the statute been sustained as controlled.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.437" offset="11785070">I do not say that the Court says -- may have stated in its opinion what I have stated but ever since I've been out in law school, a great deal has been made of the fact that courts have repeatedly treated land and particularly with reference to suits involving the title of the land is -- as a special and unique situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.085" offset="11875662">I'm presuming as a matter of history from the position of the fact that land was the only source of wealth for great many centuries and had a special relation during the futile days perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.770" offset="11930415">And you'll find that throughout the decided cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.217" offset="11944208">You can't get a -- but you can't get to escape the fact that in this very case, the same court held this statute controlled it, and that there are five or six other cases, all of the other cases that have arisen under the Texas statute have held the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.643" offset="12005961">That court, the Supreme Court in the Burke case is not reversing the position of those cases at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.366" offset="12028844">None of those cases involved the title of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.387" offset="12068968">The next case that I would like to point out to the Court is First National Bank versus Fellows ex rel Union Trust Company which reached this Court from Wisconsin in which a proceeding there had been instituted at the state capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.693" offset="12134170">And the bank was a party and was located in another county and raised this very question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.162" offset="12164054">And the Court decided that the venue and jurisdiction of the Court in this county of the state capital, controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.179" offset="12196133">Justice Van Devanter and it's to show that if the matter was before the Court, Justice Van Devanter in his dissent takes the position that this federal statute should have controlled it but it did not control it, and the decision of that -- of the Court at that time was just as in Casey versus Adams, it sustained the venue in a different county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.505" offset="12281396">The Morgan case cited by appellants was a case in which the Court held, and let me, in all frankness say, that the opinion is based on the assumption that the federal statute is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.148" offset="12351927">I don't deny that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.442" offset="12361122">But the decision is that the privilege that the bank has, and I would say if it had one, was waived when it wasn't raised in the lower court, it wasn't raised until it was on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.348" offset="12424756">Now, I'd like to further call the Court's attention to the fact that in that opinion, the Court expressly states that this proviso to the Act of July the 12th, 1892 which we rely as repealing this statute, the Court expressly stated that that suit had been filed before that Act was passed and that that Act was not considered in reaching the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.154" offset="12543979">Now, except by reference in two other cases, which didn't involve the point at all, there are no other decisions by this Court on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.102" offset="12591731">Of course, there are great many state court decisions as counsel for appellant has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.994" offset="12611375">And for one reason or another, they have generally and nearly unanimously found that this statute does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.087" offset="12643767">Now, I would like for a minute to trace the history of the statute as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.460" offset="12713253">The First National Bank, Bank of the United States, was created by act of Congress, granted a charter by act of Congress, it was no banking act, in 1791 and existed for 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.591" offset="12773752">And it had a provision in this charter granted by Congress that said that the bank could sue or be sued in any court of record or anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.713" offset="12842193">Following the -- the granting of charter and some years later while the bank was still in existence, the Supreme Court in the Deveaux case held that that did not confer -- that language did not confer jurisdiction on the federal circuit court which at that time was the trial court of the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.566" offset="12929651">That the federal courts had only expressed jurisdiction and that this language would not confer jurisdiction, although it would give authority for the corporation to be sued when the Court did have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.270" offset="12992449">That -- the charter of the first -- of the Bank of United States, the first one, expired after 20 years in following the financial problems of the war of 1812 was rechartered as the Second National Bank of the United States in 1860.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.351" offset="13052740">And the charter of the Second National Bank in addition to the language that I've quoted that it could sue and be sued, complain and defend in any court record, also, specifically said that the Circuit Court of the United States has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.929" offset="13131107">And it is my view that that was the outgrowth of the Deveaux case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.394" offset="13152946">And an effort to give jurisdiction to the federal court in the famous Osborn case the Supreme Court subsequently held that the bank having been chartered by act of Congress, any suit that it was involved then was a suit under the law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.273" offset="13224417">And according to the language, stated that the federal courts had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.205" offset="13256182">After that charter had expired as a result of -- during Henry Jackson's administration, there were no national banks at all from 1836 to 1863, the present National Banking Act which has come down to us with amendment before us was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.877" offset="13334862">And the first -- and if that National Banking Act is read side by side with these older charters, you will see that the author of that Act, wrote the Banking Act with his eye on many other provisions contained in those original charters including specific authority for the National Bank to be sued in the federal circuit and territorial courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.712" offset="13442173">A year later, the state courts were expressly included.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.870" offset="13462862">And the language of that Act though, instead of saying generally, said in the county and city or territory in which they are located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.823" offset="13506644">Now, it's my position that that language grew out of the old Deveaux case which had held that the federal courts had no jurisdiction until finally the second charter had been granted in which they were given expressed jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.847" offset="13582712">And that it was thought necessary both to mention both the federal courts and the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.305" offset="13604551">And that, that that is not a restriction but an affirmative grant and the language of that statute says ‘may'.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.092" offset="13635688">It doesn't say ‘may only be brought' or ‘must be brought', it says ‘may'.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.898" offset="13671006">And that historically as an affirmative grant and not a restriction, there was still a broader language which is still contained in the National Banking Act that national banks can sue and be sued, defend and complain in both -- in any court of record and in subject to that language has come down to us to this day and it's much broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.783" offset="13774555">But if I am wrong about that and let's assume for the moment that I am, and that this language was a restriction and incidentally, although -- and United States Code annotated, it says, venue statute, it says venue as a heading for this section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.191" offset="13848116">Neither the original Act nor any other official publications of the acts of Congress had used or ever used the word ‘venue'.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.529" offset="13885524">And I think it means jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.716" offset="13898271">But let's assume that it is a restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.670" offset="13934007">By 1882, the national banks were going -- were removing all cases to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.290" offset="13960547">I will agree with counsel and that a number of decisions have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.618" offset="13977893">There were filing suits in the federal courts and they were removing cases to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.630" offset="13997850">And Congress had an intent and a purpose to put national banks for the purpose of lawsuits on the same footing as state banks located in the same counties and territories where the national banks were located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.620" offset="14061902">And as far of renewing the charter, understanding the charters of the existing banks and also applicable to all future banks, it passed this Act of July the 12th, 1882, in which it said, the jurisdiction for suits hereafter brought by or against any association under any law providing for National Banking Associations, and then it accept suits between them and the United States or its officers and agents, shall be the same as and not other than the jurisdiction for suits by or against banks not organized under any law of the United States which do or might do banking business whereas such national banking associations maybe doing business when such suits maybe forgotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.052" offset="14315604">And then it says, “All laws and parts of laws of the United States inconsistent with this proviso be in the same or hereby repealed”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.468" offset="14361266">Now, that's not limited to suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.154" offset="14367953">It says nothing about suits in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.622" offset="14381850">It says suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.757" offset="14398360">And counsel, of course, following that, the leather -- this Leather Manufacturers' National Bank versus Cooper and several other cases arose in which involved an attempt to remove cases to federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.864" offset="14454784">And I do not deny that the language of this statute would apply in a removal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.683" offset="14478085">I simply say that Congress was trying to put national banks on the same footing as state banks, not only in removal cases but in all suits, it says suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.419" offset="14553004">And I might say for that I have traced every recodification of the federal statutes down to the present for fear that this present Act that is being urged by the appellants, might have been repassed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.549" offset="14629595">And except for the recodification in 1874 which was before this, all of the others have expressly said that they are not original enactments and they're not -- that they do not pass the language as contained therein as a new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.233" offset="14708276">And if there's any dispute as in 1926, if there's any dispute as what the statute means, you have to go back to the original enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3963.751" offset="15958392">I want to first address myself to Mr. Justice Goldberg's question concerning the Burke investment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.811" offset="15990575">All of these are Langdeau cases because he is the statutory receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.527" offset="16005517">This is a Langdeau case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.441" offset="16013145">But then 358 Southwestern 2d of page 354 at the very outset of the opinion, I quote from the reporter's series rather than the Texas reports because it's not yet in the Texas reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.119" offset="16067897">The Court says this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.578" offset="16073644">It is well settled that Exception 14 is mandatory where the privileges of property claim being important to the suit which call within its terms quoting -- citing some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.724" offset="16122232">They purport that the words used by the legislature in Section 4 (f) which we have involved here is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.397" offset="16148982">It does not provide that the actions makes in very end shall or must be brought in the county where the receivership is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.768" offset="16182418">A venue to hear or determine the proceeding is conferred upon the courts of that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.126" offset="16199868">But there is nothing to suggest that the lawmaker is intended for such courts to have exclusive venue of all suits by or against the receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.860" offset="16234768">Now, I skip a little bit over on page 555.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.009" offset="16247411">He says there is no conflict between the mandatory provisions of Exception 14, that's the land question and a permissive term to Section 4 (f), which is ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.158" offset="16292028">Since Section 16 does not require that the former yield to the letter in the case like the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.663" offset="16314075">Now finally, he comes to the conclusion in the -- as he must, having held that one is mandatory and the other is permissive, citing the general rule, a permissive statute applicable to actions of a particular kind must always yield to a mandatory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.340" offset="16380740">That's a self-evident fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.411" offset="16388995">And then he finally concludes that venue under Exception 14 is determined by the location of the land and the nature of the relief sought and it does not appear that the allegations of the petitioner fraudulently made and so forth so consequently the land venue statute control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.390" offset="16456913">Now, nowhere in that -- now that's two times that the Supreme Court of Texas has written upon the question of venue in concerning this -- the provision of 4 (f) that we have involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.609" offset="16513860">The other one is our case that the case that we have here wherein the court there said that it was unnecessary for the Court in our case, the Supreme Court of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.162" offset="16555969">It is unnecessary to our decision to determine whether this particular action is local or transitory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.386" offset="16580942">Well they answered it a year later in the Burke case in holding that it was a mandatory thing and consequent rules are transitory and it did not control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.076" offset="16615633">Now, he says this and I still quote from the Texas Court because it brings to bear the question that is really before this Court as a matter of practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="4145.560" offset="16685641">As he says in the Okeechobee case, if you got one bank or if you got 10 banks residing in different counties, each of them are necessary parties, if they weren't necessary parties, you would have to do your single individual cause of action whether under the construction sought by the banks in this case be impossible to enforce since you would be in 10 different counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.756" offset="16778428">Now, I confess to this Court the proposition that national banks are not industries anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.062" offset="16803610">I address the further proposition not that I dispute for a moment that the supremacy of the act of Congress that will control it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.113" offset="16831822">But the national banks should no longer the estimates of the Government that they were when the National Banking Act was adopted in the civil war days.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.888" offset="16866931">The national banks in effect are simply private corporations engaged in business for private benefit and as such are regulated by the comptroller of currency just as our state banks are regulated by our banking commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.682" offset="16918131">I say to Your Honor that there should not be any rule of law that says that the national -- the City Bank of New York although it advertises every time I read the magazine about having branches all over the world, can only be sued in New York City whereas the Chase Manhattan Bank across the street can be sued just as where you can catch it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.961" offset="16991169">Now, those two banks one of them being a state bank and one of them a national bank, I say to Your Honors that they're in direct competition that there is no particular reason for it and that there has been shown here that there has been in effect a repeal of the statute upon which the petitioners or the appellants in this case were liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.394" offset="17068910">Now, when Congress passed the Act in 1882 saying that the national banks should have a jurisdiction for a suit here and after it's brought by or against any association established under any law providing for national banking except suits between them and the United States or its officers and agents shall be the same as and not other than the jurisdiction for suits by or against banks not organized under this -- they so-called ‘where-to-do business'.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.883" offset="17190954">Now, what they contend for here is a dual standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.330" offset="17204642">They say that they want something more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.478" offset="17213315">Congress had said in plain and unmistakable language and there isn't any question to what that still was, that Congress said that they shall not be picked on, they shall not be -- suffer to any detriment, they shall not be subject to anything that is -- that you don't give to your own banks and chartered by your own state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.849" offset="17290742">Congress did not mean by that same token to make them particular wards of the federal government even though at that time they were issuing money that they were the instrumentalities of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.337" offset="17336717">They don't issue money anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="4309.627" offset="17341837">The Federal Reserve System has taken over the national banking functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.545" offset="17357511">They are the instrument of finance of the country, not national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.440" offset="17373184">I say to Your Honors that there is here in this case a complete order and absolute answer to it, that is to say, that this statute upon which the banks rely here has been effectively repealed, that it has been repealed by an act of Congress and that the congressional treatment of banks, the reason for its existence is no longer fair and that's the reason that it was repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.296" offset="17476524">Now, in this case, it seems that this is a rather unimportant point, but the banks are involved in this case for the 142 other people.</text>

            <text syncTime="4368.111" offset="17575790">The facts seek to remove every facet of this matter to Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.187" offset="17592090">That leaves a 140 of them back in Austin to try the rest of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.831" offset="17610689">Now the banks don't come before this Court under the record here as anything other than relying upon the cold, bare rule that they're in business as national banks and they're entitled to be sued only in the County of Dallas, that that's the only place that you can get them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.612" offset="17685817">Now the lawsuit is in Austin as to 140 people.</text>

            <text syncTime="4413.726" offset="17758229">His case is reported and it's cited in our briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="4438.601" offset="17857808">There -- whereupon the bank loaned him $400,000 on the last date of December of 1952 on a note due January 2, 1954, my first year was wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="4451.685" offset="17910157">It was due and payable January 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.342" offset="17920711">They said that the box and treasury bills are $400,000, for those -- and of course, they kept the treasury bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.831" offset="17950699">In January 2, they sold the treasury bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.394" offset="17960939">They paid off the note and they gave them back the unopened box containing allegedly $584,000 worth of premium notes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4480.448" offset="18025200">We have $400,000 worth of treasury bills but there's nobody who had any money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.435" offset="18045158">We have $184,000 worth of premium notes and they were in that box in the bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="4548.035" offset="18295515">And in appearing here today, we appear here not in the nature of -- as you would normally do, to litigate, but for a receiver seeking to collect money from perpetrators of fraudulent transactions so that we could pay off judgment that were recovered by the widows and the orphans in Texas and to pay them the money that we believe rightfully belongs to them, but to say that because there's an old statute of dubious ancestry and history, it's going to say we must segregate this lawsuit and try it in two places, is in effect to deny the receiver the right to bring a lawsuit, any lawsuit, anywhere or anytime.</text>

            <text syncTime="5089.150" offset="20460022">Mr. Justice Goldberg in Texas, the subject of venue is taken very seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.029" offset="20483532">There is a statute, revised civil statute Article 1995, which has 30 odd subdivisions of exceptions to the venue right to be sued in one's home county, the annotations to it practically filled the volume that is the venue statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.997" offset="20567333">On other hand, practice on a plea of privilege is governed by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.734" offset="20594291">And under the Texas Rules as interpreted by our Texas Court, there is full provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.665" offset="20621981">And in this, I respectfully disagree with the counsel for transfer of actions as to which a plea of privilege is sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.194" offset="20664195">Moreover, under Article 1995, there is an exception to the right to be sued in one's home county, which says that where there are codefendants, they may be sued in any county where one of them can be called.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.655" offset="20742040">And under that provision, coupled with the transferability provision, my understanding of Texas venue laws sir is that this whole action may in the discretion of the Civil District Court in Travis County of where this case originated, be transferred to Dallas.</text>

            <text syncTime="5392.428" offset="21673044">We would greatly prefer to do so and thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.080" offset="21687672">Secondly, Mr. Justice Brennan, I would reply that the trial of these banks apart from the other defendants is a hazard and not an insurmountable one of litigation which would be encountered anytime that the federal venue statute applicable to them was applied and the balance of the action brought in Travis County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.244" offset="21784325">Turning to the second question that I would like to mention in reply concerning the opinion of the Texas Supreme Court in the Langdeau against Burke Investment Company case, I would like to point out that the context in which this question of the Texas Supreme Court's ruling has arisen in this case, is a contention by the appellee made until we arrived here today, that Article 21.28 of the Texas Insurance Code, subdivision 4 (f), required this suit to be brought in the Court where the delinquency proceedings were pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.612" offset="21973870">And from that platform, appellee sprung forward to the contention that Texas law had localized the situs of an action by a receiver as though it were not a plenary suit brought with the separate number and possibly in a separate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.219" offset="22056208">Of course, we pointed out that such a contention lived down an avenue which would prohibit suits by the receiver in any federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.865" offset="22094869">A suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act, there are many difficulties rationally with that contention made but I mentioned it only in order that the Court may appreciate the context in which this question has been briefed and in which it has come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.883" offset="22158921">Now, we point it out because of this contention in the reply brief on the merits filed by Mercantile Bank in Number 14 which was then number 90 last term, at page 11 that the decision of the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Holt against Wheeler in which the Texas Supreme Court had dismissed a writ of error stated Section 4 (f) is remedial or procedural because it deals exclusively with the venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.288" offset="22300505">It is not a statute dealing with substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5554.230" offset="22320253">Now, we thought that decision made perfectly clear that the contention of appellee that this action had been “localized” within the purview of Casey against Adams was untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5570.924" offset="22387022">When the Supreme Court stated in Langdeau against Burke that the statute merely signifies an intention to give plaintiff the right if he chooses to maintain the suit there, the contention disappears all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="5588.130" offset="22455881">Now, lastly in response to this question of local actions, I would like to point out that this question is a question of federal and not of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5603.365" offset="22516799">While we have been debating here, this question of what Holt against Wheeler and Burke against Langdeau and other Texas decisions hold, in our view, this is purely a question of federal law under Baltimore and Ohio Railroad against Kepner and similar decisions holding that the interpretation of a federal venue right is purely a question of federal law for this Court to determine and not some state label.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.522" offset="22637484">Under federal decisions cited in our brief, in the reply brief of Mercantile Bank, number 90, last term, number 14 this term, those cases are set forth and clearly show that this is purely a transitory action being a plenary civil action for money damages direct offense and alleged tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.903" offset="22734973">Now, I'd like to, if Your Honors please, to turn briefly to this contention that there was a repeal of this venue statute in 1882 by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.381" offset="22804877">As a preliminary, I would like to say that between 1864 and 1875, this venue statute was known as Section 57 of the National Bank Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.424" offset="22865063">From 1875 on, it's been known as Section 5198 of the revised statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.780" offset="22894529">And I say that because I'm going to make reference to some cases that discussed it one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.680" offset="22918144">In 1873, the Congress passed an amendment to Section 57, which provided that there should be no attachment in a state court against a national bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.811" offset="22998601">That aspect of Section 57 passed in 1873 has no application here except that it casts light on the decision of a later case in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5736.405" offset="23048965">In 1882 because of the 1875 legislation conferring general federal question jurisdiction on the federal courts and bringing into play the Osborn decision for national banks and permitting them always to go into federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.531" offset="23141543">Congress passed this legislation saying that the jurisdiction of suits against national bank -- by and against national banks shall be none other than banks which are not chartered under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.684" offset="23202147">A counsel has constructed an argument based on the fact that it doesn't say federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5783.037" offset="23235480">The fact is that this Court has passed in half a dozen decisions on the meaning of that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5790.171" offset="23264005">The cases are cited in our brief, Petri case coming down finally to the Buford case in 1903.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.849" offset="23322728">And in the Buford case -- excuse me Your Honor -- this Court said that that 1882 legislation which counsel contends repealed the state court venue provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.503" offset="23413426">The necessary effect of this legislation was to make national banks for purposes of suing and being sued in the Circuit Courts of the United States, citizens of the state in which they are respectively located and to withdraw from them the right to invoke the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts of the United States simply on the ground that they were created by and exercised their powers under acts of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5856.472" offset="23529305">No other purpose can be imputed to Congress than to effect that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="5863.657" offset="23558040">Now, with all of the possibly appealing arguments made by counsel for the treatment of a bank, one bank across the street from another bank, respectfully Your Honors, should be addressed to the legislature and not to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.104" offset="23643826">With those reasons being attributed to Congress by appellee, the whole argument falls when this Court says to the -- flatly to the contrary that no purpose such as counsel is suggesting to Your Honors can be attributed to the Congress in enacting that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5908.547" offset="23737553">Now, I mentioned a moment ago an amendment to Section 57 of the National Bank Act prohibiting attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.538" offset="23777573">Now attachment is a way of getting personal jurisdiction, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="5923.672" offset="23798053">And in the Van Reed case to which Mr. Johnson made reference and which is cited in Mercantile Bank's opening brief, this Court was faced with a contention that this 1882 legislation, just as counsel has just now argued to you, was intended to put all banks on the same footing, and that if you could get an attachment against the state bank than this 1882 law repealed Section 57 pro tanto to put on them on an equal footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5959.421" offset="23941099">And this Court flatly rejected that contention and (Inaudible) flatly rejected the contention made by counsel today that this Act relating to state court venue was somehow repealed by 1882 legislation having the purpose of dealing with federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5982.972" offset="24035244">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
