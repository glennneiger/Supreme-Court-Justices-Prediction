            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell</label>
            <text syncTime="20.473" offset="185240">Mr. Chief Justice Warren and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.817" offset="214601">I am appearing here in my own behalf, being the petitioner in the case, and the matter comes here on certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed in part a conviction for criminal contempt against me under one of some seven specifications that was entered against my co-counsel and myself in a case that was tried before Judge Julius H. Miner in United States District Court in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.375" offset="416893">Two citations of contempt which were entered by Judge Miner against me were reversed as a matter of law by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.805" offset="466631">You know, as all -- as I have already stated, four citations against Mr. Lee Freeman, who was my co-counsel, were also reversed totally because insufficient as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.100" offset="527757">The part of the specification that was affirmed as against me is described by the Court of Appeals as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.644" offset="561925">I won't attempt to characterize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.363" offset="568822">I'll read what they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.649" offset="589928">As to Specification 6, we hold that with the exception of one statement attributed to respondent, nothing with which he is charged has been supported by proof of contemptuousness or disrespect.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.315" offset="652622">The exception in Specification 6 to which we have just referred charges that respondent said, “We don't have a right to read the answers but we have a right to ask the questions and we propose to do so unless some bailiff stops us.”</text>
            <text syncTime="156.808" offset="730572">The majority opinion held that this constituted contempt and Judge Duffy who, former chief judge of the Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit, said that, in his opinion, it did not and that there was no obstruction to the administration of justice required by the statute, and that he would reverse as to that specification, as well as the other two, which the Court of Appeals had reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.811" offset="834644">Now, to understand the context and the background in which these remarks were made, and to understand the issue which is presented for review here in this Court, it is necessary for me to advert briefly to the case that was being tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.870" offset="914892">I represented the plaintiff, the Parmelee Transportation Company in an antitrust suit which was brought against six railroads, four railroad presidents, and a man by the name of Hugh W. Cross who is former Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.378" offset="988871">And, it was alleged, and we sought to prove, that Mr. Cross, as Chairman, had importuned the presidents of these railroads to transfer the transfer of business that is carrying passengers between terminals in Chicago from the Parmelee Company which had enjoyed the business for some 102 years to a company to be formed by a Mr. Keeshin, and we alleged conspiracy in damages and our complaint was tested by a judge who is now dead, calling that it constituted, as a matter of law, a good complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.106" offset="1151770">We spent three years taking depositions and spent thousands and thousands of dollars, and we got down to the trial of the case and Judge Miner called us all in and he said he had decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.834" offset="1198686">No motion was made to this at all, that he was going to try an issue which he designated as the issue of public injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.739" offset="1246333">We'd ask for a jury trial on all issues in the case and Judge Miner said, “We're not going to try anything before this jury except the issue of whether the public has been injured in money damages by the shift of this transfer contract from the Parmelee Company to the Keeshin Company.”</text>
            <text syncTime="305.241" offset="1324387">I took the position before Judge Miner, citing this Court's decisions in the Klor's and Radovich case, that that was not an issue in an antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.702" offset="1362213">It was only an attempt to hedge us in and keep us from trying our lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.955" offset="1387186">And, my objections were overruled and that court said we will proceed to trial on the sole issue of public injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.703" offset="1430235">At that point, I offered to stipulate with opposing counsel as to offers of proof which I would make on the issue of conspiracy and monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.207" offset="1472240">I saw right away that we we're not going to try anything of an antitrust nature in the case, but I want to get it out of the court up to the Court of Appeals as quickly and expeditiously as I could, and I offered in open court to make that stipulation and opposing counsel said, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.638" offset="1553951">We will not stipulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.554" offset="1561579">The issue must be tried and must be tried before the jury as specified by Judge Miner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="372.142" offset="1591986">Although, they themselves took that the position that that was not a proper issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.397" offset="1620929">In that situation, we attempted to make offers of proof and there's a rule -- better Rule of Civil Procedure 43 (c), a rule promulgated by this Court under the directions and the authority of the Congress, which provides how offers of proof can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.665" offset="1705984">And, it provides that, in order to make an offer of proof -- a proper offer of proof in a case before a jury, you must put a witness on the stand or at least if you're reading a deposition, you must read the question that was asked to the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.096" offset="1759796">And then, when the court rules, whether or not it's a proper question, then you can read the answer if it's a deposition or you can outside the presence of the jury, you can make your offer of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.859" offset="1810787">Now, there was never any question in the case that that's the proper way to proceed, at least otherwise, there was never any such question.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.649" offset="1853942">Judge Miner -- first, we attempted to proceed in a different way to shorten the thing up and counsel said “we are not going to stood -- sit here or sit by and permit for one moment any offers of proof which are not made in exact accordance with Rule 40 (c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure,” and we went along making Rule -- making --</text>

            <text syncTime="476.517" offset="2009422">Page 598 of the transcript of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.101" offset="2023737">Mr. Thompson, he's our chief counsel, "We are not going to wait until he finishes the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.810" offset="2054562">We are not going to sit still for one moment and have an offer of proof made that is directed to a question be -- pending before a witness who is not on the stand, who is on the stand because that's exactly what the rule says, and we will undertake to try this according to the rule,” and he was referring to Rule 43 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="507.637" offset="2133870">Alright, we went along for a while asking the questions, and the court from time to time made the observation that he was not going to hear or permit the jury to hear anything concerning Mr. Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.337" offset="2192697">Mr. Cross was the defendant in the case and we've taken depositions of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.016" offset="2219447">And then, we got down to taking a depos -- reading the deposition of Mr. Howard Simpson, who is President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Mr. Freeman, my co-counsel, was attempting to ask -- read the questions which had been asked of Mr. Simpson on his deposition, and the court stopped him.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.671" offset="2318085">And, the court said, "We are not going to have anymore reading of these questions" and that was on the face of the objection of counsel that that was the only way it could be done, and Mr. Freeman said "I am in the uncomfortable position," and I'm paraphrasing the words, "of having counsel telling me to have to do it according to form as prescribed by the rule and Your Honor telling me that I can't proceed that way."</text>
            <text syncTime="582.274" offset="2432502">And, at that stage of the proceeding, I was sitting there in the courtroom, not conducting this reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.469" offset="2469282">I entered the discussion and I told the judge that we had to ask the questions because that was the only way we could make our proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.251" offset="2516407">And, there was further colloquy and the judge finally indicated that he was not letting us proceed and I made the statements which I did in the heat of the situation in which we were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.066" offset="2583594">And then, we had a recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.437" offset="2601148">And then, after the recess, we came back and decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.955" offset="2615150">We've done everything that a lawyer can do to make his record and we said that we would hear to the court's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.213" offset="2656214">Now, there are two, or possibly three, fundamental and controlling considerations which are raised by this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.218" offset="2708250">In the first place, we did not pursue those offers of proof so far as Mr. Cross' participation in that conspiracy was concerned, at least not with that witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.949" offset="2763212">And, the deposition showed that there have been talks where Mr. Cross had importuned him to use his influence to bring these railroads together to exclude us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.126" offset="2811904">Well, we had the trial on the error of an issue, which signified nothing because there was no issue permitted to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.476" offset="2845236">We weren't permitted to introduce any offer of conspiracy or any evidence of conspiracy or monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.120" offset="2871881">The jury found that there was no money damages under the instructions which were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.609" offset="2885778">It was practically a directed verdict, and then we came to the end of the trial and the court said, "I'm going to write an opinion and I'm going to hold that there isn't -- this doesn't fall within the family of antitrust that the complaint doesn't state a cause of action."</text>
            <text syncTime="710.446" offset="2945128">And then he went on and said this, "The offers of proof upon which the plaintiff -- the proofs upon which the plaintiffs apparently were going to rely, the allegations of Cross' intervention in this situation are not supported by the offers of proof.”</text>
            <text syncTime="732.418" offset="3033004">And, the reason I most respectfully submit to this Court that they weren't supported by the offers of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.478" offset="3053275">If they weren't, I don't think that's a correct statement, I think they were, but assuming arguendo that they were not, we couldn't make them and we couldn't make them in compliance with the rule because we were precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.429" offset="3117119">Further, when we got up in the Court of Appeals on the appeal in the Parmelee case, the Court of Appeals passed by the fact, Judge Duffy mentioned it in his dissent, the fact that we'd had no trial on any issue that was relevant to an antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.465" offset="3205204">And, as a make way, the court below had dismissed the complaint after another judge had held it was valid and then made his remarks about the offers of proof, but the upper court said that its analysis of the offers of proof led it to believe that this didn't constitute a valid antitrust case, even though this case had held -- this Court had held in the in the other cases, a conspiracy affecting this very branch of commerce violated the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.798" offset="3322546">So, the case was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.165" offset="3336025">Now, the point I'm making and leading up to is counsel who has exceeded and who has met the requirements of a judge to stop, his client is utterly prejudiced in appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.486" offset="3425364">His record is not complete and will be faced with a situation which was referred to by Mr. -- the late Mr. Justice Rutledge in the Mineworkers case where he said, "If you reach a situation where obedience means the loss of the rights -- the substantive rights, compliance means the loss of a substantive right, you're in a situation where no court should declare that criminal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="862.065" offset="3551587">Now, we are relying here, I am relying here, upon the limitations, upon the inherent power of a court to punish for contempt which are contained in U.S. Code Section 401, Sections 1 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.973" offset="3643225">This Court has held that, in a number of cases, that that is the congressional limitation upon the power of the Federal District Courts to punish for contempt, and they've also held -- this Court has also held that there must be shown two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.466" offset="3713233">No, I regard that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.665" offset="3725981">This Court has held in the Hudgings case that there must be shown an obstruction to justice as a condition preceding to a proper exercise of the power of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.351" offset="3784808">Section 3 of that statute provides that it must be shown that there is disobedience to a lawful order to constitute contempt punishable by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.259" offset="3860459">Now, my first position is that Judge Miner's order or direction abrogated Rule 43 (c), promulgated by this Court under the directions of the Congress, was not a lawful order and, while I didn't disobey it, still it posed a situation where I was entitled to go as far as I could go to show an unequivocal refusal by the court to let me proceed in accordance with the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.161" offset="4020015">As I say, after the recess, we told the Court we would ask no further questions regarding the incident or regarding the depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.103" offset="4067767">Now, is it a lawful order that abrogates a rule of court promulgated by the Congress -- promulgated by this Court under the authority of the Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.652" offset="4118026">And, I find no case and the Government cites no case which holds that that is a lawful order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.792" offset="4150523">Certainly, it's a case of first impression here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.071" offset="4163688">This Court has never held that the abrogation of a rule which is reenact of Congress and which the lower courts, the courts of appeal has said is binding upon the court, is binding upon the litigant, is binding upon the lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.748" offset="4230353">The abrogation of such a rule is a lawful order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.520" offset="4245504">Now, Judge Miner, himself, later in this case -- can you get the conjunction statement he made?</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.029" offset="4295450">He said, and I'm reading from page 935 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1080.740" offset="4426376">That, in the absence of a stipulation, the cases, as I read them, require the presenting of a witness, ask him some questions and, when I declined to let him answer, then they can proceed with the offer of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.274" offset="4472456">By Mr. Thompson, “There isn't any question about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1323.336" offset="5396668">The majority opinion says here that I had a right, and I'm not saying this in any argumentative way, I'm just saying what the court says, that I had a right to be in that court and ask questions and make offers of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.152" offset="5495933">And they didn't say it, but the inference was clear that it was part of the machinery of trying lawsuits for the machinery of justice, and that I had a right to make an offer of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.523" offset="5541491">They say that without any equivocation whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.644" offset="5561971">Now, if I had a right to make an offer of proof, I most respectfully submit to this Court that I had a right to make it in a way that made sense on appeal, and I had a right to make it in a way which corresponded with the rules of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.833" offset="5622680">And, in correspondence, in a sense, where the statute is laid down by the Congress because the Congress told this Court, through a commission, to write these rules, which was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.571" offset="5661654">Now, if I had a right to appear there, if I had a right to make an offer of proof, the question I submit to this Court is why didn't I have a right to make it in accordance with the rules of this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.027" offset="5739499">Now, it can be made to appear here that my action was antagonistic to the court as such, it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.926" offset="5779101">I was trying, in the only way that I knew, in the heat of a highly contested trial involving millions of dollars to make a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.113" offset="5811806">I knew I wasn't going anywhere in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.045" offset="5827584">My only chance was to make a record in the appeal and I was being thwarted, as Judge Duffy says at every turn, and every time I try to make an offer of proof and the judge would change his opinion and change his ruling, and that was the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.508" offset="5901354">Now, further than that, of course the question, whether I was trying to deal with it in good faith, trying to represent a client and nothing more, that goes to the question of whether or not that's what I was trying to do, and that's one of the six questions that, I submit, shouldn't have been determined by Judge Miner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.788" offset="5974497">It should have been determined by somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.086" offset="5983692">If he wasn't intimately involved, we had seven specifications of contempt here, six of them knocked out as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.307" offset="6012635">And, further, the whole basis of that thing, as this Court said in the Radiant Burners case, was an absolutely irrelevant issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.805" offset="6054640">Now, the next question was whether or not there was any obstruction to the administration of justice and the Government seems to say -- well, the Government seems to say two things in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.652" offset="6101974">First, that any opposition to a court's order is per se contemptuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.812" offset="6130604">Well, I realize that courts had to be wrong and I realize that the judges have to run them, but I most humbly submit that the public and litigants have very fundamental rights in having counsel who are independent enough and have enough latitude to properly present their cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.742" offset="6222346">Certainly, they ought to have enough latitude so that they can present a case in accordance with rules promulgated by this very Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.275" offset="6260485">And, if that's contemptuous, I guess it's contemptuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.892" offset="6270934">I don't know anything else to say about it, except that I was trying the best I could in a very difficult situation to assert some rights and I didn't succeed very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.939" offset="6327150">Judge Duffy saw the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.458" offset="6333210">He saw there was no obstruction to justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.417" offset="6341047">The Government here says that anything that shows a conflict between a counsel and a court would tend to bring disrespect to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.294" offset="6372498">On the contrary, I think the lay public has more respect for a judicial process which gives latitude to a trial counsel to properly represent a client's right than it does to us observing, lawyer-counsel, or a bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.851" offset="6446791">And, that's what's really involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.263" offset="6456404">The question of my client of a hundred dollars means this trivia with the question of latitude to trial counsel in important litigations such as this where he's not permitted to try anything, something that I think, serve --</text>

            <text syncTime="1760.394" offset="7144991">That's what I was trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.180" offset="7160142">Alright, so we get down to the question of obstruction of justice and Justice Duffy -- or Judge Duffy said that he could see no obstruction to justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.303" offset="7200580">And, under this statute, Judge -- under this statute, it's a limitation if it's anything and we're left in this situation doing that, if any order -- if any order that a judge enters from the trial of a case or otherwise is lawful per se, and it's just lawful, why, of course this limitation in the statute that must be lawful has no meaning whatever because there's no objective standard at all to measure the judge's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.424" offset="7345089">It's just lawful if he enters it, and that's that and that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.384" offset="7360867">Now, the second limitation was that no obstruction of justice and the majority court found, in dealing with this Specification 6, that the court made no finding of obstruction to justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.782" offset="7414471">Judge Miner did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.058" offset="7419591">And, they said “we don't base our decision on that,” but we conclude from that that if there was no such finding, then the record doesn't support any such finding, and they made that observation with reference to this Specification 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.668" offset="7474030">Now, there's one further point and then I'm through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.058" offset="7499630">In this situation, Judge Miner stated that he regards this as a direct attack upon himself and he also stated that there was no emergency about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.924" offset="7547068">I had business in London and I had to go to Europe to attend to it, and I told him that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.224" offset="7568280">He said there's no emergency about it, put it over, and we put it over until June or sometime ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.876" offset="7590849">Then, he went over into a fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.749" offset="7602343">There was no emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.696" offset="7606105">There was nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.170" offset="7608090">The case went on, the trial went on, the record was made, but Judge Miner apparently indicated that he thought this was my direct attack upon himself, which it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.379" offset="7664933">And, if there was an issue of fact involved in that, I submit most humbly to this Court that the bar should have some of the rights of the Bill of Rights, that is, they're dealt with summarily here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.290" offset="7728567">And, whether or not they're acting in good faith as lawyers, as members of the bar, whether or not they're trying to protect client's rights in the only way they know how to do, whether or not they might make some error inadvertently or because they don't know anything else to do, as it might be the call of the situation here, that is a question which goes to intent and, it seems to me, I was entitled to have some independent judge who wasn't involved in the controversy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.263" offset="7836400">That was refused and the judge who heard it on seven specifications, only part of one was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.039" offset="7867538">Now, that itself is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.796" offset="7878510">I submit that this should be reversed, not for my benefit particularly but for the bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="1961.953" offset="7951235">As it's true in so many cases, the issue here turns very largely on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.907" offset="7991045">I would like -- I would like now to point out that contrary to the position that has been taken by my opponent, there was no interference with the right of the plaintiff in the civil antitrust suit to make any offer of proof he chose to, and I think that the best witness of that is Mr. McConnell himself, as I shall now point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.584" offset="8181739">In volume 3, page 1035 of the record, in about the middle of the page, Mr. McConnell is speaking and he says “I am trying to make a record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.596" offset="8253733">We can't help it, but sometimes there comes, in the lives of lawyers and judges, conflicts where there are issues raised where one side is trying to make a record, and that is what we are trying to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.630" offset="8309844">That is what we are trying to do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.063" offset="8319666">By the court, “May I ask one question?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.636" offset="8337951">By Mr. McConnell, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.973" offset="8351222">By the court, “Have I stopped you from making your record?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.551" offset="8369612">By Mr. McConnell, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.885" offset="8382882">By the court, “Haven't I sustained you all the way to make the record?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.202" offset="8400227">By Mr. McConnell, “You are letting us make the record.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.201" offset="8416214">By the court, “Absolutely.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.592" offset="8429693">And then, in the proceedings on the contempt itself, on volume 5 of the record, this is the thin volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.905" offset="8466996">On page 36, the court said in the middle of the page, “From the words that you have used and the statements that are shown in the record, there isn't any question but you -- but that you have exceeded every reasonable limitation in the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.761" offset="8550379">But, I still certainly have no malice in my heart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.196" offset="8560201">I never did in my life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.613" offset="8565844">I've been on the bench 23 years and I've never done this before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.315" offset="8580681">There is one thing one must do, protect the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.983" offset="8595310">Over the objections of the defense counsel, I think that all the way down the line, I have let you make your record completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.778" offset="8626448">There's not a scintilla of evidence, not a statement that will indicate that you have been curtailed in any way in making your offer of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.105" offset="8659780">Isn't that right?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.053" offset="8667617">Mr. Thomas McConnell, “Well, we have made our offers of proof.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.859" offset="8682768">The court, “Completely.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.766" offset="8698441">Now, with that as a purpose, I would like to review or re-review very briefly the circumstances that led up to the allegedly contemptuous statement in order to show that there can be no doubt that Judge Miner had made a categorical and definitive ruling preventing the counsel for the plaintiff in the civil suit from proceeding in the manner in which they had been proceeding, namely by reading from the deposition of Mr. Simpson, questions bearing upon the so-called conspiracy involving -- with Mr. Cross at the center.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.456" offset="8993207">Now, in the pages immediately pre -- in volume 2 of the record at page 731, in the pages immediately preceding this, this process had been going on for page after page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.253" offset="9068335">Mr. Freeman would read a question in the deposition of Mr. Simpson bearing upon this issue which Judge Miner had ruled, whether rightly or wrongly is certainly immaterial for this case, was not an issue before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.784" offset="9154539">And, the court said it is becoming obvious that the repetition of question after question about the matter on which the court has ruled is not competent and proper as distinguished from an offer of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.356" offset="9204799">It ought not to be hammered and repeated before the jury time and time again, and I would appreciate it very much if you would make your offer -- if you would make your offer of proof in all the conversations, if any, and Mr. Freeman, interrupting, said “excuse me, I have only this problem, as Mr. McConnell has well stated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.660" offset="9285987">The statute controlling in this regard is Section -- Rule 43 (b).”</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.892" offset="9302915">I might interpolate it at this point to say that the reference there should have been Rule 43 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.752" offset="9334366">That is where I got this from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.596" offset="9341785">By Mr. Freeman, “It requires that we do present a witness and we do go thru this deposition, although we do it in person, and we ask the question which may be objected to and it is sustained, and then we offer to prove what the witness would say pursuant to that question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.040" offset="9403538">Then, skipping the next couple of paragraphs just for brevity, Mr. Freeman resumes “we find ourselves in an uncomfortable position of both being accused of bad form,” he means being accused by defense counsel, “in making the offer of proof and being accused of bad form when we ask the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.930" offset="9483055">I think we have to try to protect our record by asking the question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.849" offset="9498728">Now, I might explain at this point that that statement is correct, but the defense counsel had been objecting -- the defense counsel did not want an offer of proof to be made even generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.624" offset="9561840">That as a part from there being a witness on the stand, and they did not want the questions to be asked of the witness on the stand or questions and answers read in the case of a deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.611" offset="9625788">So, that is perfectly correct what Mr. Freeman said there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.465" offset="9641253">But, now, here is the crucial part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.044" offset="9647522">By the court, “I will not object and I will permit your form of offer of proof in the absence of the jury by overruling their objections to the form.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.517" offset="9701439">The court is now saying he's going to overrule defense counsel's objections to the form of the offer of proof that Mr. McConnell and Mr. Freeman had originally wanted, in other words, the general offer of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.612" offset="9757863">The court, continuing, said “you have had the witness on the stand or you have had these depositions or you have these depositions, and you have identified the witness and you have asked questions about conversations and about issues not before this jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.952" offset="9807182">The same ruling prevails on all of the same questions and if you ask him a million times, it will be the same ruling and it becomes obvious to the jury and to the court that you are merely repeating something that the court had ruled on.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.962" offset="9863189">By Mr. McConnell “Their objection is right,” referring to the defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.952" offset="9883146">“They have made a sound objection to proceeding without the witness or without the deposition, and we have to make a record and your rulings are going to be reviewed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.531" offset="9921494">By the court, “Alright, but the witness has been on the stand and depositions are being read.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.555" offset="9945631">By Mr. McConnell, “Now, you are trying to tell us we can't ask these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.798" offset="9966529">We have a right to ask these questions and, until we are stopped from asking these questions, we are going to ask them because it is our prerogative in doing it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.874" offset="10010833">By the court, “I am now stopping you from asking the questions about conversations with Mr.Cross because I have ruled specifically, definitely, and completely that it is not an issue in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.734" offset="10066317">By Mr. McConnell, “We have a right to ask them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.988" offset="10079274">By the court, “You can offer proof on it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.295" offset="10096515">By Mr. McConnell, “We have a right to ask questions which we offer on this issue and Your Honor can sustain their objections to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.961" offset="10123264">We don't have a right to read the answers, but we a right to ask questions and we propose to do so unless some bailiff stops us.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.624" offset="10149909">That was the allegedly contemptuous statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.187" offset="10164120">I'd like to go on just a little bit more because of what follows is pertinent to the position taken by Judge Duffy in his defense below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.262" offset="10200377">The court said “Well, I will stop you now and I don't appreciate threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.619" offset="10217827">That is the law and my judgment and I can rule upon -- and I can only rule upon as I see it, and I forbid you from asking, repeating the same questions over and over again, upon which I have ruled specifically 100 times that it's not admissible and is improper under this issue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.285" offset="10276551">And then, there was a pre-colloquy between Mr. Freeman and the court in which Mr. Freeman elicited from the court the assurance that this ruling applied only as of this particular deponent, Mr. Simpson, under these particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.061" offset="10351574">For example, at the bottom of page733, the court says “This does not bar you from making an offer of proof in the absence of the jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.663" offset="10386056">By Mr. Freeman, “I assume you are merely barring me from asking questions that have to do with Cross and Simpson.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.891" offset="10410924">By the court, “The same repetitious questions, over and over again, I am not barring you from making the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.615" offset="10433808">You will make all the offer you want, but not in the presence of the jury because the issue before them is limited.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.535" offset="10477484">And then, in the middle of the page, the court says -- Mr. Freeman says “We think conspiracy and the fact that the public service of Cross was destroyed by this is part of the public injury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.285" offset="10520534">By the court, “That is what you think and make your offer a proof, but not in the presence of the jury -- of this jury,” and then Mr. Freeman asked for a 10-minute recess, which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.843" offset="10562748">And, after the jury had departed but before the attorneys and the court broke up, the court said to Mr. McConnell, “Mr. McConnell, we are not plain to the galleries here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.888" offset="10606947">I am ruling upon rules of evidence and I see them,” and these are not evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.374" offset="10632861">By Mr. McConnell, “I am not plain to any galleries.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.318" offset="10644668">By the court, “I am not going to have any more of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.835" offset="10654699">By Mr. McConnell, “I am trying to try a law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.756" offset="10666402">I am being prevented from trying it at every stage of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.776" offset="10678523">By the court, “It doesn't call for insults or abuse.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.251" offset="10692420">By Mr. McConnell, “I am not making any insults.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.352" offset="11516740">And, why was there no obstruction of justice?</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.831" offset="11526666">Because the petitioner did not make good his threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.711" offset="11554252">He did -- he did not wait for a bailiff to come and remove him from the court, but finally exceeded to the ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.918" offset="11587062">Now, I submit to the Court that the obstruction of the administration of justice is not limited solely to some spectacular happening in the court, such as happened in Ex parte Terry where one of the attorneys physically assaulted a court official and had to be escorted from the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.884" offset="11674937">There can be obstruction of the administration of justice in an insolent remark to a court, an expression of defiance, or any form -- really, any form of disrespect and, so far as I know, that proposition has never been questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.818" offset="11758634">And, in any event, even if it were necessary to find some physical or overt obstruction here, certainly, it can be found in fact that Judge Miner had to take time from the trial of the case to administer the review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.692" offset="11838151">Now, on the question of whether or not the summary procedure was proper, as distinguish from proceeding by notice and hearing under Rule 42 (b), it is the Government's position quite simply that this case is controlled by the Sacher case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.169" offset="11924041">Now, the petitioner reads the Offutt case, which was decided after the Sacher, as somehow impairing the questioning eluding the authority of the Sacher case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.284" offset="11980466">We do not so-read the Offutt decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.766" offset="11990392">We read the Offutt decision as laying down a special qualification, namely, that where a trial judge has become so personally and emotionally embroiled in the conduct of the accused that he is unable to bring to the task of vindicating the authority of the court, a sufficient degree of judicial detachment to enable him to perform that function in a judicial manner that he should ask the Chief Judge of the court to assign the hearing of the alleged contempt to another judge, but that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.258" offset="12184430">Judge Miner throughout the two weeks of this very vigorously and, at times, bitterly contested trial, demeaned himself with decorum and judicial dignity at all times and, for that reason, it seems to the Government that this case just does not come within the special rule of the Offutt case at all, but falls within the general principle of the Sacher case, namely, that a judge may, without losing his power to proceed summarily, defer the issuance of the certificate of contempt and the imposition of judgment until a time which, in his discretion and in his judgment, will not unduly interfere with the progress of the trial.</text>
