            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">It is my purpose to discuss and review the claims asserted on behalf of the United States for its federal establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.757" offset="166431">Arizona is naturally concerned both from the standpoint that such water is charged against the total entitlement or allotment that goes to the State of Arizona, also because substantial quantities of water are involved in an area which is in short supply of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.536" offset="269563">The claims asserted by the United States in this litigation aggregated a total diversion of water both mainstream and tributary, of an excess of 1,360,000 acre-feet per annum which would roughly equal a consumptive use of an excess of some-700,000 acre-feet per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.683" offset="418147">With respect to claims on tributary waters, the Master held that none of such claims presented a judicial -- a justiciable controversy except with respect to the tributary of the Gila River.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.873" offset="482826">The rights in that stream were adjudicated and the Master did submit a recommended disposal or disposition of the rights in those waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.627" offset="537893">In addition, the Master upheld the claims asserted by the United States as to mainstream federal establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.867" offset="598810">The amount of water allowed or recommended for those mainstream federal establishments aggregate a total diversion per year of 818,801 acre-feet which roughly would amount to a consumptive use in the neighborhood of 420,000 acre-feet per year.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.641" offset="1057938">Hereto fore, and I believe for about a half-a-century, the United States has urged upon this Court that it accept the principle that it owns all the unappropriated, non-navigable water within the public land states.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.591" offset="1497736">To give the Court an idea and quickly of what this means so far as Arizona and other public land states are concerned, I'll first take up the situation that exists in Arizona.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.606" offset="1769827">Now, the total lands owned by the United States within Arizona, they have been withdrawn or reserved so that they no longer occupy the status of public lands, that this lands which maybe disposed of and private interests required.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.516" offset="1849448">Those public lands constitute only roughly 24% of the government's total holdings in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.514" offset="1881422">In other words, there has already been withdrawn and reserved and placed in a withdrawn category a little more than 75% of the lands which the government owns in the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.290" offset="4348531">The Indian Agent by the name of Poston, who later was elected to Congress for the territory, met with the Indians of five tribes, either in 1963 of 1964 -- 1863 or 1864, I forgot which.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.416" offset="4433063">Now, those tribes were the Yumas, the Mohaves, the Yavapais, the Hualapais and the Chemehuevis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.023" offset="4463470">It was estimated, and only an estimate of the total population of those five tribes, some-10,000 Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.509" offset="4505370">Subsequent events have shown that estimate to be somewhat excessive, quite a bit excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.520" offset="4545494">Poston, through the Interior Department, recommended that those five tribes which, for the most part, had traditionally lived somewhere in that area along the river be given a reservation so that they could call that their home and that they take up agricultural pursuits and farm such of the reservation land as was needed to establish an agricultural economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.500" offset="4693347">The success of that effort I had planned or plan, I should say, I had expected to discuss later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.915" offset="4723022">That is the background of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.425" offset="4733053">I might say briefly that only one branch of the Mohaves and some Chemehuevis, for the main part, had taken advantage of that offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.899" offset="4774954">And, in fact, for each of those, as well as the other Indian tribes in Arizona and California, there has been another separate and distinct reservation created which is the home or abode of the various tribes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1511.390" offset="6148890">Now, on the Colorado Indian Reservation, as a result largely of the construction of Headgate Rock Diversion Dam, authorized by an Act of Congress in 1935, there had been, at one time or another but never at any one time, subjugated and irrigated on that reservation approximately 40,000 acres, not all by Indians but some portion of it being by White lessees or non-Indian lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.791" offset="6302490">The total amount farmed on that reservation, total acreage in 1953, was 29,534.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.484" offset="6341360">Of that total acreage, some-18,719 in that year was farmed by the Indians themselves and 10,000 plus the balance by non-Indian lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.128" offset="6399875">In 1954, practically the same amount of acreage was cultivated, a little larger, 29,957 but the Indians that year only farmed 15,153 and the non-Indian lessees framed over 14,000 or 14,804 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.726" offset="6490258">In 1955, which is the last year of record, of the 29,271 acres farmed on the Colorado River Indian Reservation, only 14,512 were farmed by Indians and by non-Indian lessees 14,759 or more than being farmed by the Indians themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.252" offset="6616377">One other fact I think is pertinent with respect to that reservation, and that is that the constructed works built there by the government are capable of serving some-60,000 acres with the addition only of laterals and subjugation of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.684" offset="6702059">It would require no extension of the main canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.066" offset="6715643">The diverting structure itself has a carrying capacity sufficient for the irrigation of 105,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.978" offset="6783248">Now, for that reservation, the recommended decree presented to this Court finds in Arizona 99,375 acres of irrigable lands, in California some-800 -- 8,213 acres or a total of 107,000 plus acres of irrigable lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.344" offset="6908740">The Master recommended that those lands have a diversion right from the mainstream, that is the Arizona portion, of 662,402 acre-feet per year or roughly a consumptive use, although it was not couched in that language, of some-330,000 acre-feet per year for the Ind -- for the Arizona portion of the Colorado River Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.230" offset="7032247">On the California side, he recommended a diversion right of 54,000-plus acre-feet per year which would equal a or result in the consumptive use of some-27,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.016" offset="7107480">So, the total consumptive use of that reservation per year would be 358,589 or at least it would be -- the water would be available for consumptive use if the land was ever used to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.933" offset="7179055">The diversion requirement would be some-770,000 acre-feet per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.656" offset="7213955">I'm going to pass on quickly to the other reservation, the Fort Mohave Indian Reservation, that includes an area of roughly some-31,000 acre-feet -- 1,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.831" offset="7314683">That was just originally set aside as the military reserve for military purposes in 1870.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.121" offset="7347806">It was transferred to the Department of Interior on September 18,, 1890 for the purpose of an industrial training school for Indian Youth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1834.627" offset="7441847">The total of lands ever irrigated on that reservation, the largest amount was 23 acres in the vicinity of the Indian school.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.639" offset="11929893">In addition, there's the Imperial National Wildlife Refuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.259" offset="11960404">That was established by Executive Order February 14, 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.506" offset="11981406">The total area located in Arizona and California is 50 -- some-51,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.002" offset="12011395">The Master recommended an annual diversion right of 28,000 acre-feet per year or a consumptive use of 23,000 acre-feet per year, or whichever is less, and that was not segregated or divided up as between states or as to which state would -- the allotment would be subtracted on amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.144" offset="12115989">Now, roughly, that covers the background as to the federal establishment on the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.415" offset="12161024">With respect to the tributary claims, the Master, as I indicated, refused to make an adjudication with respect to any claims of the government or any other parties on any of the tributaries except the Gila River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.883" offset="12246915">I will discuss the tributary water aspect to the government's claims later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.045" offset="12287561">Now, one thing I think I should make quite clear before I proceed further is that Arizona's quarrel with the -- these findings and these conclusions of law of the Master do not amount, as the Government assumes in its brief, to a contest, on the one hand, between the Indians in Arizona and, on the other hand, the non-Indians in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.807" offset="12482644">To make that quite clear, all I mean to do is to point out to Your Honors that, as we mentioned a moment ago, the central Arizona Project is the motivating cause of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.837" offset="12554742">Now, within that project, there are more Indians than the total number involved on these mainstream reservations, Indians who are in desperate need of water, as is much of the balance of that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.353" offset="12636766">On the Gila River Indian Reservation, which is for the Pima-Maricopa Tribes, the Master found that there resides on the reservation 5,700 Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.695" offset="12702177">That reservation is a part of what is known as the San Carlos Federal Irrigation Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.402" offset="12745017">It -- within that project, there are 50,000 acres of Indian-owned lands and 50,000 acres of non-India-owned lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.865" offset="12798830">It's a sort of a partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.221" offset="12812204">It was built as a result of the Act passed in 1924 by Congress providing for the construction of Coolie's Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.145" offset="12859956">The government fixed its estimate of the needs of the Indians when it found that that needs could be served by subjugating and irrigating some-50,000 acres of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.430" offset="12921083">It, likewise, was discovered that it was not economically feasible to build that inexpensive project for only 50,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.522" offset="12961416">So, an additional 50,000 acres of White-owned lands were included and it formed sort of a -- it is sort of a partnership between the Indians and non-Indians and, to my way of thinking, represents one of the best examples of how the Indians can join in the way of life of the non-Indians and improve their life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.361" offset="13076773">However, at the moment, their lot is, I must confess, is fairly pitiful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.511" offset="13105403">That area is almost invariably pointed to as the horrible example of what happens when you build a project and establish an economy, depend it on water from it, and the water either doesn't materialize or, for some reason or another, is substantially decreased.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.582" offset="13201742">The facts are that, of that 50,000 acres on the Indian Reservation, on the average for the years 1939 through 1955, the last year of record, the Indians were able to farm only half of it, less than half, 24,584 due entirely to water shortage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.068" offset="13607685">The situation is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.689" offset="13618134">We know very well that the amount of water that's available or will be available certainly won't be added, but to rescue all the areas in Arizona that need supplemental water supply is going to be a process of choosing and selecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.681" offset="13690128">It has to be that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.085" offset="13699741">You have the situation where the amount of acreage which has the need for water is larger than the water supply can be in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.310" offset="13744567">So, no one can say at this time precisely who's going to get water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.844" offset="13758777">I suspect there'll be trouble about that later on but, certainly, those Indians in that reservation is within the Central Arizona Project plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.869" offset="13802872">As I say, it's used as -- the Indians and their non-Indian partners are used as the horrible example of the effects of an insufficient water supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.880" offset="13850937">In addition, there is the Salt River Indian Reservation, which is 10 miles east of Phoenix, having a total area of only 47,000 acres, presently irrigated on that area some-12,000 acres, and there reside on that reservation members of the Pima-Maricopa Tribe aggregating approximately 1,500 Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.681" offset="14002134">Then, again, there is the Fort McDowell Indian Reservation which abuts on the northeast corner of the Salt River Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.049" offset="14047587">That's inhabited by 300 members of the Fort McDowell Mohave-Apache Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.583" offset="14085726">The irrigable lake which is of that reservation is some-1,300 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.966" offset="14099205">Its total area is 25,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.446" offset="14113207">In addition, there are other reservations in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.385" offset="14136926">The one I particularly call to mind is the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, while not within the Central Arizona Project area, the plan is at least are that by process of exchange of water, you see, they occupy the area in the White Mountains where they use water from White River which is -- in turn goes -- it flows into the Salt which in turn is the water supply for the area around Phoenix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.601" offset="14293765">There is litigation pending at present between the Salt River Valley Water Use Association and the tribe or its representatives over activities of the tribe in building dams for small lakes for recreational purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4058.952" offset="16339153">He considered that matter established by the Winters case and his report so states explicitly that we need not -- he need not, at least, and did not, I presume, inquire with respect to the source of that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.021" offset="16403414">Now, we regard all of these matters as of vital importance and I'm going to have to just hit the high places I can see with respect to our contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.058" offset="16455555">In the first place, the water involved on the mainstream is navigable water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.299" offset="16488573">Now, soon after the formation of this nation, this Court adjudicated with respect to the rights, on the one hand, of the national government and, on the other hand, the states regarding navigable water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.063" offset="16575613">Imported, as a part of the common law from England, was the concept that navigable waters are public waters, that they affect and concern the people as a whole in such vital respects as to demand or require that they'd be classified as public water, held, if held at all, by the sovereign and by the king in trust for the -- for the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.607" offset="16701837">On the other hand, non-navigable waters in England were regarded as not being public waters and not being of that significance to the people at large or as a whole, and they're classified as private water in which private rights might be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.053" offset="16787623">That distinction has been carried forward to this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.649" offset="16809984">I think we should keep in mind always that the basic classification is public water and private water, not navigable and non-navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.846" offset="16846764">It so happens that, in England, navigable waters fell under the category or classification of public water and non-navigable under the classification of private waters, but the basic fundamental distinction is whether or not the water is of such importance to the people as a whole as to justify its classification as public water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.745" offset="16954389">Now, it was early recognized that while -- during territorial status, while the United States held those lands as local, as well as national sovereign, that it held only in trust for the benefit of the future states and the people of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.060" offset="17047594">That, upon the admission to statehood or the creation of a state, automatically, that trust property went to the state and the state obtained full sovereignty and control over.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.020" offset="17115408">The theory, of course, being that, under our peculiar form of government, actually the people are sovereign and, except as they have delegated sovereign attributes to the national government, they remain in the people or the states for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.352" offset="17188760">And, the courts held that this was one respect in which sovereignty or sovereign prerogatives were not vested by the Constitution and the national government, so they remain and reposed in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.077" offset="17251662">Now, that rule has been followed without exception by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.821" offset="17282696">It's the law today just as it was then.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.008" offset="17295444">It's predicated in part on the requirement of a quality between states that the new states be permitted the same sovereign prerogative as ours in control as the older states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.550" offset="17373602">Obviously, a disposing of the navigable waters within a state prior to statehood means a contraction or lessening of the sovereignty of the state with respect to those waters.Now, that has an important bearing, as we see it, upon this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.583" offset="17493661">In the first place, as to the federal establishments created after statehood, the national government simply have no power, and had no ownership, no authority, or no sovereignty by which it could dispose of those navigable waters for the benefit of its own establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.177" offset="17576103">That power had ceased and it held it only as local sovereign while the territorial status remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.028" offset="17611525">But, upon the attainment of statehood, the only prerogative that the national government retained in navigable waters is under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.383" offset="17664920">That power of course is in terms, as this Court has said, is in terms of power and not of property and the limitations on that power, although the power is quite broad and extensive and much has been done by the national government pursuant to that power, obviously, there is a real distinction between the authority under the Commerce Clause with respect to navigable waters and, on the other hand, an ownership or complete sovereignty over those waters in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.557" offset="17829595">The fact that the waters are navigable also have, we think, this very vital bearing on the case and that is with respect to the manifestation of an intent due to -- let me explain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.097" offset="17895737">Due to the trust character in which these navigable waters are held by the national government and due to the fact that their disposal means a denial to some extent of sovereignty to the later state, the cases recognized that there is a presumption against disposal during territorial days by the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.826" offset="17998660">That to overcome that presumption, they -- there must be either an expressed statement of intent to do so or that intent must be made very clear from the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.858" offset="18062817">It need not be stated in so many words but there must be no doubt of what the government intended to dispose of that navigable water during the territorial days.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.849" offset="18118719">Now, the Master, in disposing of this phase of the case, and let me say now that I -- what I have been saying is not in criticism of the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.800" offset="18166575">Actually, we didn't give him much help, none of us did, on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.288" offset="18180472">I -- as he charitably remarked in the report, the attention and energies of the parties were devoted to other aspects of this case, and I plead guilty for Arizona in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.629" offset="18237837">I think it's true of all the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.972" offset="18255287">We simply were occupied with other matters and we did not make the presentation that we should've made with respect to these serious and intricate legal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.726" offset="18310248">Now, the Master found that all that was necessary was an implied intent and he relied upon circumstances as supplying that implied intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="4714.460" offset="18961220">In the first place, this is back in 1865 when there was an abundance of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4722.321" offset="18992671">Literally, millions of acre-feet per year flowed by that reservation unused and wasted into the gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.133" offset="19027884">The water was there for the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.566" offset="19037602">All you had to do was dig a ditch, get some other diversion structure, and put it to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.153" offset="19063933">Now, under the Arizona Law that existed at that time, that's likewise all you had to do to get an appropriative right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.760" offset="19094444">You only had to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.719" offset="19102281">You didn't even have to post a notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.860" offset="19114820">The statute respecting notice that was not passed by the Arizona territorial legislature until 1893 and the court held that, even then, its only application was with relation to the doctrine of relation back.</text>

            <text syncTime="4781.494" offset="19229341">So, to say that the government thought that the Indians -- “intend the Indians should use this water, therefore, it thought it must reserve them” does not follow because the mere use of it, which the government intended, would establish an appropriative right so that it was not at all necessary or essential to accomplish the end that Congress had in mind that it reserve, set aside, place in a safety deposit box, or some other fashion earmark a given quantity of water to make sure that the Indians got it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5636.419" offset="22649083">Now, as bearing on the -- that legislation, the Secretary of the Interior wrote a letter recommending the enactment of that legislation to the Chairman of the Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.503" offset="22713344">In that letter, he makes the significant statement that, "findings are being made by citizens and corporations upon the water to this river and, if rights are to be initiated,” rights are to be initiated, in other words, you don't have any.</text>
            <text syncTime="5671.522" offset="22789413">"for these Indian lands, the work should be started at an early date with a view to making a proper appropriation."</text>

            <text syncTime="5693.228" offset="22876244">Now, if they already have a reserved right to whatever amount they need, there's no occasion to initiate rights, there's no occasion to establish rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="5706.043" offset="22927548">You can't, to my way of thinking, reconcile those two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5712.352" offset="22952730">That initial Act of April 4, 1910 was followed by identical Acts for the next nine years with the exact language for the purpose of securing appropriation for water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.290" offset="23020544">So, for 10 successive years, Congress appropriated funds to enable the Indians in the Colorado River Reservation to secure a right in water by appropriation or pursuant to the appropriations doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.869" offset="23082820">As we view it, that was another action that indicated that Congress thought, particularly since it was navigable water, that the local laws and custom should be controlling and governing with respect to the acquisition of that right and that, also, it did not intend to impair the sovereignty of the future state by reserving or disposing of that navigable water in a special fashion or a special or a preferred use.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.033" offset="23219493">It's completely consistent with the many factors explained by the fact that the United States holds navigable water in trust for the benefit of the future states, but that isn't all with respect to the Acts of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.950" offset="23319176">Congress went on, following the Act of 1919, and continued to appropriate water -- money in connection with the building of irrigation facilities and referred back to the original Act of 1910 for the purpose of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5826.274" offset="23408515">That continued, as I recall, up to the year 1935 or 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.580" offset="23489703">Following that, there was a series of legislation on the part of Congress appropriating funds for the purchase of water rights and to ensure or protect against loss of water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5865.569" offset="23565667">Now, neither of those concepts can be reconciled with the reservation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.123" offset="23587819">You don't buy water rights if you already have a reserved right and you can't lose your water rights if you have a reserved right.</text>

            <text syncTime="5887.693" offset="23654170">Now, I see that my time is rapidly being exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5897.859" offset="23694817">I haven't, by any means, covered all the things that I intended to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="5909.479" offset="23741315">I'm going to briefly proceed, in a hit in cover and -- or to hit-and-run fashion, some of the more significant points that, unfortunately, I won't be able to elaborate on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.550" offset="23845595">We take a special exception to the irrigable acreage test as the criteria or the measurement of the Indian life.</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.963" offset="23927202">I think in order to get in proper perspective to examine that criteria, one has to appreciate the peculiar characteristics of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.058" offset="24011630">Unlike most things, if you don't use it, it's gone forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5980.928" offset="24027094">It flows on by and the use of it is forever gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5988.995" offset="24059382">In the arid West, conditions simply demand that there'd be a maximum utilization of that water supply because it forms the ceiling of growth and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="6001.209" offset="24108178">So that any approach to water which would result in a carving out, earmarking, or setting aside of a segment of the total supply which may not ever be used and certainly will not presently and for sometime to come be used is just simply an improvident way to deal with a product or a commodity or a substance to attend short supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="6037.686" offset="24254151">The whole effort in the arid area is to arrive at some sort of system or solution which will permit the broadest and widest utilization of that scarce resource rather than creating special rights and prerogatives in it which will not be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="6068.129" offset="24375881">You just -- we just don't do that with regard to water where it's so terribly valuable in such short supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="6082.032" offset="24431470">Now, there's one other thing that I think I should bring out to this Court here, a number that I would like to but I think I should clarify the position which we take in our brief with respect to the doctrine of equitable apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.357" offset="24528750">I don't believe that we clearly stated the limiting factors or the limited circumstances under which that doctrine may apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="6118.703" offset="24578173">Certainly, if this Court follows the reservation concept, if it likewise follows the recommendation of the Master with regard to present perfected rights, construes Section 6 of the Project Act as he's construed it, then the Project Act, in effect, has made an allocation to the Indians in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6143.779" offset="24678484">It recog -- it's not the source of the right anymore than it would be the source of other present perfected rights, but it recognizes and preserves them and, to that extent, makes a disposition of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6157.874" offset="24734908">Now, if that's done and if the Court considers that to be the law, one, that the reservation concept is correct, second, that it's a present perfected right and that present perfected rights are preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6171.532" offset="24789452">And, of course, there's no room for the application of the doctrine of equitable apportionment even with respect to Indian uses on the mainstream versus uses elsewhere in Arizona because the Project Act, having dealt with that matter, Congress having spoken, having made that distribution, there simply does not exist any situation in which the doctrine of equitable apportionment should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="6199.907" offset="24903032">One other matter has a bearing on that and that is that the Master construed the Arizona contract as authorizing the Secretary to contract with whom he pleased and for whatever amount he pleased in Arizona for the use of Lake Mead's water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6222.340" offset="24992684">We did not truly appreciate the significance of that ruling at the time as bearing on the equitable apportionment thing particularly and the rights of the Indians, but we have not accepted the Master's construction of our contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6238.401" offset="25056946">We think it's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.232" offset="25064260">Now, if that's right, the Secretary is the one to contract with everyone in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="6246.219" offset="25088293">Indians and non-Indians, it doesn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6249.381" offset="25100936">You can only get a right by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.466" offset="25113266">We can't buy the notion that he need not contract with himself, therefore, need not have any contract with the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.329" offset="25144717">As Your Honors know, quite often, there are so-called memoranda of understanding between departments or bureaus within the same department and certainly, for the sake of clarity and certainty, with respect to water commitments, a contract should be made with the Indians even though it's called a memorandum of understanding so that we'll all know exactly what the Secretary has done in that respect nor do we concede he has unlimited discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6297.570" offset="25293615">I'm sorry, I see my time is up.However, we have briefed the points -- most of the points that I had intend to cover very fully and I am content that our position be presented by our brief.</text>

          <heading>Argument of Burr Sutter</heading>
          <turn speaker="burr_sutter" startTime="6332.051" stopTime="6691.008">
            <label>Mr. Burr Sutter</label>
            <text syncTime="6332.051" offset="25431542">Mr. Justice Black and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6335.938" offset="25447111">The United States is a party to this litigation because it controls the waters impounded behind Hoover Dam and the associated works along the mainstream and, consequently, as Your Honors will recall, it was ruled in one of the earlier cases between Arizona and California that the United States was a necessary party to the adjudication of rights in the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="6366.058" offset="25567587">In addition, the Master has held, rightly we think, that the system for allocating or dividing, I use the word loosely, this water stems from a -- partly from a federal statue and partly from its implementation by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="6386.284" offset="25648462">And, we are in the case for that reason, too, because we think it appropriate to express our view as to the Acts of Congress and to explen -- explain and defend the contracts made by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="6404.216" offset="25720247">Being in the case for those reasons, it seemed appropriate to my predecessor, as well as to myself, that the United States should speak for what we conceive to be the general interest in the apportionment of this water, the national interest in the best development of the whole South West Region.</text>
            <text syncTime="6422.508" offset="25793390">And, finally, we are here of course on behalf of the Indians to whom the United States has a duty as trustee and, to that aspect of the case, we make what perhaps might be called “proprietary claims” as distinguished from the general governmental position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6442.028" offset="25871444">It's helpful I think if I begin by trying to outline the main divisions of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6449.627" offset="25901850">I find it convenient to think of it in three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6453.863" offset="25918777">The first I would describe is the interstate controversy over the waters of the Colorado River, the mainstream and some associated waters, which just arises between California and the other Lower Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6470.767" offset="25986487">In the second division, I would put certain incidental questions which arise assuming if the Court accepts the main thesis of the Master's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="6482.160" offset="26032044">Without stopping now to state them in detail, one illustration is the question of whether the mainstream above Lake Mead should be treated as subject to the apportionment, whether the Secretary's contracts are valid in that respect or not, and there's certain other incidental questions of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="6502.471" offset="26113233">Then, the third division is the one which has been discussed this morning by Mr. Reed to what the claims of the United States for water for the Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6513.863" offset="26158791">I'll discuss the three main divisions in the orders I've just states.</text>
            <text syncTime="6520.767" offset="26186480">The first division then is the interstate controversy over the apportionment of the waters impounded by Hoover Dam and controlled by the federal works along the mainstream of the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="6537.549" offset="26253563">Here, instead of listing the issues, I find it convenient myself, and perhaps the Court will, well, to think of this as a contest between two main conceptions of the way this water is to be divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="6552.190" offset="26312182">One, I shall state it as that of the United States for it's essentially the same as that of the Master and of Arizona and, on the other hand, California's concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="6564.686" offset="26362128">Our view takes it as a premise that the Colorado River Compact apportions seven-and-a half million acre-feet to the Upper Basin, subject to the obligation to deliver an average of seven-and-a half million acre-feet every 10 years, 75 million feet over a decade, at Lee Ferry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6589.314" offset="26460662">So, that might, under certain circumstances in terms of supply, cut into the seven-and-a half million feet that the Upper Basin may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="6599.082" offset="26499741">What we'd -- I want to make it plain that there is nothing that the Court should do here as a matter of law or should necessarily decide as a matter of implication that would constitute a precedent the future, cutting into the Upper Basin's seven-and-a half million acre-feet subject to its Article III (d) obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6625.270" offset="26604440">Now, whether the Upper Basin can ever use seven-and-a half million acre-feet is a question of fact which has been discussed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6633.529" offset="26637458">There are some people who think they're inherent physical limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6637.338" offset="26652714">I don't urge them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6638.325" offset="26656684">I'm simply stating the reason for the references to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6642.044" offset="26671522">We take it, that they're to have their seven-and-a half million acre-feet subject to the obligation to send 75 million down every 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6653.302" offset="26716557">Within the Lower Basin, with decisive fact in our judgment, is that the United States built Hoover Dam and the incidental work, thereby, making the Colorado River manageable and greatly increasing the supplies of usable water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6672.978" offset="26795238">Project Act, as we see it, is concerned with the disposition of those impounded waters, with the disposition of the waters of the mainstream flowing down from Lee Ferry and with the tributaries flowing into Lake Mead above Hoover Dam.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="6691.008" offset="26867440">On this part, you agree then with the position of Arizona as distinguished from the position of California?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="burr_sutter" startTime="6698.093" stopTime="6758.472">
            <label>Mr. Burr Sutter</label>
            <text syncTime="6698.093" offset="26895757">No, I think I would state it the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="6700.404" offset="26904952">We think that the Master erred in invalidating the provisions of the Secretary's contracts which say that, out of Arizona's share of the water covered by the contract, 2.8 million acre-feet, there is to be deducted anything Arizona takes out above Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="6723.453" offset="26997217">We think mainstream means mainstream all the way down the river and not -- I'll have the maps changed at lunch, and not depart that Mr. Ely said -- quite properly said.</text>
            <text syncTime="6735.378" offset="27044864">The Master had truncated above Lake Mead itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6739.864" offset="27062836">So, on that part, we disagree with the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="6745.677" offset="27086033">Arizona agrees with the Master and, I take it, that California thinks it was a silly division, although the conclusions it draws are somewhat different than ours.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="6758.472" offset="27137233">Pardon me, Mr. Sutter, I don't want to delay you but you made one suggestion there that Ariz -- that the Upper Basin would not be disturbed so long as it sends down seven-and-a half million feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6774.821" offset="27202644">Does that mean that we have to decide here or that we could decide so it provide in the Upper Basin?</text>
            <text syncTime="6781.878" offset="27230856">They're required to send 7,500,000 feet, although they do not yet use that much in the Upper Basin.</text>

          <turn speaker="burr_sutter" startTime="6789.308" stopTime="6984.640">
            <label>Mr. Burr Sutter</label>
            <text syncTime="6789.308" offset="27260635">I don't -- I don't think -- I didn't do anymore -- mean to do anymore than state what I understood to be an accepted meaning of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6797.624" offset="27293863">If there is any doubt about that, then I think it should not be adjudicated here and it could not be properly adjudicated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6807.316" offset="27332629">I didn't want to simply say seven-and-a half million acre-feet because there is this Article III (d) obligation, whatever it may mean, but I don't think its meaning has to be adjudicated or should be really it's required and what's really required to reason about it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6827.117" offset="27411832">Certainly, not reason about it in a sense of deciding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6829.736" offset="27422281">One may wish, as Justice Frankfurter suggested, to consider the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="6834.779" offset="27442448">He has to consider the relationship of the Compact with the statute, but I don't think he has to reach any conclusion about the meaning of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6846.424" offset="27489050">We also think, like the Master, that the Project Act supplies the guidelines for an apportionment of the waters impounded behind Boulder Dam and that it authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to implement that statutory plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6866.063" offset="27567626">It states, you'll recall, that there should be no rights in any water impounded except by contract with the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="6875.218" offset="27604198">It then states that present perfected rights are all to be protected and, in our view, this established cutoff point, to use Justice Black's expression of a few days ago, at 1928 and said rights that were vested before 1928 are to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="6894.581" offset="27681729">As to the rest, we're going to have a new start in accordance with the scheme envisaged by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6902.699" offset="27714121">Section 4 in the California Limitation Act in effect, also they used the words "limit," gave California 4.6 million acre -- 4.4 million acre-feet out of the waters of the Colorado River, 4.6 out of the first 7.5 and then one-half of any waters in the Colorado River in addition to the 7.5.</text>
            <text syncTime="6931.066" offset="27827597">Nature, itself, pretty well supplied the rest of the apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6935.882" offset="27846928">Everyone agreed, at that time, that Nevada needed only 300,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6941.482" offset="27869288">It could use only 300,000 acre-feet, and even Nevada's higher estimate didn't go much over 400,000 acre-feet at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6952.730" offset="27914324">The suggested Compact in the second paragraph of Section 4 (a), we think, gave further guidelines to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6961.089" offset="27947760">And then, rounding this out, in our view, the Secretary's Comp -- the Secretary's contracts within the guidelines laid down by the statute did make a final interstate apportionment of seven-and-a half million acre-feet 4.4 to California, 300,000 to Nevada, and 2.8 to Arizona.</text>

            <text syncTime="6998.916" offset="28099062">It seems to us that the Project Act left -- gave the Secretary sufficient guidelines so that there were limitations of what he could do but it also was left to him to move around a bit within the guidelines and to fill in the structure and flush out the bond by his contract, which we think he did by the contracts in evidence that I'll refer to later in detail.</text>
