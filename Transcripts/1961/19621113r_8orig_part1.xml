            <text syncTime="135.862" offset="646771">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.763" offset="658474">California has two basic exceptions to the report of the Special Master which is before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.814" offset="682611">These relate primarily to his interpretation of Section 5 and Section 4 (a) of the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.183" offset="732139">Section 5 appears at the pages 384 and 385 of his report and in essence, it provides so far as water for consumptive use is concerned, that the Sectary of Interior is authorized under general regulations which he may prescribe to contract for the storage of water in the reservoir and for its delivery on such points upon the river or the canal, meaning the all-American canal, as he may agree upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.095" offset="871737">It provides that contracts for water for irrigation and domestic use shall be for permanent service and shall conform to paragraph (a) of Section 4 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.359" offset="916773">The final sentence upon which the Master relies heavily provides that no person shall have or be entitled to have the use for any purpose of the water stored as aforesaid except by a contract made as herein stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.903" offset="978944">Section 4 (a) of the Act appears beginning at pages 300 -- page 381 of the Report and in essence, it provides this.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.091" offset="1023770">This statute as you may recall authorized the construction of a dam, now known as Hoover Dam, and of the all-American canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.351" offset="1056789">And the grant of the consent of Congress to the Colorado River Compact, an agreement which had been signed by representatives of the seven States of the Basin in 1922 had been ratified by six, but Arizona had refused to ratify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.483" offset="1117288">Section 4 (a) provides that the Act shall not become effective until these seven States shall have ratified the Compact or in the alternative, if seven shall fail to ratify within six months after the effective date of the Act, then until six who ratified including California, and in addition, California in that event should have enacted a limitation upon her use of the waters of the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.342" offset="1232750">This limitation is stated on page 382, about two-thirds of the way down appear the operative words.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.555" offset="1269635">It provides that the legislature of California shall pass an Act which shall limit California's uses of the water to two components: first, not to exceed 4,400,000 acre-feet per annum of diversions less returns consumptive use of the waters apportioned to the Lower Basin States by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado River Compact plus not to exceed one-half of the excess or surplus waters unapportioned by the Compact, such uses always to be subject to the terms of the said Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.072" offset="1423653">The Colorado River Compact, to which reference is made, appears at page 373 of the Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.934" offset="1467120">Article III (a), apportions to the Upper Basin and to the Lower Basin respectively, in perpetuity the beneficial consumptive use of 7,500,000 acre-feet per annum of the waters of the Colorado River System.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.978" offset="1531277">The System is defined in Article II as including the main river and its tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.240" offset="1552384">The 7,500,000 acre-feet shall include all water necessary for the supply of any rights which may now exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.355" offset="1600763">The two issues involved in these two sections are -- I'll illustrate in a moment by reference to the map which is behind me.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.630" offset="1641932">But in essence, they are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.050" offset="1659591">Section 4 (a) required of California a covenant, an agreement with the legislates -- between the legislature of California and the Congress of United States which is explicit a limitation in two categories: 4,400,000 acre-feet plus one-half of the excess or surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.958" offset="1739212">California enacted that limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.379" offset="1748929">We undertook that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.202" offset="1756139">The President so proclaimed and the Act became effective because we did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.646" offset="1777977">We say that the figure of 4,400,000 acre-feet is a quantitative limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.244" offset="1804309">It is the absolute minimum, the irreducible minimum of the requirements of California's projects and that we agreed to prorate with other users the excess and sub-surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.184" offset="1860106">We agreed to limit ourselves to one-half of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.414" offset="1877034">The Master construes Section 5 as authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to treat these 4,400,000 acre-feet not as a quantitative limitation, as an irreducible minimum as we call it, but as simply one component, not a contractual allocation scheme that is, that Section 5 delegated to the Secretary of the Interior to “impose a federal apportionment” upon these States if they should fail to agree upon an interstate compact and that the Secretary did so by contracts which he made with users in California in 1931 to 1934 and with Arizona and Nevada, those two States in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.856" offset="2066787">That is to say that they came into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.155" offset="2075982">In 1944, a contractual apportionment made by the Secretary which had the effect of imposing upon these three States a proration scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.555" offset="2125615">The decree would put the -- this result into effect that if the Secretary releases from Lake Mead enough water to sustain 7,500,000 acre-feet per annum of consumptive use below Lake Mead, that seven and a half million shall be apportioned 4,400,000 acre-feet to California, 2,800,000 acre-feet to Arizona, 300,000 acre-feet to Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.296" offset="2232508">The latter two figures being derived from the 1944 contracts, the 4,400,000 figure being the first component of our limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.061" offset="2267617">If there's excess, if the Secretary releases enough water to sustain more than seven and a half million acre-feet of consumptive use, that excess is to be divided one-half to California, one-half to Arizona and Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.848" offset="2322787">But, and here is the rub, if the Secretary releases insufficient water to sustain 7,500,000 acre-feet of consumptive use from Lake Mead and below, then the supply made available shall be prorated.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.141" offset="2379943">California shall have forty-four seventy fifths of the quantity which the Secretary in his discretion neglects to make available, Arizona twenty-eight seventy fifths, Nevada three seventy fifths.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.713" offset="2434173">With the result that California cannot have the 4,400,000 acre-feet to which we agreed, we may have forty-four seventy fifths of X, X being the quantity which the Secretary in his discretion decides to make available.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.968" offset="2499271">The difficulty with this is that, if the Colorado River Compact is enforced, the Secretary is precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.615" offset="2529782">If he obeys the Compact, which the statute tells that we must for making available below Lake Mead enough water so that forty-four seventy fifths of it is 4,400,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.777" offset="2578474">In short, the Master construes Section 5 as delegating to the Secretary the authority to use the 4,400,000 acre-feet which is our limitation as a starting point for further reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.773" offset="2638451">We construe Section 4 (a) as imposing a quantitative limitation upon the rights of California to stored water or in a natural flow and accumulatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.648" offset="2689964">And we attribute to Section 5 not the authority to impose a -- an interstate apportionment by contract with the States individually but as simply to make users in these States contracts of a type familiar in the reclamation law since 1902, contracts which with actual users, give to those users rights to appropriate stored water and that the rights in that stored water are required not by the contract in a form of a grant or a patent but in a form -- but by putting the water to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.676" offset="2834056">That is in a classic language of Section 8 of the reclamation law, “beneficial use is the basis, the measure, and the limit of the right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="692.112" offset="2871777">Now, the map behind me illustrates both of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.901" offset="2891003">It shows in two colors, the waters of the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.121" offset="2915871">The Lower Basin as defined in the Compact includes the main river from Lee Ferry to the Mexican boundary and it includes all the tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.704" offset="2954219">These tributaries are primarily the Gila River which rises in Western New Mexico traverses Arizona and discharges into the Colorado near Yuma.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.216" offset="2996224">The Little Colorado which rises in Northwestern New Mexico crosses a corner of Arizona and discharges into the Colorado, the Virgin River which arises in Utah and crosses a corner of Arizona and a portion of Nevada before reaching the main river.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.437" offset="3069158">The resources of the Lower Basin quantitatively are somewhat like this.Coming in at Lee Ferry, the river brings from the Upper Basin, waters which are controlled by the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.428" offset="3129135">Article III (d) of that Compact provides that the four upper States: Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, shall not deplete the flow of the river at Lee Ferry below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre-feet in any period of 10 consecutive years.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.205" offset="3196217">The Lower Basin tributaries according to Arizona's evidence supplied about 3,000,000 acre-feet per year to the main river.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.454" offset="3233207">Of this about half or about a million and a half was supplied by the Gila and about half accumulatively by the Little Colorado, the Virgin and the other Lower Basin tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.798" offset="3278555">These are the waters of the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.575" offset="3297677">With respect to Section 4 (a), the cross reference to paragraph (a) of Article III, if it is read as written means that California is restricted to 4,400,000 acre-feet of a 7,500,000 acre-feet of consumptive use which is sustained by the main river and the tributaries that is the stream shown in both blue and red on this map and is excluded from 3,100,000 acre-feet of the waters apportioned by Article III (a) found in the same fund of water, tributaries and main river and excluded from half the excess or surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.717" offset="3470190">Now, the Master construes Section 4 (a) at page 173 of his Report as making an inappropriate reference to Article III (a) of the Colorado River Compact and about the center of the page appears his key holding with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.679" offset="3550124">He says, “Thus I hold at Section 4 (a) of the Project Act and the California Limitation Act refer only to the water stored in Lake Mead and flowing in the mainstream below Hoover Dam.”</text>
            <text syncTime="875.449" offset="3605191">Despite the fact that Article III (a) of the Compact deals with the Colorado River System which is defined in Article II (a) as including the main -- the entire mainstream and the tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.909" offset="3650957">That is to say the Master construes Section 4 (a) as intending to fine for California the 4,400,000 and to fine for Arizona, and California and Nevada the 3,100,000 out of that segment of the Lower Basin waters colored red on this map.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.993" offset="3731310">The result is that 3,100,000 acre-feet which if the Compact referenced in 4 (a) means what it says, must be supplied by the tributaries as well as the main river shall be supplied from Lake Mead alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.483" offset="3793272">The Colorado River Compact does not make available to the Secretary, water in sufficient quantity to sustain 7,500,000 acre-feet from the Red River, Lake Mead and below, it makes that quantity available out of the whole Lower Basin, blue plus red.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.133" offset="3859937">Consequently, the problem with respect to Section 4 (a) is simply this, may Arizona and Nevada having exhausted a portion of the Compact apportionment to the Lower Basin by the uses on the tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.488" offset="3929318">Nevertheless, claim that same quantity a second time out of Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.402" offset="3952933">The consumptive uses which are in fact sustained by these tributaries measured as diversions less returns are of the order of 2,000,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.918" offset="3991071">That is to say that tributaries supply to the main river and the state of nature about 3,000,000 and about 2,000,000 of that is now consumed and has been for many years by projects located on these tributaries, primarily, in the Phoenix area on the Gila River.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.618" offset="4049795">That 2,000,000 acre-feet plainly according the Master is chargeable to consumes -- burdens up exactly that same quantity of the apportionment to the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.162" offset="4095979">Consequently, that use on the tributaries has reduced in precisely that amount the quantity that Arizona, California and Nevada may claim or may appropriate out of the main river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.533" offset="4149478">May Arizona and Nevada nevertheless, having reduced the quantity available in the aggregate to California, Arizona, Nevada by those uses on the tributaries, claim that use a second time, this time C</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.752" offset="4250415">The greater part of it Mr Justice Goldberg, in Arizona, we calculate about 50,000 acre-feet or thereabouts, in New Mexico about a million 700 odd thousand in a -- on the Gila and Arizona and the balance of the 2,000,000 is made up by uses on the other tributaries primarily the Little Colorado and to some degree the Virgin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.378" offset="4352920">With respect to Section 5, the Master equates Section 5 with Section 4 (a), that is to say, he says that Section 5 applies to the Red River, Lake Mead and below and indeed it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.664" offset="4414046">That is the authority given to the Secretary to contract for storage in Lake Mead and deliver that water below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.233" offset="4440273">And he construes Section 5 as being a delegation to the Secretary to impose a federal apportionment upon the States if they don't agree to apportion among themselves the water referred to in Section 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.579" offset="4493667">We say there is no identity, whatever between these two funds of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.484" offset="4513311">The authority given to the Secretary in Section 5 relates to only a segment of the Lower Basin waters which are covered by Section 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.200" offset="4556152">Now there are, nevertheless, substantial areas of agreement between the Master and ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.561" offset="4593664">He finds or he concludes that in the event of shortage in the so-called -- what I call the Red River, that is Lake Mead to the Mexican boundary, this shortage shall be disposed of by respect for the law which prevails generally throughout the Colorado River Basin, that is a law of priority of appropriation and this Court's doctrine of equitable apportionment and with certain exceptions, the exceptions are important and decisive but the general principally accepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.476" offset="4729292">This Court's doctrine of equitable apportionment course contains two primary elements as you have pounded it out here on the envelope, Nebraska versus Wyoming and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.288" offset="4780492">The first is a recognition of interstate priorities of appropriation and the second is the protection of existing uses, even the projects with junior appropriations are protected against the destruction of their economy by senior appropriations and whereas in our case, the two situations merged at the existing economy as based upon senior appropriations, the reasons for the two rules uniting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.481" offset="4889266">Now, the Master applies -- spells it out, applies the doctrine of interest -- of equitable apportionment and the principles of priority in a number of instances and does it very illusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.871" offset="4938898">He applies this principle of equitable apportionment for example on deciding the issues between New Mexico and Arizona on the Gila River.</text>

            <text syncTime="1871.007" offset="7587401">Nobody knew what it would be until 1944 but the California projects were built during precisely this period between 1929 and 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.948" offset="7631182">The youngest of them, the Metropolitan Water Districts, Colorado River Aqueduct was completed in 1941.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.196" offset="7696175">But that retroactively, this contractual allocation scheme, this proration formula was imposed upon us in 1944 and that the bargain that controls this is not that made between the legislature of California and the Congress of the United States in 1929, a limitation act which fixed a quantitative limitation of 4,400,000 acre-feet upon our contracts and our appropriative rights under state law but it was fixed in 1944 by a proration formula in which our 4,400,000 acre-feet is just one component, the starting point for a reduction downgrade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.721" offset="7842252">We say that we are entitled to rely upon the contract made, the bargain made in 1929 with the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.880" offset="7918843">And that somehow the Secretary of the Interior had promulgated regulations, say in 1930 or 1931, the same in effect the statute provides the States can agree.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.250" offset="7968371">The statute provides that in that event I may impose a federal apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.760" offset="7982373">I now do so and in the following terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.169" offset="7996061">I don't like interstate priorities, I prorate and I now decide that I'm going to make a contract with Arizona for 2,800,000 acre-feet and with Nevada for 300,000 and I impose proration in the event of shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.098" offset="8055724">And furthermore, I'm going to find all of this water out of Lake Mead, although the Boulder Canyon Project Acts as I must conform to the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.294" offset="8088534">I think that Section 4 (a) made it inappropriate reference to the Colorado River Compact says the Secretary in these hypothetical regulations in 1930 or 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.535" offset="8125524">I think what Congress really meant was to divide up 7,500,000 acre-feet of consumptive use below Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.518" offset="8153422">Now, if any Secretary has sat down and done that in 1930 or 1931, it needs no elaboration to say that that kind of an interpretation of the statute by general regulations would've been promptly corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.472" offset="8205249">The Secretary never did that.You would expect to find this the most important single act of any Secretary of the Interior in the history of our country, one that divides the waters of a great river which imposes to use the Master's word, imposes a federal apportionment upon the States would've been spelled out in regulations, unless a statute authorize general regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.120" offset="10071855">Section 4 (a) demonstrates how Congress knew how to draw the difference between a quantitative limitation of 4,400,000 acre-feet on the one hand and a fractional allocation, one-half of the excess or surplus on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.450" offset="10133191">Had it intended to treat 4,400,000 acre-feet as simply the numerator in a fraction, it was very easy to say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.496" offset="10165373">If Congress meant not 4,400,000 acre-feet but 44 seventy-fifths, it was just as easy to say that as it was to say one-half of the excess or surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.916" offset="10207065">It didn't do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2534.918" offset="10243009">It's a limitation upon rights derived from other sources.</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.979" offset="12023306">Certainty, you can get certainty under the appropriation law because you can ascertain what priorities are superior to yours, you build -- you are protected against juniors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.978" offset="12067297">You do not face the possibility that some administrative officer 15 years later after you built will impose a proration formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.811" offset="12098644">The law of appropriation gives stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.356" offset="12108779">Permanent service was intended, says the Master to give stability, to do more than simply outlaw term contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.278" offset="12136469">Section 5 provides that it is -- shall -- the Secretary's contract shall conform to Section 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.168" offset="12164054">We say conform means conform and doesn't mean that the Secretary may reduce our 4,400,000 acre-feet by a proration formula discovered 15 years later and imposed by a contract then made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.827" offset="12222673">And to come to the ultimate of the application of the Master's contrary theory of what Section 5 meant, he holds that the Arizona contract which purports to allocate to Arizona 50% of the excess or surplus, and to give Cal -- Nevada a right to 4% of that 50% that that contract made with Arizona by implication reserves to California one-half of the excess or surplus because the only contractor to give half of it Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.288" offset="12364570">Now, think what this means, this means that our right to one-half of the excess or surplus, however you define excess or surplus, doesn't originate in the Section 4 (a) of the Project Act, the bargain we made with Congress by passing our limitation act, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.770" offset="12430503">But we got our right to one-half of the excess or surplus by implication and the terms of the contract made with by the Secretary of the Interior with Arizona 15 years later and that's where Nevada got 4% of excess or surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.806" offset="12486614">Now, we say you can't read into Section 5 any kind of a delegation like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.024" offset="12507512">We made our bargain in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.172" offset="12516080">We're not dependent for our right to one-half for excess or surplus upon an implied reservation made by the Secretary in the contract to somebody else 15 years later and three years after our projects were completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.755" offset="12586402">We say that Section 5 was controlled also by Section 18 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.362" offset="12612838">Section 18 appears at page 395 and it says that nothing herein shall be construed as interfering with such rights as the States now have either to the waters within their borders or to adopt such policies and enact such laws as they may be necessary with respect to the appropriation, control and use of waters within their borders -- pardon, except as modified by the Colorado River Compact or other interstate agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.835" offset="12766751">That section went into the Act as an amendment offered by Senator King of Utah who had become vastly disturbed by the representation of Senator Hayden that this Act somehow is going to authorize some kind of a federal apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.252" offset="12824430">Hayden was talking not about Arizona versus California but the imposition of the Colorado River Compact upon Arizona without her consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.487" offset="12857344">And Senator King after a famous colloquy with Hayden in which he denied the power of the Federal Government to put its hands on a river in that fashion offered Section 18, it was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.983" offset="12899349">After that, King supported the Act, the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.328" offset="12912724">This Section 18 is given respect by the Master, intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.887" offset="12934875">He uses it to buttress his conclusion that within the State priorities of contract holders controlled their relative rights in reliance upon Section 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.602" offset="12985762">He believes and we are willing to an extent, he believes that a Section 5 contract putting to one side this interstate apportionment effect to the Arizona contract, a Section 5 contract with the water user doesn't necessarily give that water user a water right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.373" offset="13060890">State law determines that that the user must find under state law under Section 18 a right to take and receive that water and Section 5 is the Secretary's consent that he may do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.326" offset="13112717">Now, Section 18 was given interstate effect by this Court and refers to Arizona versus California case in 283 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.668" offset="13150020">Arizona sued here to enjoin the construction of Hoover Dam and to have the Colorado River Compact declared inoperative on two grounds: One that the construction of the dam would invade her sovereignty; second, as she put it that the mere existence of the Act, Section 5 I supposed, would prevent the State of Arizona to an exercise in her sovereignty to prevent or permit appropriations of water from the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.103" offset="13259734">Mr. Justice Brandies for this Court quoted Section 18, held that nothing in this Act, the Boulder Canyon Project Act, interferes with Arizona's right to initiate or perfect appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.416" offset="13321070">Now, if Judge Rifkind is correct, the Court must've been mistaken in 283 U.S. because the whole premise of this report of the Special Master is that the Project Act had done exactly what Arizona then complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.004" offset="13387421">It had cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.948" offset="13391182">It had ended the right of States to appropriate the waters of the Colorado River below Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.299" offset="13416573">If the Master is right, you got such a right only out of a federal contract and in the Secretary's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.393" offset="13448965">Before I leave Section 8 of the reclamation law, I've talked now about Section 18 of the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.430" offset="13473102">Let me revert to Section 8 of the reclamation law incorporated by Section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.700" offset="13494209">This Court in Wyoming versus Colorado and Nebraska versus Wyoming cited Section 8 in interstate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.302" offset="13524616">You treated it not as necessarily applying a State appropriation to control the federal official but as expressing the intent of Congress to treat as federal interstate common law the principle established by state law of priorities of appropriation applied across state lines that as federal law, you picked up the philosophy of a western law of appropriation in Section 8 for the Reclamation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.020" offset="13639450">And we think the Master is wrong in restricting Section 8 to intrastate effect as he also restricts Section 18 of the Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.929" offset="13687097">In the United States versus Arizona, this Court again had occasion to consider the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.007" offset="13719385">This was the case as you may remember in which Arizona had called out the militia to stop the construction of Parker Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.548" offset="13749582">The United States sued to enjoin that military interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.877" offset="13762853">The injunction was denied because of lack of the authority of the unite -- of the Secretary's statutory authority to build the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.285" offset="13788557">But in the course of that opinion, this Court said that Arizona owns the land under this navigable stream to the thread of the stream and has a right to appropriate an equitable share of the flow of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.549" offset="13841533">And the Court cited Section 14 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act as incorporating -- as incorporating the reclamation law, the Court went on to say that Arizona had this right unaffected by any provision of the Colorado River Compact or a federal reclamation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.298" offset="13908616">Now, if the Master is right, that pronouncement by this Court in United States versus Arizona must have been mistaken because if he is right, the Project Act had cut off Arizona's right to appropriate the waters of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.548" offset="14005582">In short, the Master deduces from the existence of contracts made some 15 years apart, the Arizona contract of 1944 or contracts made in 1931 to 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.426" offset="14053125">A contractual allocation scheme and apportionment as -- so that had been made by the statute, not by the statute itself, I should be clear upon that but by the Secretary immediately after enactment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.975" offset="14115297">If you look at the Arizona contract itself, you don't find any support for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.350" offset="14136822">If any contractual allocation scheme, any federal apportionment was ever created, that's the single piece of paper that did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.795" offset="14166601">You don't find the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.390" offset="14172975">You don't find any document with a signature of the Secretary that can have any such effect except the Arizona contract, and it doesn't purport to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.264" offset="14212472">This contract says that it is made pursuant to the provisions of the reclamation law including the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.547" offset="14241520">It provides that the Secretary of the Interior agrees to deliver to make contracts, to make contracts with users in Arizona who may qualify under the reclamation law, but that he will make such contracts only up to a total delivery obligation of 2,800,000 acre-feet of consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.448" offset="14329187">But in Section -- in Article VII now, he provides that this contract does not impair any present perfected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.138" offset="14363878">And speaking of 1944, that's three years after our con -- our projects were completed in operation, 1944 present perfected rights, what does it mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.968" offset="14411212">It is surely a promise of respect by the Secretary for the doctrine of priority of appropriation interstate, what were the present perfected rights except ours?</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.443" offset="14457187">It also provides in so many words in Article X that nothing in this contract shall be deemed to determine the allocation to any State of the waters apportioned by any category of the Colorado River Compact in order to determine any question of interstate priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.075" offset="14527718">In an accompanying decision by the Secretary of the Interior in 1944, he said that this language of Article X was intended to reserve for a judicial determination all of these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.327" offset="14580694">We say it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.620" offset="14589889">That there does not exist any document which effects a -- an interstate apportionment, none ever purported to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.830" offset="14618728">This is a synthesis by the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.267" offset="14640462">Now, I referred earlier to what had happened in this 15-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.846" offset="14666794">Let me emphasize it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.833" offset="14682676">In 1931, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California entered into a contract with the United States in 1930 and 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.585" offset="14729697">Under both Sections 5 and Section 4 (b) of this Act, Section 4 (b) provided that the Secretary of the Interior should not undertake the construction of Hoover Dam unless and until he had in hand contracts which would liquidate the Government's investment with interest and plus operation and maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.187" offset="14816110">He was able to do this by making power contracts and contracts of the storage and delivery of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.795" offset="14838575">The first grade -- when he made was with the Metropolitan Water District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.841" offset="14850696">It committed itself to pay for 36% of the firm energy to be generated in Hoover Dam, to be paid for whether used or not but to be used only for pumping water into and in the aqueduct to propose the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.740" offset="14902314">The Project Act's legislative history is full of references through the intent of this project to furnish water for the coastal plain of Southern California to an aqueduct to be built by these cities at their own expense however.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.853" offset="14962813">These two contracts remained, the water contract provides for permanent service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.940" offset="14983084">In 1931, the Secretary about to make a contract under Section 4 (b) as well as Section 5 with the -- those to use the all-American canal called upon the perspective users in California to get together with the State and submit a schedule of internal priorities to which Mr. Justice Stewart referred earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.847" offset="15066781">This was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.980" offset="15075244">That is incorporated in all of the California water contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.063" offset="15091649">It provides respect for the California priorities internally at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.763" offset="15114428">It -- the figures in it are not taken out of the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.903" offset="15130937">The relative priority dates are those established by state law appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.172" offset="15148074">The quantities are those appropriated under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.218" offset="15160195">The Secretary agrees to deliver those quantities subject to the availability of water in California under the Project Act in the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.308" offset="15192586">The Metropolitan Water District proceeded to construct this aqueduct, sold over $200 million worth of bonds but it didn't do that until this Court's decision had come down in 283 U.S. in which you construed Section 18 as sustaining interstate -- the priorities acquired under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.711" offset="15266252">At least you said that -- the Court said that Arizona's right to appropriate was not cut off by the Project Act and you've cited Section 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.232" offset="15312332">They were senior to the Metropolitan Water District, the rights of the other agriculture users in California, the Palo Verde Irrigation District, the Imperial Irrigation District and the Coachella Valley County Water District to the extent of 3,850,000 acre-feet, the Metropolitan's contract call 4,212,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.796" offset="15386520">Only half of that is within our 4,400,000, 550,000, 612,000 is dependent upon the availability of excess or surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.251" offset="15432391">The District proceeded to bill this aqueduct at its own expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.823" offset="15446706">It went into service in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.662" offset="15462066">Never throughout any of this history was there any indication from anyone that the Secretary of the Interior believed that he had been delegated power by Congress to cut down the 4,400,000 acre-feet by an interstate apportionment he might later make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.982" offset="15527267">In fact, the district's contracts were before Congress on three separate occasions in an Act which authorized a right of way for this aqueduct across public lands in an Act which ratified this Parker Dam contracts and gave the Secretary power to build it after the adverse decision in United States versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.904" offset="15594977">And finally in 1941, when the Congress passed the Boulder Canyon Project Adjustment Act which in terms requires the Secretary of the Interior to rely upon this District for some 35% of the funds to repay the cost of Hoover Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.818" offset="15650670">And in 1941, in that same statute, Congress reenacted Section 18 provided in so many words that the provisions of the Project Act should continue to be operative except as special -- specifically amended here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.337" offset="15716707">The District began in service in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.989" offset="15727365">The All-American Canal was finished in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.003" offset="15739382">Now, bear in mind that both of these great projects are not just projects built under Section 5 with water contracts with the Secretary, these are the projects which under Section 4 (b) were required to underwrite Hoover Dam and the all-American canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.081" offset="15799672">These are not paper filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.164" offset="15808031">These are not some sort of exotic contracts not dependent upon the chemistry of offering acceptance and considerations, as the Master says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.103" offset="15843767">The Metropolitan Water District undertook a contract with United States calling for some $80 million in cash for power and some $12 million for payment for storage of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.872" offset="15886817">It built an aqueduct which has cost over $400 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.975" offset="15899251">It serves eight million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.376" offset="15908864">Half of the water supply for the coastal plain of Southern California comes through this aqueduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.609" offset="15929762">If the Master's Report is sustained, this supply in its entirety will be lost whenever the Colorado River Compact's restrictions upon the water supply available to the Lower Basin is enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.065" offset="15983679">This is inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.894" offset="15994964">Here, let me emphasize perhaps what I should have earlier the meaning of the term “consumptive use” the common denominator of the Master, the Master's Report, his decree, our contracts, the Project Act, the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.175" offset="16056090">What is consumptive use?</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.165" offset="16064031">It is not the flow of the river at Lee Ferry or in these tributaries at some designated point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.206" offset="16092244">It is not the quantity diverted by a project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.334" offset="16104678">It is a quantity diverted minus the part of that that returns to the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.189" offset="16128084">Now, that has this very great significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.919" offset="16139055">As the Master says, “75 million acre-feet of water flow in each decade at Lee Ferry”, under Article III (d) the guarantee of the compact, as he calls it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.308" offset="16188583">While it may be regulated by Hoover Dam into an annual discharge from Lake Mead of 7,500,000 acre-feet will not sustain 7,500,000 acre-feet per year of consumptive use below Lake Mead but much less for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.706" offset="16258173">First, because of losses in transit, evaporation losses, channel losses; and second, because of the returns to the river which must be deducted from this quantity even if diverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.256" offset="16316374">And the significant example of that is the Mexican boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.140" offset="16335914">When I was here before, Mr. Justice Douglas asked about the troubles of Mexico arising from the quality of water reaching Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.246" offset="16364335">This is return flow at the Mexican boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.438" offset="16377083">It is salty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.207" offset="16384188">Every irrigation project must keep alive by maintaining salt balance as much salt must flow out of the project as enters it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.744" offset="16414386">This is agricultural sewage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.451" offset="16425148">The quantity of water that finally leaves the United States at the Mexican boundary must be deducted from the 75 million acre-feet received at Lee Ferry even if you had no losses in transit to discover how much consumptive use.</text>

            <text syncTime="6270.945" offset="25187140">I want to summarize it very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6275.820" offset="25206680">First, before I do I've been reminded that I did not fully answer one question here as to what would happen if California, I said a minute ago that if California prevailed on both the priority issue and the limitation issue that I'm going to briefly discuss now, we'd get 4,600,000 acre-feet out of, let's say 6 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="6295.414" offset="25285047">If we prevail only upon the priority issue, that is to say if you sustain our priorities up to the quantitative ceiling of 4,400,000 acre-feet then there being 6 million acre-feet available I'll assume, Arizona and Nevada would have 1,600,000 acre-feet about a half million acre-feet more than they used last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="6316.229" offset="25368325">In other words, there would be that quantity available for any project they want to use it on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6320.400" offset="25384939">If you decide with us on priorities but if you reject the limitation argument that I'm about to make, if you accept both of them then against a supply of 6 million acre-feet we'd get the 4,600,000, I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6334.234" offset="25440319">Now also, it would be fair to say that if there's as much as 7,500,000 acre-feet below Lake Mead which means more than 10 million flowing in at Lee Ferry then happily, we'd get as much as 5,400,000 acre-feet in Arizona and Nevada to get 2,100,000, plenty of water for everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="6354.587" offset="25521716">We'd get our full supply for our projects and they would get 2,100,000, a million more than they're now using in the middle -- Central Arizona project but to get into that happy state, we have to have at Lee Ferry more than 10 million acre-feet and the Upper Basin has to reduce its uses to not over a 3 million or 4 million acre-feet not the 7,500,000 they thought they got under the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.196" offset="25620146">What were the realistic supply here is of the order of 6,000,000 to 6,500,000 acre-feet, weren't nearly six.</text>
