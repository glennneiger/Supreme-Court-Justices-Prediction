            <text syncTime="8.635" offset="137906">Mr. Williams, you may continue your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="12.092" offset="151698">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.294" offset="180537">When the Court recessed on last Thursday, we were discussing the evidentiary consequences of the unlawful arrest of petitioner, Toy.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.402" offset="248978">Specifically, we were discussing the admissibility of the oral statement which he made immediately after his arrest in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.392" offset="304985">That statement, you will recall, was a denial of the fact that he had sold narcotics to one Hom Way, and a further statement to the narcotics officers that he knew were there was some heroin namely in the home of one Johnny, whom we later learned to be a Johnny Yee.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.457" offset="421177">It is our contention if the Court please, that since the arrest of petitioner Toy was unlawful, his detention was unlawful ab initio.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.614" offset="477811">And since his detention was unlawful ab initio, the statement which was offered against him at his trial was a statement made during his unlawful detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.799" offset="526608">This Court, in a line of cases since 1943, has held that statements made by an accused during a period of unlawful detention are inadmissible against him by reason of the fact that they were obtained in violation of a statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.452" offset="609155">It is our contention if the Court please, that a fortiori statements made during a period of illegal detention brought about by a violation of his constitutional rights should be rendered inadmissible by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.468" offset="681253">Now, just as physical, tangible and visible evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment had been held to be inadmissible by the Court so too unequivocally, this Court held last year in the case of Silverman against the United States that verbal, oral evidence is likewise protected within the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.351" offset="784802">And if this evidence has seized in violation of the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, it is likewise excludable.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.182" offset="820120">Now, our research, if the Court please, has found only two cases in all of federal jury's prudence that are apposite to the case at bar, none from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.834" offset="894725">In 1940, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had before in a case on all force with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.953" offset="951150">The decision was written by Judge Vinson for unanimous court including Chief Judge Groner and Judge Edgerton.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.795" offset="990542">The facts were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.604" offset="997752">A taxi cab at 1 o'clock in the morning struck a parked car.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.737" offset="1018337">The taxi cab was abandoned by its driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.956" offset="1031189">The police came on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.313" offset="1036622">They found the registration in the taxi cab, and they went to the home of the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.129" offset="1059924">They made an unlawful entry into his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.413" offset="1072985">They went to the second floor, they found him.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.669" offset="1086046">And he immediately admitted that he had been driving the car which was involved in the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.124" offset="1123871">The question before the Appeals' Court was whether that statement, that oral statement made as the result of an unlawful entry might be admitted against him in his trial for drunk and driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.320" offset="1172668">And the Court of Appeals unanimously held that the protection of the Fourth Amendment and the exclusionary rule, which came into being in 1914 in the Weeks case, rendered that oral statement inadmissible against him and struck down the evidence as having been obtained through the violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.310" offset="1264619">Again, in a case exactly in point with the case at --</text>

            <text syncTime="295.910" offset="1286980">-- before you leave that first case Mr. Williams, as you explain it to us, it strikes me that that case involved these overtones of the Fifth Amendment as well as the Fourth Amendment which makes it, in some ways unlike the case now before us, doesn't it, where here, we're not talking about self-incriminatory statements so much as statements by one person allegedly wrongly arrested which incriminated another person?</text>

            <text syncTime="321.652" offset="1390007">It turned out if the Court please that in this case, of course, that statement made by the petitioner was used as one of the most cogent pieces of incriminatory evidence against Toy because that is the precise statement upon which the Government relies as corroborative of a subsequent alleged confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.991" offset="1471300">So I feel if the Court please that that was, as used by the Government, an incriminatory statement within the purview of the Fifth as well as the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.817" offset="1514663">Because of the use to which it was put by the Government at his trial and the use to which it's put before this Court what it's argued by the Government that it is corroborative, corroborative evidence of a subsequent confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.312" offset="1576626">Now, the case of Somer against the United States is even closer.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.667" offset="1594075">That case was decided in 1943 by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.938" offset="1615078">Judge Learned Hand wrote for unanimous court.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.680" offset="1626049">The facts were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.348" offset="1632737">Agents of the Alcoholic Tax Unit entered the apartment of one Somer in Brooklyn, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.902" offset="1658964">They found there his wife and they found a steel in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.171" offset="1684041">His wife said to the officers who arrested her that her husband would be home in 20 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.692" offset="1722180">And so they went downstairs and stood in front of the building and awaited the return of appellant Somer.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.002" offset="1755408">Somer came along in his car 20 minutes later, and there was whiskey in the backseat.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.096" offset="1775783">He was arrested and the whiskey was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.387" offset="1784874">He went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.101" offset="1791770">A motion was filed to suppress the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.488" offset="1801279">The Trial Judge did in fact suppress the evidence found in the apartment on the ground that it was gained as a result of an unlawful entry and unlawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.451" offset="1837223">But the trial court refused to suppress the evidence found outside in the automobile of -- of appellant Somer.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.562" offset="1869615">When the case went to the Second Circuit, Judge Hand writing for unanimous court found that if the police had gone down to the front of the house and waited for Somer because of the information which they received from Mrs. Somer resulting from their unlawful entry that it could not be admitted against the appellant Somer.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.879" offset="1954879">And it sent the case back to the lower court for determination as to whether that was the sole motivating force which impelled the police to go downstairs and wait for his return.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.156" offset="3068008">Now, the Government, if the Court please, has cited three cases as supporting its position, presumably a counsel has combed the whole field of federal decisions in an effort to bolster his position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.947" offset="3131120">And he cites three cases, Smith against The United States decided in this Circuit in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.560" offset="3149615">I refer to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.862" offset="3158810">That case does not support the Government's position because the Court of Appeals in the Smith case found the arrest to have been lawful, and it distinguished the Smith case from the Nueslein case.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.686" offset="3206144">It specifically said the arrest is lawful in any consolation that the Government may get in this case comes from dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.291" offset="3236551">The case of United States against Walker which came out of the Second Circuit in 1952 is cited by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.738" offset="3266330">Again, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit specifically said that the appellant had failed to prove that the arrest was illegal, and so I say that that case likewise is not apposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.467" offset="3313246">And finally, he cites a case in 1945 which likewise came out of this Circuit called Gibson against the United States.And the Government fails to distinguish between two counts in an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.161" offset="3364028">One of which was struck down and one of which was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.170" offset="3376044">The one which was not struck down, which was affirmed, was supported by virtue of the fact that after the appellant had been unlawfully arrested and, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, after he had been released, he --he then made a statement to the police when he came to headquarters the next day and said, “I have more marijuana in another apartment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="846.435" offset="3489102">And of course since a release had terminated the effect of the illegal detention, the Court of Appeals for this Circuit permitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.348" offset="3520763">Now, we likewise say that the narcotic seized in the apartment of Yee was in admissible as fruit of the poisonous tree within the purview of the Nardone decision and the Silverthorne decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.818" offset="3570604">And finally we say that the confessions which were given on the fifth and ninth of the month, some days after, were inadmissible because the record is absolutely salient with respect to any arraignment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.591" offset="3629746">The only thing that appears about an arraignment is the statement made on page 6 of the Government's brief where the Government says that the petitioners were arraign but there is nothing in the record to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.268" offset="3680423">Now, in that statement appeared in Government's brief, since it was unsupported by the record, we wrote to San Francisco to determine the facts of the arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.003" offset="3719398">The facts of the arraignment time-wise are as represented by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.406" offset="3736952">But the facts of the arraignment show that at the time of the arraignment, warrants of arrest were issued on complaints by the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.647" offset="3785958">I think that that is the demonstrative of the fact that at least in the arresting officers' minds, they did not have valid basis for those arrest without a warrant, which had been consummated many hours before.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.287" offset="3836531">Finally, there is one question which I think is dispositive of the case apart from the evidentiary consequences of the unlawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.687" offset="3866102">And that is, that it has been hornbook law, articulated by this Court many times that a confession cannot support a conviction standing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.046" offset="3907584">It must be corroborated.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.522" offset="3913435">Each element to the offense must be corroborated.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.300" offset="3924616">There is no corroborative evidence in this record with respect to these petitioners because the only evidence apart from the confession is number one, Toy's statement that there were narcotics in the possession of Yee, number two, the narcotics found in Yee's possession and number three, Yee statement that he knew Toy and Sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.937" offset="4007163">But there is no evidence, number one, that either petitioner concealed the narcotic, transported the narcotic, knew that the narcotic was illegally imported or that either petitioner possessed the narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.082" offset="4071737">The statute says that possession alone will support a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.218" offset="4096293">That is true, a conviction against the possessor but not against someone who is not the possessor and he -- who is not related to the possessor in a conspiratorial relationship and these men were acquitted on the count of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.553" offset="4149582">And so I say for that reason, these convictions cannot stand under Smith against The United States which made it a requisite that a confession be corroborated with respect to every element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.526" offset="4193468">Now, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal if I may.</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.850" offset="4754787">They asked the District Court to exclude three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.243" offset="4768371">First, their confessions which were given voluntarily at the police station, four or five days after the arrest and after they had been released on their own recognizance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.264" offset="4816436">There was no bail there when they were released upon arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.989" offset="4831378">Second, they seek to have excluded this ounce of heroin have found not at the premises of Wah Toy but a lot -- quite long distance way in the City of San Francisco sometime later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.861" offset="4882787">There was nothing illegally seized at Wah Toy's premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.745" offset="4898356">And third, they seek to have excluded the directions given by Wah Toy as to where the agents would find this heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.514" offset="4933465">The argument of course is that the arrestment of Wah Toy was unlawful, that the illegality of his arrest by the agents from following that lead to get the narcotics, that the narcotics therefore should be excluded from evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.202" offset="4996159">And even if I understand it correctly, they say that since the defendants confess four days later, those voluntary confessions after arraignment and release should also be excluded under the logical conclusion their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.258" offset="5068361">Now, manifestly the whole house of cards collapses if this, we submit to be the case, the original rest -- arrest was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.875" offset="5106918">In this respect, we think the District Court was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.143" offset="5119979">The facts clearly must be taken as the District Court presumably found them and we think that the court below erred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.321" offset="5696658">This Court was asked to revert it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.129" offset="5703868">Brinegar, I think, had an off head guess involved at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.992" offset="5723303">My first point then as I said, is that the arrest, although without warrant, were lawful because based upon probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.539" offset="5761546">The legal standard for determining the legality of an arrest without warrant is well-settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.296" offset="5788505">The criminal codes specifically give narcotic agents the authority to make arrest without warrant for violations of any law of the United States relating to narcotic drugs, where the person making the arrest has reasonable grounds to believe that the person's to be arrested -- person to be arrested has committed or is committing such violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.906" offset="5882964">The reasonable grounds required by the statute are equivalent, the Court has said to the probable cause required by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.634" offset="5925909">Probable cause is reasonable ground for belief of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.632" offset="5953912">It certainly something less than evidence that would justify a conviction, it's evidence that permits of some mistake on the part of the arresting officer, provided that the mistake was a reasonable one made by a man acting on facts leading sensibly to the conclusions of probability, to quote from this Court's opinion in the Draper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.242" offset="6044296">So the issue here is whether at the time Agent Wong went into the house, he had probable cause to believe that Wah Toy had committed or was committing the crime of concealing unlawfully imparted narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.183" offset="6116080">And I would like to take the Court first through the facts with respect to Wah Toy's arrest and then with the facts with respect to Wong Sun's arrest which I think will show as I've said that the agent had ground for this reasonable belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.573" offset="6177625">Let's take Wah Toy first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.742" offset="6190373">The agent had first information given him by Hom Way would certainly seems to us to have justified questioning Toy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.461" offset="6233213">And while perhaps not probable cause by itself, appointed suspicion and was a fact that the agent would properly keep in his mind as he proceeded with his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.265" offset="6280443">Hom Way, the informer was believed by the agent to be reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.483" offset="6301341">He testified to that both on direct and cross-examination, and he had known him for six weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.456" offset="6333210">There's not the slightest hint contrary to Mr. Williams' suggestion, that there was any protracted interrogation of Hom Way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.179" offset="6368110">We do know there was a period of time between his arrest and the time when he gave the information, but we don't know anything about what happened to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.551" offset="6401546">That Hom Way's statement was hearsay and would not be admissible in evidence, of course does not derogate from the fact that it would be one circumstance supporting probable cause as this Court held in the Draper case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.360" offset="7336835">And there's a further evidence that one of the witnesses knowing back as I say round 1953 or 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.396" offset="7360972">So in the light of those facts, it seems to me, there is no basis for assuming that he didn't understand what the agent meant when he said I'm a narcotics agent and that he didn't understand the badge of course the fact that he then slammed the door and then turned around and run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.902" offset="7422934">It's most persuasive that he understood only too well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.936" offset="7747166">They went at 6:30 in the morning which I submit under the circumstances was not an unreasonable hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.185" offset="8944097">It was daylight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.114" offset="8943992">8 o'clock is a common time for opening businesses in that community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.679" offset="8943888">Indeed, Wah Toy was going to open his day at 8 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.553" offset="8943783">There was some urgency about pursuing this lead there and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.219" offset="8943679">Hom Way had been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.576" offset="8943574">When one close to a narcotics group has been arrested, his -- the word of his disappearance spreads rather rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.148" offset="8943470">Narcotics are very easily disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.111" offset="8943365">If you took too long in pursuing the point, they might be disposed of in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.223" offset="8943261">Now, I don't suggest that Hom Way's information taking a -- taking alone would constitute probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.194" offset="8943156">We do submit that it was certainly a sufficient reason to go to the laundry and to pursue the investigation further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.083" offset="8943052">So the laundry went -- so the investigator went to the laundry, knocked on the door, I emphasize that Alton Wong went to the door alone, there was no (Inaudible) at the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.041" offset="8942947">There was one agent thereby himself and attempted to draw the man who came to the door into conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.348" offset="8942843">When the -- Wah Toy, as it turned out to be, attempted to break off the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.647" offset="8942738">The agent took out his badge, said, “I'm a narcotics agent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.642" offset="8942634">And at that point and only then that Wah Toy slammed the door and run down the hall so that there may be no doubt about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.303" offset="8942529">Let me ask the Court to turn to the relevant passage in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.484" offset="8942425">On page 51, bottom of the page on the right hand side, they brought the witness up to the time where he -- where Wah -- Wah Toy told him to come back and the witness finished there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.750" offset="8942320">“And at that time, he got the door halfway open and I pulled my badge out”, describe what you mean by halfway open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.760" offset="8942216">“He get the door one hand on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.091" offset="8942111">The door is open about -- I would say about 30 degrees open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.831" offset="8942007">And he was talking to me through the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.900" offset="8941902">And he told me to come back at 8 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.351" offset="8941798">I told him I pulled my badge out and told him, "I am a federal narcotics agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.391" offset="8941693">And at that time, he slammed the door and started running.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.476" offset="8941589">In other words, after he pulled his badge out, the agent has pulled his badge out and after he had said, “I am a narcotics agent”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.052" offset="8941484">Running where?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.248" offset="8941380">“Running inside his living quarter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.454" offset="8941275">“Could you see it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.972" offset="8941171">“Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.664" offset="8941066">“What is it, a glass door?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.954" offset="8940962">“Yes, it is glass door.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.915" offset="8940857">“No obstruction, that is correct?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.291" offset="8940753">“No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.407" offset="8940648">So they further declaimed that this wasn't a bursting in, simply on the strength of what Hom Way has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.344" offset="8940544">It was a bursting in after a man who had fled as soon as he was informed that there was police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.996" offset="8940440">And bursting in after a man as to whom the agent already had some information tending to link him with a narcotics violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.613" offset="8940335">At this point, he had the two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.628" offset="8940231">He had the statement of Hom Way that Wah Toy has been dealing in narcotics which was given by a man he believed to be reliable, although conceitedly he had never had information coming before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.739" offset="8940126">But he said he believed him to be reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.089" offset="8940022">And he had the fact that the minute -- although the man was willing to talk to him, open the door when he knocked on it, that the minute he said, “I'm a narcotics agent” and showed his badge then the man turned and ran.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.812" offset="8939917">We're now adding the information from Hom Way -- Hom Way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.445" offset="8939813">And this turning and running together, it seems to me, that there was a clearest ground for the evidence to conclude -- for the agent to conclude that this man is running to destroy his narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.962" offset="8939708">Experience as a narcotics agent would've demonstrated over and over again that when a -- a man -- the narcotics train, is approach of by an agent and learns that he is an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.475" offset="8939604">The first thing he attempts to do is to get rid of the narcotic and to escape perhaps if he can but narcotics can so easily disposed of that this invariably an effort to slap it off in some manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.559" offset="8939499">And certainly, the agent could rationally conclude that this is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.731" offset="8939395">Let me look at it in another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.544" offset="8939290">Why else would the man have run?</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.164" offset="8939186">Look at it from the point of view of the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.850" offset="8939081">It's certainly no reason to suppose -- for him to suppose that the law in agent was a burglar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.848" offset="8950784">The agent himself was of Chinese descent like Wah Toy so I do not think one can present a picture even if he otherwise could to be a stranger in the city confronted with a lot of people who were not likely to be sympathetic to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.834" offset="9014732">The agent had identified himself before Wah Toy ran.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.683" offset="9034062">And so again, there was -- this would destroy the notion of the burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.883" offset="9050885">Mr. Williams says, “Well this was the erratic behavior of a victim of unreasonable intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.892" offset="9074918">But there had been no intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.972" offset="9083277">It's only when you jumble the facts all up together and don't take the situation as it confronted the agent at that time which is the decisive question that you can say that this was the result of the erratic behavior resulting from an unreasonable intrusion because there'd simply been none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.974" offset="9159241">Now, I would concede of course that a citizen has a right to break off a conversation with a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.371" offset="9192887">There was no reason why Wah Toy shouldn't have simply said, “I don't care to talk to you,” have shut the door and gone quietly back to bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.308" offset="9240639">But I submit that one would not -- who is a that frame of mind, who is standing on the sanctity of his health, wouldn't suddenly turn at the moment it was -- he learn this man was a narcotics agent, slam the door and run back to the other part of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.840" offset="9306781">It does -- it doesn't seem to me that would be the normal way to react.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.925" offset="9327052">No I can't think of any other explanations that the agent could have put on this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.559" offset="9357563">There's no suggestion that he -- that Wah Toy had smelled his breakfast burning and runaway for that reason or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.359" offset="9388805">Toy didn't suggest any explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.157" offset="9399986">Toy simply said, “It didn't happen that way.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2508.607" offset="10137788">Now, some of those possibilities could have been minimized by calling the agents half a block away and posting them at the doors of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.340" offset="10176763">But I suppose they would have had no more right to arrest Wah Toy when he came out than the agent had to arrest him then and there when he fled.</text>

            <text syncTime="2554.146" offset="10319914">We stand and all I -- the two combinations of the two bits of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.263" offset="10356381">To this extent Mr. Chief Justice, we do differ very strongly with the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.213" offset="10388250">We think that the attempt to lay down a -- sort of a subordinate rule about probable cause applicable to informers by the court below where it says that if the informer has previously given the information that proved reliable then his tip constitutes probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.148" offset="10471946">But if he hasn't, it isn't probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.344" offset="10484799">We think that is a very grave mistake, and we're much concern about that as a general proposition because we think that the ultimate question is whether there is probably cause that whether a -- information from an informer constitutes probable cause, depends on many things other than just whether he has given the information before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.224" offset="10580302">It depends on who he is, his station in the community, what is known about him or what kind of evidence he gives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.540" offset="10609560">Indeed in the Draper case, if the Court will recall, was given in great detail and it was possible to verify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.307" offset="10644564">So, I do want to say that we are concerned about the Court's declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.916" offset="10663058">We think that it made a basic mistake there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.119" offset="10671835">But in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, come back again to a direct answer to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.963" offset="10691271">No, I do not assert that on the basis of Hom Way's statements alone, the agents would have been justified in making the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.681" offset="10730141">We think more important than that was this flight and flight --</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2662.364" offset="10752815">-- was the flight from the agent the minute the man learned the retreat if that's a more acceptable word but turning and running which is what he did and over and over again in cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.261" offset="10808404">The Court's have held almost without exception that running away from one known to be a -- an officer investigating a crime is itself, the strongest kind of evidence furnishing probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.467" offset="10889279">Now, I don't say that that alone would have constituted reason to breakthrough the door and to make the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.116" offset="10923865">But here, there was the two together and the two together and taking the agent's position, we think certainly gave him reasonable grounds to believe that this man was concealing or had concealed heroin and that's enough for the purposes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.012" offset="10999411">There's one illustration that is very close indeed, I don't want to bother the Court of precedents because this case is on probable cause turn very much on their own fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.167" offset="11040057">But there is a case decided in California where the agents were somewhat more information from an informer than there was here and some other confirmatory evidence went to a house where they thought narcotics were concealed and knocked on the door and when the man came, he discovered they were police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.625" offset="11145906">He slammed the door in their faces and they could hear his steps running into the inside of the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.349" offset="11172760">The California courts held that there was probable cause to go in under those circumstances and they did see is the narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.280" offset="11208495">Under such circumstances, the Court said the act of the man in slamming and locking the door indicated that the man was fleeing from and attempting to prevent the officer from apprehending him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.603" offset="11253739">The information which the officer had received and the conduct of the appellant in the presence of the officer constituted probable cause to arrest appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.743" offset="11294386">We think the basic mistake of the court below was in taking these two things each separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.964" offset="11327195">It may well have been true that the information given by Hom Way alone did not constitute probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.980" offset="11355303">It might well have been that if this had happened with the officer who had gone up to the door with no reason to go there and other lack of information and the man turned and fled that that alone wouldn't constitute probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.276" offset="11412459">But I submit that anyone in the position of this officer when he had the two bits of information, who has had -- who had to face the question, “What do I do now?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.676" offset="11462092">would have answered by saying, “It is my duty to arrest this man.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.435" offset="11477138">So he went in and followed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.386" offset="11484871">Now, if -- if he did have probable cause in that stage then of course the arrest is lawful and the whole of the petitioner's case collapses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.625" offset="11525831">There is one other point which I should -- with which I should deal before leaving this matter of probable cause to arrest Wah Toy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.420" offset="11569089">The agent pushed through and broke the lock on the door, broke the door right around the lock one or the other, immediately that he heard Wah Toy -- saw Wah Toy attempt to slam the door and saw through the glass door, he couldn't miss any of this, Wah Toy running down the hallway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.746" offset="11654353">The agent did not stop and say again, “We are police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.268" offset="11680475">I have come to arrest you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.336" offset="11688730">I asked admission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.633" offset="11697925">In other words, the argument is made to the Court that there was a failure to conform with the various statutory rule laid down in Miller against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.241" offset="11736377">But note that this was not a case of coming and breaking into the door or climbing into the window without any previous announcement to the occupant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.954" offset="11771173">Indeed, there was an announcement and it was the announcement that led the occupant to try to slam the door and run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.595" offset="11797713">The Court in the Miller case or this case we submit comes within the well-recognized exception that announcement is unnecessary where the officer has reason to believe that it's useless or that it will result in the destruction of evidence or the destruction of contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.956" offset="11879215">In the Miller case itself acknowledged that there were state decisions holding the justification for noncompliance exist in exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.256" offset="11916413">As for example, when the officers may say in -- may in good faith believe that the person arrested is fleeing or attempting to destroy evidence, plainly, this is such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.694" offset="11962180">The same rule has been recognized by the California courts, and the same rule has been announced by the American Law Institute in the restatement of torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.165" offset="12004080">So that I think there is really nothing here to the point that some further announcement was necessary to make this arrest proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.024" offset="12043473">I turn now, although Mr. Williams do not stress it in argument, to the point that he argues in his brief to it that there was no probable cause for the arrest of Wong Sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.613" offset="12101778">In this instance, it seems to us that there's really no merit to the argument at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.901" offset="12130931">When the officers went to arrest Wong Sun, they had the statement of Johnny Yee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.821" offset="12158621">Johnny Yee, you'll remember is the man to whom Wah Toy had appointment, and said he has the narcotic, he's the man who sells narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.607" offset="12205850">And it was in Johnny Yee's house that the agents found something less than the ounce of heroines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.518" offset="12237406">Johnny Yee said that he got the heroin from "Sea Dog.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.484" offset="12261334">And -- but he couldn't say who "Sea Dog" was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.462" offset="12277217">He just knew him as a man named "Sea Dog.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.520" offset="12289442">Here is one item that the agents had when they went to arrest Wong Sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.990" offset="12311280">And this statement by Johnny Yee was certainly supported by the fact that Johnny Yee did have narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.750" offset="12342418">They no longer just a tip, it was a tip by somebody who had the narcotics which gave some support to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.927" offset="12371048">Furthermore, this information fitted in with Toy's assertion that Yee had the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.832" offset="12410650">And it was corroborated that Toy's statement was corroborated by his close description of the inside of Johnny Yee's house and of the habits of Johnny Yee's friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.958" offset="12459238">In addition, the agents, before they went to arrest Wong Sun, had Toy's identification of “Sea Dog.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.571" offset="12493615">They'd identified him, they told where his house was and indeed he took him to the house and pointed it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.319" offset="12524648">So that this -- this corroborated but Yee had said still further, “You had two men giving information”, according to Wong Sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.169" offset="12564041">I think the agents were also entitled to take into the account although it was fairly remote that Hom Way's original story had put them on this trail although it did not work out exactly as Hom Way has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.840" offset="12618689">And finally, the record does contain that some indications that the agents knew “Sea Dog” have awe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.696" offset="12654111">One of the agents when they we -- went to make the arrest and greeted Sea Dog's wife by her first name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.409" offset="12680965">She apparently knew him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.292" offset="12688488">And we know that “Sea Dog” had had a prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.743" offset="12706356">So that again while this is slate and I think the information from Yee and Toy are the crucial thing, this still more gave reasonable grounds for believes that Wong Sun was guilty of concealing narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.285" offset="12768528">Now in his case, there's no argument directly that the manner of making the arrest of the agents' testimony meant as it is plain that they were admitted by his wife and sister and that the wife said that he was in a certain room that they then went in and arrest him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.880" offset="12834879">So I submitted in conclusion upon this point that as in the case of Wah Toy, there was probable cause for the arrest of Wong Sun and that the case the petitioner made for the exclusion of the evidence, the foundation is called out from under and that the Court should affirm the judgment below without ever reaching the question of whether the exclusionary rules would keep this out -- evidence out if the arrest were unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.601" offset="12973746">I would like now to go on and consider that point since it was in the opinion below and the ground on which that court rested and has been briefed and argued here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.435" offset="13025155">We submit that even if the entry into Wah Toy's house and his arrest were unlawful, nevertheless, the narcotics found in another house pursuant to Toy's direct and the confessions made five days later when these men weren't even in custodies were properly admitted in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.800" offset="13110523">And we make the same contention with respect to the statement by Wah Toy at the time of his arrest that narcotics would be found in Johnny Yee's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.918" offset="13159006">Now of course, I concede that there is a well-established general rule that excludes from admission in evidence after an unlawful search and seizure all physical evidence, seized as the result of the unlawful search, all observations made by the police while unlawfully in the premises, any conversation overheard by the police while unlawfully in the building and in addition, any other evidence which is the direct product of the Government's unlawful action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.124" offset="13315845">Plainly, the first three categories that we can set aside as irrelevant here, there was nothing tangible seized at Wah Toy's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.911" offset="13359000">And there's no claim that there was an unlawful search or indeed any search at Johnny Yee's house because he voluntarily handed over the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.842" offset="13402781">There was nothing observed at Wah Toy's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.088" offset="13415737">There are no conversations overheard as in the Spyke case which were improperly obtained by the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.790" offset="13454503">The confessions of the heroin was taken from Yee's, the confessions as I say came five days later and the statement, “You can go to Yee's to get the narcotics,” we contend was voluntarily given and related only by coincidence in time to the assumed to be unlawful arrest and that no sense a product of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.259" offset="13724400">Yes, it took place in -- I would state accurately, the statement was made while they were there unlawfully on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.136" offset="13763897">There was certainly a coincidence in point of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.198" offset="13780198">And I suppose that one would not have occurred but for the other thing -- but for an action would certainly satisfy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.392" offset="13820949">The fruit of the poison tree doctrine, we submit, does not bar from evidence everything that comes into the possession of the Government that is found in the sense that Justice Frankfurter was just using the word after an unlawful search seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.469" offset="13905272">The original case Silverthorne was of course one where the connection was very mediate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.842" offset="13926693">The Government was seeking to put in an evidence Photostats of materials, they never would have known existed but for the unlawful entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.118" offset="13963891">In Nardone, the Court held that it was error to prevent inquiry into whether the Government's other evidence had been achieved as a result of the original unlawful wiretapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.481" offset="14025331">The case was reversed for the purposes of making that affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.853" offset="14042781">Even in Nardone, the Court said that as a matter of good sense, however, such connection may become so attenuated as to dissipate the tape -- tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.925" offset="14091055">What we have I suggest, is a question of proximity and degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.818" offset="14114670">The aim here is certainly to eliminate the incentive for misconduct by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.756" offset="14138389">It's to avoid stultifying and debasing the Court by convicting man of crime on the basis of evidence obtained through crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.295" offset="14176528">On the other hand, it is also been -- has also been the effort of the Court, it's clear in this on several occasion, to avoid the mistake of immunizing those who may be guilty of simply because of the misconduct of the Government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.951" offset="14243192">There's a balance to be struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.902" offset="14251029">And I would say that the way to strike it was in terms of appraising the relationship between the misconduct and the evidence sought to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.054" offset="14287600">Now, I'd like next to illustrate to the Court -- put to the Court a number of illustrations in support of those general observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.545" offset="14321560">I do not contend that they're on all force with this case but I will come closer to this case as I go through in the sense the preposition is illustrated by the fact that a man who has been the victim of an unlawful search and seizure may nevertheless be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.286" offset="14404524">I suppose that his plea of guilty may in some remote sense be stimulated by the fact that the agents walked in on him when he was in possession of the -- of the contraband or the instruments of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.492" offset="14473383">Nevertheless, the mere fact that such a guilty plea follows after an unlawful search that does not make it legally irrelevant and of course the conviction based on such a plea withstand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.350" offset="14524792">There's an interesting case here in the District Circuit which illustrates the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.243" offset="14552377">In (Inaudible) against the United States as the name of the case, in this case the man was unlawfully detained at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.443" offset="14585187">During the period of unlawful detention, one of the victims of the crime came in and identified him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.005" offset="14615385">And later, the victim testified at the trial that this was the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.962" offset="14639208">He argued that since he'd brought to the victim's -- brought to the witnesses' attention during the unlawful detention that this testimony should not be admitted but the Court held that it was admissible and deferring conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.170" offset="14708067">Again in the Bynum case, a man was fingerprinted during an unlawful detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.185" offset="14732100">It was held that those fingerprints could not be used as evidence to compare with the fingerprints left at the scene of the crime, and the original conviction was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.622" offset="14777866">But when the case came back based upon evidence of the man's fingerprints taken from the FBI files compared with those at the scene of the crime, the court, the same court held that conviction was proper even though in the sense the original fingerprint and original comparison had led to the idea that they should get out Bynum's prints from a standing FBI file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.057" offset="14899597">Perhaps a closer case in point is United States against Bayer where the Court will remember that it was held with only one justice dissenting that a second confession given by a man who had already confessed during a period of unlawful detention was nevertheless admissible in evidence if it was indeed voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.359" offset="14988831">And the Court recognized that the original confession undoubtedly played some part in the later decision to confess but said that this is too remote from the wrong by the police and permitted the conviction to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.987" offset="15063333">Finally, there are a very considerable number of cases holding that confessions given after an unlawful arrest are admissible in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.800" offset="15122578">This is -- I don't mean confessions, during an unlawful detention, I -- I'm not saying anything inconsistent with the McNabb case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.284" offset="15148492">I'm speaking simply of a confession made immediately after an arrest without probable cause or a confession made sometime later where the original arrest is challenged but there has been no unlawful detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.981" offset="15203244">In those cases, the Second, Fifth, Ninth, Tenth and District of Columbia Circuits have all held the confession to be admissible in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.646" offset="15249951">And there a fair number of state court cases even in states that had followed the exclusionary rule of Silverthorne which have held that such confessions are admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.471" offset="15297285">Now, let me apply that latter rule to some of the evidence that petitioner seeks to have excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.579" offset="15329677">The confessions here were made four days after the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.896" offset="15358934">By that time, the man had been arraigned that originally bail had been set and then on the motion of the United States, they had been released on their own recognizance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.184" offset="15420061">They weren't even in custody at the time they made the confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="4152.600" offset="16713749">And so far as I know, there has never been a decision in this Court or indeed any other court except to possibly the Nueslein case in which the mere fact that (Inaudible) was unlawfully arrested was held to be grounds for excluding a voluntary confession, such scattered law as there is dealing with confessions made during improper searches and seizures are moved from the unlawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.318" offset="16836629">The search and seizure such laws there is, is entirely in our favor with the possible exception of the Nueslein case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.537" offset="16873514">Now, I want to suggest this very important distinction to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.160" offset="16900054">I think cases that I referred to and we've cited in our brief are consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.752" offset="16922415">There are certainly some statements made during an unlawful search or seizure which I properly excluded from evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.232" offset="16968286">The best illustration perhaps, the clearest illustration is the case in Mississippi, Harris against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.746" offset="16998379">In the first case, Quan against the State which we refer to, the Court had held although they had the exclusionary rule like the federal rule that a confession or a statement, an admission made during an unlawful search was admissible in evidence if it was truly voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.465" offset="17085210">It said there was no necessary or essential connection between an illegal search and statements freely and voluntarily made to the officers, and it went on to like in the making of such statement to a consent to a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.992" offset="17147382">Now, this later case came up in which the police had unlawfully seize a man's suitcase.And then they ask the man, what's in it?</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.035" offset="17191476">And the man said whiskey.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.523" offset="17197432">It's within a dry area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.712" offset="17206209">And the Court held that the admission as to what was in the suitcase that the police were obviously going to open and look at was -- that that was as inadmissible in evidence as if they had opened the suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.425" offset="17265037">And I choose the Mississippi cases because it contrast the Harris case with the earlier case found against the State which makes the point that I'm trying to make and that is that the question is whether the admission or confession just happens to be coincident with the search in point of time but it's really the product of a voluntary exercising will on the part of the defendant or whether it is in some way the result of the pressure put on him by the unlawful search.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.421" offset="17393037">Now, in the suitcase case is obviously it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.765" offset="17410382">The Nueslein case comes close to ours but I think it's rather distinguishable on that same ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.509" offset="17445386">The officers in Nueslein went in to the taxi driver's house either opening the door or the door was opened, I don't know which it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.025" offset="17487496">There was no one there, somehow rose people upstairs, and the taxi driver was upstairs in the bathroom, and he came down the stairs 10 or 15 minutes later.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.300" offset="17548622">And in that stage, he made admissions about driving the car it was evidently and visibly intoxicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.870" offset="17574849">Now, there are two factors I think which go to suggest that he -- this was not a free and voluntary statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.261" offset="17608391">One was that he's been drinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.907" offset="17614973">It was a statement obtained from him while he was under the influence of intoxicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.079" offset="17639737">Another was it seems to me that the case is one where he was under considerable pressure to explain his condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.657" offset="17665964">For example, as the case cited by the petitioners in Delaware case and Brinegar against the State in which the officers had unlawfully arrested a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.792" offset="17710582">He was later tried for some offense where there had to be proofs that he'd been drinking whether it was a driving under the influence of liquor or manslaughter or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.995" offset="17751333">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.073" offset="17755617">And the agents testified about his conduct during the period of the unlawful arrest and detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.961" offset="17783202">There wasn't any admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.101" offset="17791770">I think Nueslein that comes very close to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.787" offset="17806503">The only additional fact is that he did attempt to give us some explanations about himself, but it seems to me, there were pressures to try and explain a way what the officer had unlawfully obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.148" offset="17863973">Now, here in our case --</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="4483.867" offset="18038888">I should think that the police officers to walk in to his house was an illegality.</text>

          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4492.991" stopTime="4508.422">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="4492.991" offset="18075355">The point of my question is that to me there's a great difference between conceded unquestioned illegality and conduct which requires this Court to decide whether it was or was not probable cause, suppose to me a very different situation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="4508.422" stopTime="4790.834">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="4508.422" offset="18137109">And that I -- I quite agree because one of the -- it's a question whether the agents have gone in for the purpose of getting unlawful evidence or whether they have been called on to make the judgment often in closed questions and then to attribute this interim consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.876" offset="18230836">They really don't serve the purpose at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.792" offset="18250585">The -- well, to -- to try and pull -- try and pull this together, our position with respect to these oral statements is first that the confession, as I think I've shown, were frightfully remote both in terms of intervening events, in terms of the time and in terms of the exercise of freewill -- of a exercising freewill by the man who confessed from any even arguably unlawful entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.083" offset="18403662">The statement made by Wah Toy, I would point out, was not even a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.905" offset="18435009">It certainly wasn't an effort to explain away something the agents had found.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.169" offset="18456012">There was no pressure of that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.916" offset="18467088">It was an effort perhaps to divert suspicion from himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.208" offset="18484224">He said, “No, I've never done anything wrong but go over Johnny Yee house.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.788" offset="18506480">So that it's quite different from the case in which -- or the arrest has caused the search, has uncovered something which the owner of the house feels impelled to try to explain a way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.725" offset="18570324">It's rather like a -- other case in the District of Columbia where a man was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.657" offset="18594043">It was alleged that there was not probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.651" offset="18605955">As soon as he was arrested, he produced a small quantity of narcotics and turned it over to the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.764" offset="18638451">Later, they searched him and found a large quantity of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.806" offset="18662588">And the Circuit Court here held that the small quantity was admissible in evidence whereas if he turned over the whole thing because he says, “There was no use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.716" offset="18698219">You're rampaging through my clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.004" offset="18707414">I'll give it to you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.183" offset="18712116">Of course, it wouldn't have been admissible in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.255" offset="18720371">And I think the significant difference is that the way he did it showed that this was a calculated act which he had -- had chose to do or not to do and not of the result of something forced upon him by the illegal conduct of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.408" offset="18789021">And so here, Yee's statements, that was the kind of statement, it was in the clearance so far as anything in his housewife, was the kind of calculated effort to get the police to go somewhere else and think well of him which cannot be regarded as the product of any overpowering influence by the presence of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.535" offset="18885465">Now, the remaining question in the case is whether the confessions were sufficiently corroborated by other efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.782" offset="18922454">We've dealt with this in detail in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.502" offset="18945337">The chief corroboration here just to devote a sentence or two to it is of course the finding of the narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.373" offset="18984835">There they were and you will note if you examine it with the care that the exact quantity of narcotics found tallies very closely with the confession saying that we took one piece, one ounce of heroin to Johnny Yee's.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.036" offset="19051499">And then later, we smoked some of it because the amount that was gone was a small amount, just about equivalent to what they might have smoked on the two nights in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.827" offset="19094653">Again, the interplay of the knowledge of each of these two men and so far as Johnny Yee testified his knowledge in the others tends to show that the confessions were trustworthy that they were not the product of a disordered mind or one pressured into erratic behavior by the fact that he was arrested and charged with crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.428" offset="19213040">We submit, therefore, Your Honor that the judgment below should be affirmed but on the first ground I argued with the second left I think more wisely, although we believe we're right to some future occasion.</text>
