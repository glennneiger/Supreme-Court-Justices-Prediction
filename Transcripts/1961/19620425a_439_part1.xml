            <text syncTime="7.822" offset="137738">Mr. Ball, you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_s_ball" startTime="10.307" stopTime="493.407">
            <label>Mr. Stuart S. Ball</label>
            <text syncTime="10.307" offset="147665">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.137" offset="158950">To sum up what I've covered yesterday, the issues in this case were not those raised by the 1953 evidence, but by the new prima facie case that was presented in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.511" offset="232511">Second, this prima facie case required Borden to do two things, first, cost justify the general discount schedule volume class against volume class; and second costs justify the special discounts to A&amp;P and to Jewel against those granted the eight independent stores listed by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.987" offset="322372">Now, these issues were never broadened.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.753" offset="337418">The counsel for the Government in the trial below, for example attack this shows at record 93-94, attacked the Borden cost study because it was made and I quote, “After the particular costumers had been -- who have been discriminated against, have been singled out by the Government”.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.617" offset="432922">It was these eight particular stores that were shown to be in commerce and in competition with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.807" offset="461657">And this is exactly the prima facie case that Judge Camel described at record page 563 were he summarizes the evidence as follows, that the sales made by the defendants were in commerce, that the defendants discriminated in price, that the costumers or defendants were in competition with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.432" offset="552145">In reference, it was only made to the showing with respect to the eight independent stores and the five stores of A&amp;P and Jewel and that there may be an injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.241" offset="603449">He also found that the published discount quotations on their fees showed discrimination, and that is between the volume class against volume class.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.775" offset="645559">Now, Borden having the 13 stores, selected by the Government before it, then made its cost study in defense, because the discounts to A&amp;P and the Jewel were based on total sales to all of those stores in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.066" offset="714731">And because we have to justify the volume classes -- volume class against volume class on the published discount schedule, it was necessary to make it an inclusive study.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.438" offset="760184">This was done in this way, time study man were placed for one week on each of the trucks on each of the 134 wholesale routes operated in the Chicago area, where that I mean the routes that serviced primarily grocery stores although they have discovered small restaurant and some other costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.255" offset="859449">Now, the time spent by the drivers on the routes and at each store or other location were recorded as to more than 40 kinds of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.807" offset="909709">At the end of our brief, there is a copy, you will find, of sheets that are photos stand -- these are the actual sheets that cover the time study records made with respect to the deliveries to the Shubert store.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.560" offset="992674">Now there were over in 1900 locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.429" offset="1008138">There were four sheets of -- of which this is the set of four for this one location.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.634" offset="1033007">Four sheets covering the week's deliveries to not more than 1900 locations and the covering sheet, covering each of the 134 routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.090" offset="1078774">These sheets with all of these materials became bulk exhibit number four, that was over 8000 sheets of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.669" offset="1125167">Similar studies were made with respect to the special deliveries that were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.702" offset="1153275">Those are recorded; they became other bulk exhibit number six of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.620" offset="1176889">Bulk exhibit number five was the tickets made for each delivery which again was a very bulky exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.341" offset="1207818">All of these and then cost studies, time studies were also made of clerical activities in the branches and in four different departments in the central office.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.174" offset="1263094">All of these -- these documents were then assembled together in bulk exhibits and bulk exhibits four though 13 were identified and became part of the record, they are massive in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.847" offset="1325787">Now, in addition to gathering of this detailed material, a stipulation was drawn out and submitted in draft form to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.807" offset="1365703">This made certain information out of the accounting records of the company available.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.906" offset="1394019">It made certain error for medical -- basic error for medical calculations and tabulations from the basic data.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.046" offset="1422649">And it also contained extensive information about the operations of the various Borden trucks and of the way in which the Borden Company conducted its business, and various information about the ways in which various of the costumers conducted their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.955" offset="1506241">On the 1950, costumers surveyed in this way, there were 254 stores of A&amp;P and Jewel.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.093" offset="1546783">There were 1322 independent grocery stores, 374 non-store costumers and the analysis was complete so that with the information in the stipulated sheets in the stipulation with the basic data in this bulk exhibits, a cost analysis could be made costumer by costumer, including the non-store costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.014" offset="1642496">In other words, costumer by costumer for 1950 costumers and all of these -- all of these basic data is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.166" offset="1683143">Now, the -- as I've said, you can find out from this basic data the direct cost of sales and delivery to each costumer on the costumer by costumer basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.010" offset="1746463">You have in the descriptions of the operations the rational basis by which measures can be fixed and selected by which indirect cost can be divided in accordance with sound accounting principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.983" offset="1798395">You can also tabulate from that the total cost of sale and delivery to entire groups of costumers such as those within the four discount brackets in the published discount schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.569" offset="1848759">And you also have available in this massive material in the record, the facts showing whether any group was properly classified together, whether they have dissimilar characteristics in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.500" offset="1904452">Now, all of this data was in the record and made available to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.879" offset="1922006">The document was treated as if it were the direct testimony of Mr. Malone under whose supervision the study was made, and it was verified by Haskins and Sells.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.199" offset="1967250">Mr. Malone was then offered to the Government for cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.194" offset="1987208">All of the materials that they asked from Malone both factual and questions about details of operation were then added and added paragraphs to the stipulation which are identified in the record with the letter MD meaning Malone Deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.104" offset="2054813">But the deposition dropped up because all of the material that the Government's request was included in the stipulated material.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="493.407" offset="2080099">Where is that in the record?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_s_ball" startTime="495.197" stopTime="627.659">
            <label>Mr. Stuart S. Ball</label>
            <text syncTime="495.197" offset="2087205">The stipulation here begins at page 119 of the record and runs to 226 covering all of this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.215" offset="2139345">That was then finally embodied and signed by the Court on September 19th, 1957 as a pre-trial order, and that is the one that identified the bulk exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.197" offset="2203188">Now, I want to stress the fact that all of this data was available, because so much of the Government's criticism is based on theoretical instances, hypothetical costumers, not on actual costumers and they make assumptions about hypothetical questions that are contrary to the facts that are shown with respect to the actual costumers in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.084" offset="2294826">Now, in presenting this case to the District Court, the material was summarized in the form of four summary schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.359" offset="2343832">You have two kinds of costs those that are very direct and assignable on time or other direct basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.074" offset="2374760">You also have in accounting what you may call direct or joint costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.369" offset="2395972">And the problem there is to allocate by selecting a proper measure of allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.315" offset="2423662">And incidentally, the best statement of all the principles applicable is in this cost justification study which is in this record which was prepared by a committee appointed by the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.382" offset="2471936">The chairman of which and two members were the three experts that the Government used in the case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.404" offset="2500044">And those experts were on -- by the statement of the deposition of Mr. Willy are shown to have been picked by the Government after a counsel and Mr. Willy their economist went to the Federal Trade Commission and these were pointed out as the best witnesses they could have.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.855" offset="2573814">I think that gives some validity to the cost justification study and points that in following that, we followed the best authority for one due that we could possibly have.</text>

            <text syncTime="682.130" offset="2834934">And there is no general principle involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="706.089" offset="2930751">And so I've pointed out the record shows that at the eight stores select -- the eight independent stores selected by the Government, the three largest independent stores got more than the schedule.</text>

            <text syncTime="724.516" offset="3004520">The record is completely silent because the Government never asked how many other stores -- independent stores receive special discounts, or what the amount was.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.769" offset="3041510">The record is completely silent as to whether they were or were not independent stores had gathered much as the A&amp;P and Jewel store.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.558" offset="5660651">Now, those are the -- because in that there were no economies and mass buying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.121" offset="5678937">Here you have 254 stores which the contacts in selling were altogether at the joint buying level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.574" offset="5716762">Little executive time even if you charged it all, it was be de minimis, we've got the exact figure stated in out brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.202" offset="5743303">However, in order to solicit the 1800 and some independent stores, we have a force of about 30 what we call salesmen and solicitors who were pounding the streets, whose time was devoted to the independents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.425" offset="5808191">Now, the record shows and I'm going to cover this now because this was a point that was raised in allocation yesterday and I want to explain how you find this cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.102" offset="5842881">It is obvious that for the week, the $2000 that was spent in salesman and solicitor's time, none of it could be charged against these chain stores all had to go against the independents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.187" offset="5887185">Now, it would have been possible to have made a time study of saying what stores those men spent their time in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.906" offset="5914039">But unlike deliveries where weeks are repetitious and the week can be a proper sample, you would've had to take a month to two or three months of time studies of those salesmen to balance out and find where they spent their time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.840" offset="5961791">Now, these men were not only salesmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.168" offset="5971090">The sales work, and it's all described in the stipulation covered a number of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.994" offset="5994392">They covered what we called maintaining the accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.095" offset="6006826">They went into the stores, they listened to the stores complaints, they checked on the kind of service that was being given, they put the in store promotions in the right place, they delivered the point of sale material and so that was mounted, they made helpful suggestions to the sales of the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.351" offset="6079864">Now, we have that 2000 is a cost that we bore with respect to independents and not with respect to chains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.153" offset="6119048">It would have been possible to solicit by sending the president of the division around to visit the 1800 independent stores and there would've been no point in having these salesmen calls on the managers of the A&amp;P and Jewel stores who had no right to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.856" offset="6185817">So there have to a difference in dealing right at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.540" offset="6204625">Now, this 2000 a week, Mr. Solomon's last point yesterday was that he had found out that we have allocated that he thought improperly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.543" offset="6668664">Now, there -- I was not -- I do not have the details of those studies, whether in that material there would have been enough to study them store-by-store, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.948" offset="6714222">But the point that had brought it is that the general characteristics of different types of stores have been studied and the cost difference is made before the discount schedule was given.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.502" offset="6828429">To a certain extent, they had a pre-justification study.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.258" offset="6863433">Discount schedules in these situations changed from year to year, sometimes from month to month in a community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.637" offset="6893004">It would -- when it's figured that this study cost is over 50,000 to mean, it is obvious impossible that every time you shift it made different discount arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.594" offset="6932814">And every time you shift to new schedule, you're not going to spend 50,000 in a community and make a cost study to find out just what that discount schedules will be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.238" offset="7767374">This was a split stops that means if this store like most independents had two dairies in it, which meant that there was a problem of display -- relative display of two milks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.515" offset="7824530">In the Chicago area, there were no split stops among the chain stores that we certain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.510" offset="7892449">This store was served six days this is also shown in this -- and it also shows that there were 11 stops which meant that the truck have to come almost twice a day to the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.691" offset="7941245">The average stops for each A&amp;P and Jewel store, the average was only nine and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.881" offset="7966009">This required more stops of the regular truck to service this store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.996" offset="7982414">Schubert required more stops of the regular truck per week than the average of the 80 largest independents which involve a lot of intangible as well as tangible cost, all of these being known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.435" offset="8032152">Also, you will notice on the first sheet under item 63 that on five different days, they have to call for special deliveries of milk in addition to these 11 irregular calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.251" offset="8087427">The record at 194 shows that, all of the 254 chain store locations and the aggregate required only 99 special deliveries that the 80 largest independents only required 27 and this store took five.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.064" offset="8158689">Now again, you conceive the services, this was a large split stop having two kinds of dairies in there, the frequency of delivery and all of these factors came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.406" offset="8212083">There -- you would see that that effect is not only the direct labor cost of the time area but the indirect burden of the special delivery trucks which are expensive to operate and the trucks going back.</text>

            <text syncTime="2216.229" offset="8971410">And this is the answer I think to the basic inquiry, it stands to reason Borden have no policy against giving special discounts to independent stores and no limit as to the amount that they would give.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.089" offset="9426777">The cost justification study points out that you do not even on matters on your subject to exact measurement, have to do that if the cost is great if there are other measures that are equally accurate by which you can divide the time up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.168" offset="9487067">In our various accounts, the salesman time was allocated between independent stores for the salesman's cost on the basis in proportion to their volume purchased on the ground that the salesman would be in the store like Schubert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.814" offset="9549657">With a split stop with the problem of getting Borden milk in a maximum display, he would probably be there in that store far more often than he would in the average store and in really direct proportion or more to the amount of volume.</text>

            <text syncTime="2399.947" offset="9706183">I wanted to say on that point that as far as Schubert is concerned, if you will turn to page 60 -- 63 of our brief, you will find a study of the Schubert costs in which we take the direct labor on the route man, the direct labor on special delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.009" offset="9810463">And then we have allocated the indirect -- direct labor accountant for about two thirds of the cost of the route man's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.364" offset="9847871">We have lift the other third follow which is on accounting method approved in -- by the Government's own experts under many circumstances of letting indirect cost follow direct cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.667" offset="9901160">In this case, we have let wholesale truck cost special delivery indirect in route man's indirect labor follow the direct cost in proportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.382" offset="9939926">If you look at line 10, you will find that either was Schubert, the largest independent and may I say there were not unique independent because, counsel said there were five others beside Schubert and had as much volume as the average A&amp;P store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.080" offset="10006800">The answer is there is only one other store, not identified because not part of the eight, that have a volume as much as the average to the A&amp;P and Jewel stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.835" offset="10049745">That -- and that were -- Schubert was third lower in volume than the next largest store and on the selected eight, he was three times as large as the next largest store in the selected eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.753" offset="10105438">Now, if you look at line 10, you will notice a cost of $7.21 just on delivery cost alone on this allocation to the A&amp;P and Jewel and $11.20 to Schubert which means 3.99 or 399 100s of a percent of discount difference that could've been justified on direct cost alone forgetting the solicitor's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.520" offset="10216511">When you look at these others, down below including salesman solicitor's time, you'll find a cost justification an excess of a 5% difference between this largest of the independents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.751" offset="10269487">Now, I think it's the very inferential that the cost to stores, the others on the selected list, the nearest of which was only one third of the volume of Schubert were fully cost justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.031" offset="10314522">I want to submit again, there is not a scintilla of evidence in the record that Borden have a policy of favoring chain stores and we are looking solely at the economies of volume and the economies of inherent method of which we've describe in some detail and given the figures on the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.046" offset="10382649">In the second place, the argument of classification if you have to define as counsel wants you to do classes on them that you have to show as to each member of the class get a subject to exactly the same cost factors to justify the entire cost difference between classes, that means you've got to have a cost study by costumer-by-costumer study which defeats the purposes of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.917" offset="10478153">But, if you are required to have that under the act, in this case, the Borden cost study mean such a costumer-by-costumer justification, it was up to the Government with this information before it if they were going to take these hard examples instead of dealing with hypothetical cases as they have on their brief to demonstrate that there were independents being unfairly treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.951" offset="10570209">They made no such demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.012" offset="10578463">By giving you Schubert we have shown I think that that demonstration was impossible for them to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.377" offset="10599988">There wasn't any way that Schubert could change his method of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.180" offset="10615139">Now under all of those circumstances, the issues in this case are not a broad issue of law as the Government would like to have you believe, it is that whether the discriminations covered by the Government's prima facie case were as a matter of fact justified by a cost study that was as exhaustive and detailed as any that have been submitted and a cost study that was in accordance with the principles that have been recognized by the decisions of the Federal Trade Commission and of the experts called by the Government.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="2745.345" offset="11087851">I gather from Mr. Ball that my main task here is not show that we have correctly stated our theory as to why the decision below was wrong, but to show that the decision below properly reflected their cost study, because he hasn't really attempted to defend the decision below which I think fairly reflects what Borden put up to the court below as their cost justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.703" offset="11205298">If you gentlemen will read the Borden cost justification which is fully set out in their brief and in the record, and if you will read their trial brief which is mostly set out in the record, you won't find any of this discussion that we had here this morning because what Borden attempted to do below and what the court below said was correct was to cost justify by these averaging techniques of all independents in one class as against the chains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.953" offset="11330267">Now, it suggested here that really all we were attempting to show was wrong were eight stores at all they were attempting to cost justify were eight stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.157" offset="11379064">And Your Honor Justice Harlan said that was a kind of a bill of particulars and that was what we were limiting ourselves to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.865" offset="11401947">But with all due respect, I think that's nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.423" offset="11416158">Under the Morton Salt case of this Court, that's 334 U.S., this type of cost discrimination is almost per se a violation at one of defenses can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.278" offset="11471538">In the Morton Salt case, this Court said the Federal Trade Commission was going away outside what it had to do when it tried to prove and reprove and reprove what is pretty much an obvious fact and when you have a group of retail stores in the city like Chicago competing with one another and some get one price and another get another price, this may tend to substantially lessen competition because after all Clayton Act is a “may” act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.295" offset="11579580">But in order to nail this down because we suspected that there would be some objections that they weren't really in competition, objection was made by Bowman not Borden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.545" offset="11620645">We, in each case, took a sampling and we use this sampling in course approving our prima facie case to prove what we thought was obvious in the first place but to nail it down to show that where you have independent stores and chain stores within a compact area of a mile or so, some of those customers who go into A&amp;P store shop and go into independent stores sometime and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.169" offset="11735165">And that's all these eight or nine exhibits were used for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.275" offset="11751570">They were used as what I can think what's probably an unnecessary nailing down of a prima facie case and this was recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.567" offset="11784694">Judge Campbell, when you read his opinion does not say we made a prima facie case as effect to these nine stores you don't even mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.860" offset="11813846">He recognizes we're making a prima facie case with respect to area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.494" offset="11832445">Now, there's been some talk here about this bulk exhibits being part of the record and we could approve everything from this bulk exhibits and leaving out the question of who had the burden of proof of proving a cost justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.319" offset="11891691">It is not a coincidence that these bulk exhibits are not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.485" offset="11912380">In fact it's my why understanding that they were never physically before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.111" offset="11930875">What these bulk exhibits were, were the work papers, the work papers which the Borden people used in making their cost study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.073" offset="11970685">They worked as Mr. Ball quite properly said, Bulk up and made available to the Government in checking their work papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.847" offset="12005794">But they were never submitted to the Court either by the Government or by Borden because nobody thought they were relevant except in checking the general figures that Borden was doing because Borden wasn't before that Court making a justification on a store-by-store basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.014" offset="12082489">And that's why those work papers are not before this Court and --</text>

            <text syncTime="3017.526" offset="12176530">As I try to point out yesterday, all we are insisting on is before they classify stores and then make a cost justification by groups that they make sure that the classification reflects the particular cost savings they're talking about specifically as Your Honor said perfectly clear from his whole case that there's a great deal of cost saving as the result of volume.This is particularly true in delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.582" offset="12288752">Obviously, on a per quart basis or per hundred dollars of sale basis, it cost less to serve big stores and small stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.731" offset="12333369">Well, to the extent that there are volume savings, we don't say that they can't classify for cost justification purposes stores with equivalent volumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.028" offset="12370568">But what we do say is you can't do what Borden did and take all independent stores that have anywhere as from a 150 points a day to 750 points a day and classify them while your classifying the chains separately who as Mr. Ball admits take on the average less than the 750 to the extent of volume as a factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.345" offset="12643809">We think a decree which would require the Borden Company to make whatever discount brackets they wish to set up based on whatever differentials they want to set up available to anybody who can qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.089" offset="12706816">Fairly simply decree of that nature would do the trick.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.374" offset="12743910">If Borden thinks there are savings and quantities which there obviously are and that's the major one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.540" offset="12768569">They can set up a quantity discount which is open to everybody and the decree should say that if they want to have discounts based on quantity, it has to be open to Schubert as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.158" offset="12815067">Now, to the extent that there are other factors, they can also set up their discount on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.222" offset="12843384">In store services which Mr. Ball talked about, it's quite true that if a store whether it be an independent or a chain requires the truck driver to bring the milk into the store and deposit it in thing that takes somewhat more time and would be as far as we know, for a fully justifiable basis for having a differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.507" offset="12948501">Now, if they want to say people will take in-store services will be paid, will pay ex -- extra or say the others that don't will get a discount they can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.570" offset="12988729">We will allow that in the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.949" offset="12994267">All we're saying is that on these two or three of four major factors which are the only factors Justice Stewart that anybody would really want to set up with discount for, they want to set up as discount for, the decree should simply state that these discounts are to be specified and be available to everybody is eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.236" offset="13099384">And that's all you did in a decree and that would eliminate all problems, we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.996" offset="13122476">The classification difficulties that we got in cost justification, is merely because they didn't do this in their original method of giving discounts here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.694" offset="13345249">Two, that the bigger independents would probably immediately got a larger discount and three, those bigger independents, the type of people who were trying to compete with change who wanted to take advantage of it could get even larger discounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.238" offset="13411391">Now, it may very well be for example with respect to the Schubert chain but under the present system where it doesn't know and was never been told that the -- it gets a higher discount if it doesn't take in-store services that they are taking in-stores services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.765" offset="13473458">But under my plan, of course, they would be told if you take in-store services will cost you a little bit more and they would have the choice of deciding whether they want to take advantage of cost that way you are not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.724" offset="13669376">Let me state our general thesis at the beginning again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.656" offset="13685049">If you want a class -- if you want to cost justify discrimination between types of store and do so by a cost justification which classifies stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.670" offset="13761118">This classification has to be based upon cost saving factors which are applicable to all of one class and none of the other and which account for the differentials -- a very simple basic position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.324" offset="13823707">Now, the Bowman discount schedule appears on page 67 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.584" offset="13868743">This is the Bowman discount schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.809" offset="13877729">Actually there are several Bowman discount schedules in this record they were variation as they went along but I think for present purposes we can stick with the one took in June 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.215" offset="13931332">There are minor variants and one additional factor which is thrown into the pot and the later schedules to account for somewhat greater differential.</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.245" offset="13995384">You will note that -- this is the published discount schedule unlike the Borden discount schedule in terms applies to everybody but in fact, supplies only to the independents and you'll notice that it's similar to the Borden discount schedule and that for the independents they have a graduated discount except that it's much broader and starts lower and goes by more minute percentages and actually they calculated within these figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.930" offset="14154209">For example, somebody getting 135 points, I gather, would get 6.7 or something in between this and which have more detail breakdown of the independent discounts up until 200 points on page 67 it only goes up to 150 points, but if you will turn over the page on page 68, you'll see that within a month and a half after this discount schedule was put into effect, they actually raised it to 8% for up -- for over 200 points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.847" offset="14301853">Now, this was the published schedule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3735.073" offset="15046760">In other words, assuming if they both got exactly the average at least two stores of this one third sample were not getting 200 points but were getting over three times to this and yet they were cut off -- they were cut off when they reached the 200 point level.</text>

            <text syncTime="3925.180" offset="15807133">They said, what they did was they calculated by time studies and other allocations what they figured was a cost per quart of serving the chains and a cost per quart of serving the independents at any given volume level for cost per quarter saving the chains of that volume level and the cost per quart at saving the independents at that volume level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.441" offset="15936178">And they compared these two costs per quart of serving these two groups at any volume level and their comparison showed according to their calculations in each instance that there was a sufficient difference of the cost for selling into the chains was sufficiently less to account for the 3% differential between the highest bracket or in fact to account for whatever differential that would be at that volume level for independents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.495" offset="16080374">At least this was true above 160 or 180 points.</text>

            <text syncTime="5076.205" offset="20411267">But Government here wasn't wasting its time bringing an action against these people to have fairness with respect to nine stores, two A&amp;P stores and five or four, eight independent stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.313" offset="20467691">What we are interested in -- what we were attempting to get and what everybody recognize below was this entire differential broken down for the Chicago area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.574" offset="20508756">What we did with Bowman as with Borden is have an example of a nine stores in two parts of two routes stores close together.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.810" offset="20553686">For the same purpose and doing the same thing to show, again, what we thought was obvious and what we think is unnecessary under this Court's decision in the Morton Salt case that these stores were in competition because our friends in Bowman argued vociferously that they weren't in competition, that this whole business of competition was beloning that people don't shop from supermarket to supermarket, that they have their own favorite stores and that they extent of competition and therefore the effect of this price differential was meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.209" offset="20707286">Well, as again, we thought that was unnecessary to really prove but to prove it conclusively, we took a sampling.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.192" offset="20735185">We could have taken the whole city of Chicago if we want and done and made a much broader sample but that would have been exactly to fly into the phase of what this Court said in Morton Salt, the Federal Trade Commission we shouldn't do and just wasting time in doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.031" offset="20790565">But we took a small sample of two routes and said, “All right now, you say that they're not in competition, here is the people that go into both stores” and that all there to this alleged fact that we prove this case -- we proved a prima facie case solely with respect to nine stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.355" offset="20859841">The Court didn't think so and we didn't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.749" offset="20873425">You'll read the Government's trial brief which is not printed in the record but which is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.621" offset="20904876">You'll find that our prime facie case discuss this primarily as our prima facie case the discount schedule and then uses these nine stores as an example to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.207" offset="20951270">And you'll find that Bowman's reply to these things treats it the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.339" offset="20991812">Let me say briefly about the alleged proof store to store with respect to the nine stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.736" offset="21029428">This appears in Exhibit 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.060" offset="21050640">Exhibit 14 starts at page 328 of the record and chapter one of that is what purports to be a test of these individual stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.017" offset="21106542">Now, let's see what Mr. Bergfeld who is making the report here, says he did and remember that Mr. Bergfeld is that he never spoke to any of the individual store about anything, and I just got this information from Bowman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.546" offset="21164638">Now, what did he do in this test?</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.124" offset="21170907">Did he speak to people or didn't?</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.452" offset="21180207">Well, reading at the bottom of page 329 here what he said he did, “Well each store on this route, all deliveries during the week of March 14th to 19th were included in the study.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.201" offset="21227227">This accounted for a variations and order of size throughout a weekly period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.812" offset="21245722">Each store -- each customer's actual volume and product mix were used as the basis for computing delivery cost, platform cost and list prices.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.439" offset="21288249">In other words, they did find out what the average actual volume and product mix of these stores were.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.961" offset="21314267">Did they make a survey of their customer services?</text>

            <text syncTime="5309.105" offset="21342898">Delivery cost was based on a regular service available and generally provided to the type of store.</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.698" offset="21377275">Since the driver and its equipment must be prepared to perform any or all the group of services setup for independent stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.427" offset="21412174">The cost of that group is calculated as part of delivery cost and it's incorporated into the discount schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.892" offset="21442058">This includes daily cash payment, any optional services, beyond a sidewalk on floor delivery, conversely only of the essential element, services are provided for chain store outlets.</text>

            <text syncTime="5820.677" offset="23389121">The record shows that the time studies on which the independent cost experts employed by Bowman calculated their cost curve were conducted in 1949.</text>

            <text syncTime="6015.582" offset="24168824">That our -- our study was made in advance and that the arrangement of the cost is such that in any store regardless of whom who might own it could qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.468" offset="24208321">And I also would like to point out as I go along that I think Government counsel doesn't have the proper respect for the acumen of the independent businessman who run these stores and the knowledge which they have of the cost factors which are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.511" offset="24260462">Unfortunately, as I also point out, the record is thinner than I would like on this point because it is a point which is really being argued here and was not developed during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.757" offset="24305497">But I'd like to bring that out as I go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.341" offset="24315841">We are somewhat limited by the record we have because of the manner in which the case developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6057.419" offset="24336112">As I first indicated at page 311 of the record is the first discount schedule which Bowman put into effect adopting these principles and it was put into effect in January of 1953 about a month after the entry of the Dean decree which the Court will recall Judge Campbell relied on when the case was previously up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.156" offset="24415107">Probably after the Dean decree relying on the time studies which had previously been made Bowman adopted it dramatically new type of discount schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6086.342" offset="24451783">And I think it's significant to note that this schedule avoids a problem which is frequently present in classification cases of whether the person who buys 99 points and gets into one bracket is being unfairly treated as against someone who buys 101 points because sometimes you get a sharp, you have the problem of drawing the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.122" offset="24530881">Now, we don't say that we are by law compelled to do this, but I say that we were advised by our independent experts it would be good business and it would be a lawful way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6115.895" offset="24570065">So that, you'll note there are these probably 40 different would appear to be brackets on the schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6123.002" offset="24598486">But even within the schedule, for example, if you'll note between 210 and 220 points, the percent of discounts is 6.1 to 6.2 which in turn means that there is variation even within that range.</text>
            <text syncTime="6138.190" offset="24659195">So that if the volume was increased to 215, for example, with discount would have been 6.15% or 217, 6.17% every additional quart of milk because of the paralleling of the graduated scale would cost curve entitled the customer to a slightly larger discount.</text>

            <text syncTime="6176.900" offset="24814049">That doesn't involve in our case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6179.199" offset="24823244">Now, this is significant for this reason which I think goes to the integrity of the entire system and I also would like to say, that it had been my understanding that no challenge was made to the good faith our system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.945" offset="24878205">I interpret Solomon -- Mr. Solomon's remark as perhaps suggesting the contrary, but it's my understanding that the position of the Government throughout the litigation has not doubted the good faith of the manner on which the Bowman Dairy Company attempted to comply with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6206.873" offset="24933898">Now, the reason this is significant, the reason I want to stress it before the Court is that, Bowman had hundreds of customers and it is almost literally true that every customer receive a different net price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.379" offset="24991995">They were -- because of these graduating changes and discounts, you have literally hundreds of different net pricing being charged to the Bowman customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.048" offset="25026685">And therefore, there was a myriad of prima facie price differentials and price discriminations which was incumbent upon Bowman to be in the position to justify.</text>
            <text syncTime="6239.683" offset="25065138">And with respect to that myriad of price differentials ranging all the way from no discount at the very bottom level all the way up to 8% at the 400 and over level which was in effect at this time, there is no question raised by the Government as to the integrity or validity of the system by making all of these price differentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.009" offset="25146431">The case which is presented is solely relating to the possibility that there may be a few extremely large independents who should have got an even larger discount which would have made them exactly equal to the chains.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.663" offset="25201079">So they were concerned not with the large body of customers served by Bowman but rather with the possibility of a few independents who have been denied to fair opportunity to qualify for the same discount as a chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6288.018" offset="25258548">And I'll try and show that they have been denied any such opportunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="6293.098" offset="25278819">As I said Your Honor, if the cost of serving them were the same as the cost of serving a chain, you could not -- unless there was some other defense under the statute like good faith meaning of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.247" offset="25319466">If the costs are the same, certainly the price has to be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.743" offset="25333467">We don't dispute that in the slightest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6311.061" offset="25350708">Now, so our discount schedule is rather dramatically different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6317.775" offset="25377562">We believe that it's the kind of bracket discount schedule which is usually presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="6324.162" offset="25403058">Now, I'd also like to show the prima facie case which the Government developed in this connection and again, I said it doesn't matter when I talked about the prima facie case whether I'm saying they proved nine stores and nine price differentials or whether they are taken as illustrative of the problem as a whole because either way, we met their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.091" offset="25478813">First of all, bear in mind that this schedule went into effect in 1953 and after this Court remanded the cost to the District Court, on January 11, 1955 the Government moved to reopen the record for the taking of additional evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6358.991" offset="25542447">And the Court granted the motion and advised the Government they would have wide latitude in presenting such case as they needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.495" offset="25568465">I might say parenthetically, the Government in effect abandoned the evidence that had been involved before which related to many years previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="6372.928" offset="25598140">The case really started all over as a new lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6377.498" offset="25616426">The Government then took the period from January of 1955 to November of 1955 when the pre-trial order containing their prima facie case was stipulated and entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="6387.567" offset="25656759">And that entire prima facie case is found at the record and the record beginning at page 57 and it runs through page 61 with some schedules and exhibit attached thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6398.320" offset="25699704">The heart of the case is in the two schedules on pages 62 and 63.</text>
            <text syncTime="6403.260" offset="25719453">And I'd like to point out that during this time, the Government at an ample opportunity to select stores which would fairly present the problem which they felt needed to be presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6415.581" offset="25768772">And what kind of stores did they select?</text>
            <text syncTime="6418.217" offset="25779325">They selected two delivery routes, each of which contains examples of chain store units and independents store units.</text>
            <text syncTime="6426.660" offset="25813076">The independents as it would be natural presenting the plaintiff point of view on the independents in which they particularly rely are among the 2% of the largest stores served by Bowman.</text>
            <text syncTime="6439.855" offset="25865843">The -- a rebuttal exhibit put in subsequently by the Government in its own -- when it came to rebuttal time and I might say all the evidence relating to average cost and average classification is the Government rebuttal exhibit evidence, our evidence is not based on any kind of averaging of the size of the stores or anything of that character.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.456" offset="25944315">The stores which they selected, as I say, excuse me, this rebuttal exhibit shows that 98% of the independent stores purchase less than 200 points per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="6469.044" offset="25982663">So naturally, they selected independents which purchase in excess of 200 points to present their case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6562.671" offset="26357154">There is no purpose in publishing a discount schedule containing brackets in which no one falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="6568.466" offset="26380351">And a logical reason for stopping is this is the group of customers who buy pursuant to this published discount schedule distributed throughout the markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6577.575" offset="26416713">And these particular customers, the best examples the Government could find in the Chicago area and I might point out the Government's complaint is limited to Chicago area as specifically defined.</text>

            <text syncTime="6599.239" offset="26503440">It is true and I might jump ahead a moment to point out that the rebuttal exhibit which was put in three years later, the day the record closed identified some stores purchasing over 400.</text>
            <text syncTime="6611.644" offset="26553072">But it doesn't show where those are.</text>
