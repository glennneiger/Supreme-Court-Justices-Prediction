            <text syncTime="21.308" offset="188583">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.988" offset="199346">This case involves the right to a trial by jury in a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.167" offset="232051">The District Court judge denied the demand for a jury trial and his reasons briefly were that upon a consideration of the issues raised in the complaint and answer, he concluded that the action was purely equitable although he found that this complaint included a demand for the payment of $60,000, allegedly do by reason of the breach of contract of a facts or rather scan.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.150" offset="391920">The petitioner in this case held a franchise for the use of the trademark, Dairy Queen, in the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.147" offset="431940">And this agreement was made in October of 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.343" offset="456704">The agreement provided that the total consideration for the payment of this franchise was $150,000, which a thousand was paid at the execution of the agreement and the balance was to be paid from the proceeds, 50% of the proceeds of the sale of sub-franchises provided that beginning with October of 1955, there was to be paid not less than $18,625 per annum.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.996" offset="591391">This payment was made regularly until October of 1954, and it was not made at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.714" offset="634232">But the parties in January of 1955 reached a normal agreement that thereafter, the obligation of the petitioner was to merely pay 50% of the sales of sub-franchises and there would no longer be any need to meet this annual minimum payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.921" offset="731094">This continued for six years thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.540" offset="749484">The parties were harmonious until August of 1960 when the plaintiff in the action below, took the position that there was now due and owing the entire balance which was some $60,000 payable under the contract and the contention of the petitioner raised that was a repudiation of the oral agreement which had modified the original written agreement and which had been implemented for some six years.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Egnal</label>
            <text syncTime="205.539" offset="925550">Yes sir, made in January of 1955, and as I say, implemented for the next six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.784" offset="954493">Now, when the complaint was filed, it -- or I'm ahead of myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.190" offset="984168">In August of 1960, the position of the plaintiff below changed and it then demanded the payment of the balance to one of the contract which was indicated by a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.345" offset="1056789">That's Exhibit C attached to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.452" offset="1069223">And in that letter, it expressly recited that unless you pay the balance due and owing under the contract, we will consider that a material breach and we will cancel the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.798" offset="1130559">That position was not recognized by the petitioner and subsequently a complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.792" offset="1158562">In the complaint, it was sort to enjoin on the theory that the -- that the franchise had been cancelled by this x-party declaration of the plaintiff below to cancel the franchise, restrain the petitioner from many further use of the trademark and they will restrain the petitioner from collecting any moneys which it would be an incident of a continued use of the franchise and for a judgment of the amount due and owing under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.215" offset="1316237">Our position briefly is that while there was cloth in this complaint, some equitable attire that basically, before there could be any equitable relief, this plaintiff had to establish that there was a breach of a contract, that there was an amount due under the contract.In other words, he would have to sustain the -- the legal course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.722" offset="1446222">And if that could be sustained, he would then become entitled to equitable relief.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="341.707" offset="1470151">What is the equitable relief or the equitable attire, whatever that phrase that you (Voice Overlap)?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Egnal</label>
            <text syncTime="346.860" offset="1490840">Well he -- in his prayers, in his prayers, he uses the conventional prayers that would be found in a complaint equity asking that the Court enjoin this defendant, the petitioner, from any further use of a trade name.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.258" offset="1568371">He uses a phrase that the Court should grant an accounting for the amount due and owing under the contract and uses the -- the terminology which is peculiar to equity proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.653" offset="1633991">That is what I mean by the attire.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.478" offset="1645275">Now, we take the position that regardless of how much there is in evaluating this complaint, how much there maybe a scribe for the legal course of action, if there is a legal course of action involved in this preceding, a right to a jury trial cannot be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.805" offset="1746631">And of course, we -- we rely on what this Court said both in its majority and my minority opinion in Beacon Theatres versus Westover which has recently been put directly, it seems to me in point on this proposition in the Thermo-Stitch case.</text>

            <text syncTime="486.692" offset="2050173">Thank you Your Honor, I'm sorry for (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="490.389" offset="2064906">The question here involved is a very simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.441" offset="2081102">And that is whether the complaint states a legal cause of action entitling this defendant to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.634" offset="2121958">Petitioner in its question presented to the Court, has limited himself to the complaint although we do not have to so limit it in order to find that all that is involved here are matters of equity consideration as we have long understood them.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.929" offset="2211088">I would like to point out to the Court, however, that the question presented is an error for two primary reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.670" offset="2258004">The question presented assumes the conclusion that there is a legal cause of action found in this complaint as he states where a complaint asserts a legal cause of action and an equitable cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.621" offset="2325817">In other words, the question presents, assume there is a legal question presented which we disagree and we will point out to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.481" offset="2365315">Further in the question presented, it is stated that the basis of both cause of action is the omission of defendant to pay some of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.457" offset="2413171">Now, this is not a true nor an accurate presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.073" offset="2435636">The basis of this cause of action is not based on a contract which was cancelled and which the District Court which I will go into has so found on a preliminary injunction hearing but the fact, what the defendant did subsequent to the cancellation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.285" offset="2524557">Now, in the complaint, there're several very important statements made which have nothing at all to do with an alleged $60,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.634" offset="2569906">It is true that the statement is made in the complaint as a background operative fact that this defendant, petitioner here was in default in the amount of $60,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.548" offset="2641586">It further states that the plaintiff, the respondent herein, is the owner of the Dairy Queen trademark in Pennsylvania and throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.194" offset="2688188">By a system of franchise agreements and territory agreements throughout the United States, it has under its various licenses over 3000 such Dairy Queen stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.718" offset="2742209">These stores are similar in appearance and the purpose of having a strict control over these stores is so that the public may know and believe that this product which they purchased is the same throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.456" offset="2813158">The defendant was licensed among other things to use this trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.137" offset="2831966">It's so used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.499" offset="2837400">It complied with the contract and so far as making basic annual payments for a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.575" offset="2869687">It ceased making these annual payments and as the defendant asserts in its answer, not by way of a counter claim or a cross claim that this agreement was modified whether we call it a reformation of the contract or a novation in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.205" offset="2952234">He says it was modified so that he no longer had to make this annual payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.215" offset="2976266">Furthermore, the complaint also averse that after this contract was cancelled by the defendant for a failure to pay not only this sum of money but other sums of money through a third independent person that the defendant thereafter began unjustly in reaching itself, continue to hold itself out as a licensed Dairy Queen operator, continue to receive the moneys and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.416" offset="3117014">In August of 1960, pursuant to paragraph 9 of the agreement, which is attached to the complaint as Exhibit A, the plaintiff cancelled that contract which it had a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.487" offset="3189321">Now, it is true that one of the issues raised by the answer is whether we had a right to cancel or not and I will get to that as it is a very basic premise in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.850" offset="3258807">In December, we filed a motion for preliminary injunction, and that preliminary injunction was heard, evidence and witness is produced, oral argument and briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.216" offset="3324217">On December 28, the District Court, the same judge herein, has denied the petitioner here, his right to a jury trial, made findings of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.681" offset="3374059">These findings of fact are in the appendix D in brief and opposition by the respondent herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.335" offset="3416691">We do not say that these findings of fact and conclusions of law are res judicata as to the petitioner hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.519" offset="3453471">But they do have a certain standing as to what were the facts are in this matter, and this is what we get to the crux of the problem that the complaint herein is not based on the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.144" offset="3519927">The District Court found that the contract was breached whether it'd be for reason of default of payment of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.217" offset="3548244">That is only the operative fact for bringing the complaint into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.318" offset="3568619">The fact that it was breached, this defendant continued to collect moneys, it had no right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.869" offset="3602892">It continued to use the Dairy Queen trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.379" offset="3616893">It continued to hold itself out as a licensed Dairy Queen operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.658" offset="3641971">The Court granted, under the question of balancing the equity in the case, a limited preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.097" offset="3679796">This was December 28, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.904" offset="3699022">Defendant, although the complaint had been filed in November, had not filed an answer of any type at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.685" offset="3746147">It appealed the preliminary injunction which was affirmed but approximately two months after -- after the Court had rendered this decision in the preliminary injunction, it filed its answer and the answer did not again include any counterclaim or cross complaint, it merely raised some antitrust issues, the same that we were barred from any relief, not asking for any affirmative relief and further stated this modification in the contract.</text>
