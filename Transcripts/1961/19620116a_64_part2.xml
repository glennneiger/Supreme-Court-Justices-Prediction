            <text syncTime="49.738" offset="302373">And, I wanted to make clear that on this record, on the theory of the trial, an essential part of the government's case was an explanation of the operation of this electronic device which clearly was not made out due to the inadequate, incredible testimony of the government inspector.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.614" offset="561821">Now, coming back to the government's alleged distinction of Regina versus Middlesex, I think it must become fairly obvious on an examination of the record that, certainly, their distinction that Judge Wyzanski acted without knowledge of the government's case is a distinction without any validity because, after all the eight days of testimony, and all the proceedings and briefs that had taken place and colloquies with counsel, he knew much more than the judge who claimed to have read the depositions in the Middlesex Justice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.006" offset="727437">In passing, I ask the Court to read the Queen's Bench decision, not the English Report decision which is quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.389" offset="752933">The Queen's Bench decision is the one referred to in the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.886" offset="774875">Now, we urge upon the Court to continue the historic principle that a verdict of acquittal is not reviewable and, certainly, should not be reviewed in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.255" offset="840391">We feel by giving an independent judiciary, this non-reviewable right is no more horrendous than giving the government attorney the right to nolle pros in criminal proceedings which right is non-reviewable on a much broader scale.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="223.972" offset="999215">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.432" offset="1017083">In this very extraordinary case, we base our case upon three propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.262" offset="1052400">First, we assert the basic right of people to be heard in the prosecution of a valid indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.959" offset="1083225">When a defendant has been charged with crime by the grand jury in a lawful indictment, then, we submit, the district judge has no power to bar prosecution by entering a judgment of acquittal without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.577" offset="1149680">I simply illustrate the proposition by putting a converse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.730" offset="1170265">If a judge were trying a criminal defendant without a jury and, at the end of hearing two character witnesses for the defense, the judge were to say “nothing can convince me that this scoundrel is innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.015" offset="1235466">I find him guilty and enter judgment forthwith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="287.282" offset="1252498">That that judgment would not merely be erroneous, but that the judgment would be void and could be collaterally attacked years later on habeas corpus or under --</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="301.373" offset="1308818">No, because my hypothesis in this case, the judge was trying the case without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.695" offset="1338180">I meant -- I think I stated that in the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.583" offset="1345703">I meant to.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.406" offset="1349047">No, because he would've denied a fair hearing and, also, our case is the converse, we submit, that essentially the same proposition stands.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="320.351" offset="1384782">The difficulty is, Mr. Solicitor, that the rights are correlative.</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="325.434" stopTime="331.125">

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="331.452" offset="1429191">But I shall submit that they should be correlative and will go on to develop my reasons, if I may, a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.395" offset="1456985">Our second proposition is that, where the judge -- where the District Court has exercised this non-judicial function and is, therefore, refusing to try the indictment, that mandamus is the proper remedy to expunge the non-judicial action and to order the Court to proceed to do its duty to put the case to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.302" offset="1552593">My third proposition has to be, of course, is that the constitutional limitation against placing a defendant in double jeopardy does not bar further prosecution of this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.183" offset="1604106">Before developing these points, I think it might be helpful if I were to describe once again what was involved in this case and what took place at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.946" offset="1659173">The indictment was under the False Statements Act and for a conspiracy to submit false statements to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.522" offset="1693445">The defendant corporation had agreed to manufacture and sell certain radiosondes, a device which is dropped from an airplane at a high altitude, a parachute then opens, there is a certain shock at that point, and the parachute then allows the device to float to earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.596" offset="1781739">The device is used in weather forecasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.921" offset="1795009">It transmits signals which, if the device is accurate, enable an instrument on the ground to record signals which, in turn, tell the operator what the temperature, the humidity, and the barometric pressure are at the point in the air where the radiosonde did.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.295" offset="1884557">For example, if the radiosonde to take temperature, for an illustration, where the height where the temperature was -50 degrees centigrade, the radiosonde might transmit the Morse Code signal BN.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.339" offset="1948714">At 40 degrees, it would transmit QX.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.111" offset="1963865">At 30 degrees, another pair of letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.877" offset="1978911">It was, therefore, obviously of the greatest importance that the machine be adjusted in a certain way that the signal BN, which the operator on the ground knew meant fif -- -50 degrees centigrade, in fact was transmitted at -50 degrees centigrade.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.130" offset="2059891">And, these tests involved in the case involved testing the radiosondes for the accuracy of the signals that they transmitted with respect to temperature, humidity, and the barometric pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.013" offset="2127391">The charge was that the test results which were given by the operators of the testing devices to the government were falsified and this, of course, if true, would be a violation of the False Statements Act and a conspiracy to submit such false information would be a criminal conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.006" offset="2235434">The defe -- the government, after the jury was empanelled, made a very short opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.639" offset="2277961">The Assistant United States Attorney was careful to explain that the government's case fell into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.111" offset="2311816">The first, he said, would be largely technical and he didn't need to put it in at all, but he thought that it would be helpful to the jury to explain what a radiosonde was and, also, to explain the procedures for testing the accuracy of the calibration of the transmitting machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.270" offset="2388407">So, he said he would, first, call two witnesses who would describe the technical aspects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.274" offset="2412440">And then, he went on to say that he would call other witnesses who would actually describe the falsification of the tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.096" offset="2451728">He did not state the exact number, but it's apparent that there were a number of witnesses from the plant who would testify about the falsification of the test and, indeed, the actual conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.367" offset="2500838">He didn't go into detail about what their testimony would be, then followed four or five days of trial, during which, two witnesses tried to explain radiosondes and the procedure for testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.122" offset="2567816">It's difficult to describe those four or five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.751" offset="2594356">They were -- it was extremely long, extremely painful.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.736" offset="2614314">The witnesses turned out to be rather inept.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.691" offset="2630092">The judge repeatedly interrupted the witnesses and, I think, one reading the record would include that he contributed in very large part to the difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.412" offset="2680978">For example, he was extremely precise in preventing witnesses from stating any conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.515" offset="2721416">He objected, for example, to the witness saying that the signal that came at -50 degrees centigrade would be BN.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.986" offset="2755271">The witness must say that the signal would be dit-dit-da-da da-da-dit-dit so that he wouldn't be stating a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.609" offset="2793827">At another point, the witness, describing how the radiosonde was put into a chamber where the atmospheric conditions which it would experience could be simulated, the judge objected to the use of the word “chamber” because he said it might refer to his offices or it might refer to a chamber pot and the word “chamber” was, therefore, an improper one.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.720" offset="2898213">He objected to the use of the word “gave,” one witness -- one man in the plant gave a radiosonde or some other part to another man in the plant, because he said “that's a legal conclusion and you can't embody any legal conclusions in your testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.251" offset="2968325">You must say he handed it to him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="718.989" offset="2979297">Well, after some days of this, the witnesses not unnaturally, began to become tense and I make no assertion that they did not say many inconsistent things.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.949" offset="3031124">Whether the inconsistencies were serious or not is a matter of dispute or a matter of judgment, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.855" offset="3062784">The Circuit Court of Appeals described what had happened in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.194" offset="3084100">I'm looking at page 50 and 51 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.721" offset="3102281">“The testimony of the two principal witnesses, to whom we have specifically referred, were certainly confused and conflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.220" offset="3136240">It is clear from the record before us that the confusion and conflicts in these witnesses' testimony was due in no minor part to the judge's persistent, sharp, and sometimes caustic cross-examination through their direct examination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="775.023" offset="3203427">And then, if the Court will bear with me, over on page 53, right near the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.853" offset="3230804">This record provides a prime example of the consequences of overzealous participation in the examination of witnesses by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.540" offset="3265494">It is clear that the judge's sharp persistent and almost badgering question and caustic remarks first made the witnesses weary and overcautious and then confused them into inconsistencies and, in addition, disrupted the orderly presentation of the government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.291" offset="3340518">I think that I will leave the point about the conduct of the trial there with simply one observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.472" offset="3373223">When one recalls that this is a small circuit and that the judge at the trial, he's an extraordinarily able man, a judge of 15 years experience, for the Senior Circuit Judge to administer that review, which must have cost him great personal distress, is I think the best evidence of the provocation to which he was put and of the manner in which these five days of trial had been conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.476" offset="3489311">After the first four or five days, the district judge excused the jury, turned apparently to the Assistant United States Attorney, and said that there are many kinds of character in life and one of the important kinds of character is the ability to recognize that he has no case and the willingness or courage to dismiss his case when that becomes evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.644" offset="3605922">And, he then commented on the unreliability of these two technical witnesses and allowed the prosecution 15 minutes to decide whether to drop its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.492" offset="3665377">At that point, the United States Attorney, himself, came into the courtroom and there was a colloquy between the judge and the United States Attorney and his assistant which appears at page 362 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.974" offset="3759313">The judge had already stated again, for the benefit of the United States Attorney, why he thought that the witnesses were unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.191" offset="3808110">He referred particularly to this use of the word “superiors” which was certainly an extraordinary malapropism but, if one reads that part of the record, he will find that the witness was describing a standard testing procedure and not what anyone had done, and that there was, I think, no possibility that this was a deliberate effort to prejudice the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.478" offset="3897240">He was just a technically educated man, ignorant of the English language.</text>

            <text syncTime="967.648" offset="3973935">The other thing which preceded it, the judge said, as an illustration of the witnesses' misuse of words, that in describing the method of measuring humidity, which is most accurately measured by the use of hair, that when the witness had said he knew only about hair, that it must be virgin hair, as one would speak of virgin timber or virgin wool or virgin sulfur, the judge had engaged in a colloquy which I think need not be repeated but, obviously, was of color humor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.811" offset="4126595">Having referred back to these incidents, the judge then said that no jury would bring in a verdict against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.290" offset="4164524">And, Mr. Richardson said “I think, in the first place, we should make it clear that this witness was called for a limited purpose, not central to establishment that wrongdoing had occur,” and he went on to say he understood he was explaining the nature of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.887" offset="4226905">The government would rely entirely on other witnesses to show that the test were not carried out and, in fact, were falsified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.464" offset="4261177">We believe, therefore, whatever the jury's impression of this witness generally, this judgment as to whether the defendants were guilty would and should rest upon the testimony of witnesses who will testify that, under the instructions of the defendants, they did not follow the procedures prescribed and that they, in fact, falsified those procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.420" offset="4345083">Then, Mr. Caner, the assistant, explained over on the next page “the Court has not heard one-tenth of the testimony in this case and none of the fraud testimony.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.782" offset="4394506">After that colloquy, the judge said that he would allow the case to go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.903" offset="4418957">Then, the witness, Robert Rosenholm, was called and he was to be a witness and he was a witness until the actual falsification of these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.442" offset="4473187">For example, one of the tests was to discover whether the mechanism had been manufactured in such a way that it would survive this shot when the parachute opened and stopped its decent, and it would be -- the radiosonde would be subjected to a similar shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.255" offset="4564407">What was done, according to the witness, was that the radiosonde would be put into the testing device that simulated the conditions it would experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.021" offset="4611427">It would be made to broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.352" offset="4624802">The results would be recorded on a tape and, if they were accurate, well and good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.352" offset="4660746">Then, what should have taken place would be that the shot would be administered to the device.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.384" offset="4684884">It would be put back in the gadget and a second tape would be made showing how accurately it recorded after the shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.049" offset="4727620">But, what witness said was done in the plant was that two tapes were made before the shot and that, then, one tape was made after the shot and that the tapes given to the government inspector, who was charged with determining whether the devices were accurate, would be the two tapes before the shot and one would be represented to be a post-shot tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.339" offset="4832737">Another part of his testimony concerned the making of what I think I could call false tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.532" offset="4865546">One was suppose to record what signals the radiosonde actually emitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.014" offset="4891460">If one know that, at -50 degrees centigrade, it was supposed to emit the signal BN and the signal PT came instead, why, he could record BN on the tape, gives the tape to the government inspector and, thereby, mislead him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.150" offset="4979963">Rosenholm also testified that this was done and he was describing in some detail exactly how the test was administered and the false information was given to the operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.370" offset="5048822">He said that the false information was on a car and then, after what I recall to be about two pages of the record, he said, “No, wait a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.875" offset="5090826">I see where I went wrong now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.511" offset="5097409">It wasn't on a card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.092" offset="5103783">The card stayed with the radiosonde all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.446" offset="5121128">I would go to the file and get the information and give it to the operator who was falsifying the test.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.875" offset="5154879">So, there was, in the sense, an inconsistency but it was also an inconsistency that the witness, himself, called attention to and said, “No, I was wrong,” and it came after a good deal of this badgering inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.193" offset="5212139">The witness then went on to deal with the alleged conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.414" offset="5240978">He testified that a time had come when he went to an office in North Dayton, the town near the plant, where a company lawyer was present and that various other employees were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.661" offset="5305971">The question then that came up, as it obviously might, about the admissibility of this testimony, which we're not concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.852" offset="5338781">And, he was asked -- well, excuse me just a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.977" offset="5355290">What he was going to testify to, as nearly everyone knew, was that, at that meeting, the company lawyer and responsible company officials had had this falsification called to their attention and that they had determined that it should continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.934" offset="5423104">So, this was an essential part of the alleged conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.502" offset="5477334">I -- my impression from the record is that Judge Wyzanski had learned this, too, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.001" offset="5503352">So, that since it was alleged that the conspiracy ran until November 1957, it was important to the prosecution to admit as to -- the meeting was some time before November 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.780" offset="5574510">The witness was asked before he gave this testimony, Mr. Justice Brennan, on page 552 of the record, “Did you have a discussion with him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.902" offset="5622993">“Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.979" offset="5627277">“Approximately when did you have the discussion?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.947" offset="5639189">Witness: “I am not sure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.598" offset="5649742">The Court: “Can't you tell us whether it was 1958 or -- “Witness: “It was 1958.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.513" offset="5673462">“Can't you tell us, on reflection, whether it was hot weather or cold weather?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.463" offset="5689240">“I believe it was in the month of February, but I'm not sure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.389" offset="5708884">The point I'm trying to emphasize is that the witness had never been very precise, that a very suggestive question had been put to him by the judge because if you say “was it 1958 or --” it suggest 1959, and if you don't know whether it's 1957 or 1958, the judge thought 1958 is the earliest possible date, and a not too strong a witness might easily fall in with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.977" offset="5811284">Shortly later, there was a recess for the evening and, the next morning, I turn now to page 559, the Assistant United States Mr. -- Attorney, Mr. Caner, asked his first question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.810" offset="5882650">He said “yesterday, Mr. Rosenholm, you said you believed, at the time you were called by Mr.Hester to his office and introduced to Mr. Tykelan, it was February 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.431" offset="5929148">Are you sure of that date?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.421" offset="5937089">Answer: “No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.310" offset="5944613">“What is your best recollection of what occurred -- of when that occurred?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.158" offset="5964048">Witness: “Approximately, September 1957.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.481" offset="5981288">Then, Mr. Caner sought to approach the Bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.557" offset="5993618">One could only infer that his purpose was to explain what had taken place overnight, but the judge said, “You don't have to approach the Bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.562" offset="6033638">That requires no explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.789" offset="6042520">It isn't in a criminal case correct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.806" offset="6054640">Apparently, meaning that it had been incorrect for Mr. Caner to have said anything to the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.946" offset="6079195">Now, that is sheer inference on my part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.457" offset="6089226">I have no way of knowing what the “it” means, but we do know that it came out somewhat later during cross-examination, when of course the counsel for the defendant made a great issue of this change of date very skillfully and, certainly, with all propriety, that Mr. Caner had spoken to the witness and that the witness had changed his testimony after talking to Mr. Caner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.738" offset="6218376">Now, this appears on page 567 and I think that it, too, is worth calling to your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.559" offset="6253589">Two-thirds down -- two-thirds the way down the page, “when you testified yesterday to February 1958, you believed you were telling the truth, didn't you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.268" offset="6332479">“Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.598" offset="6297788">“You had every intention to tell the truth, didn't you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.120" offset="6315865">“But, you came here this morning and now say it was September 1957.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.908" offset="6334986">Court:“1957?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.709" offset="6346167">Mr. St. Clair, he was counsel for defendants: “That is right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.412" offset="6361004">“Instead of February 1958?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.988" offset="6367274">“That is right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.143" offset="6375946">And then, they go on -- no, I must read at the very -- “and any conversation you had by February of 1958 would be entirely meaningless, so far as this case is concerned, don't you?</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.351" offset="6424743">You know that, don't you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.723" offset="6430281">“Of that, I don't know.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.518" offset="6437491">“Weren't you told that in substance?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.877" offset="6446895">“By whom?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.365" offset="6456822">“By anybody.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.830" offset="6462673">Witness: “I don't recall whether anybody told me this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.835" offset="6474689">Remember that a purist has been keeping after him for some time now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.583" offset="6497677">He doesn't recall whether anybody even told him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.617" offset="6509798">“You don't recall that even though it happened this morning?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.698" offset="6530173">That he was told this date would be meaningless may have happened that morning, for all we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.447" offset="6553161">The Court: “You are being asked about a conversation which must have taken place within the last hour-and-a half.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.312" offset="6576671">“Not necessarily.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.032" offset="6583463">“Were you ask -- told by anybody, not necessarily had been an hour-and-a half?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.588" offset="6605720">The Witness: “Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.394" offset="6612929">I agreed to the fact that Mr. Caner questioned me, Your Honor, and that I had changed the date this morning.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.664" offset="6638007">There was no attempt on his part to conceal anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.595" offset="6653785">Now, what had happened, as it comes out in the later colloquy, was that Mr. Caner had shown him during the interval a statement that he had given to the FBI and had asked him whether this refreshed his recollection as to the date, and the witness had said, yes, he must have been wrong on the stand yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.226" offset="6736227">At this stage, the judge put an end to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.851" offset="6754826">He, first, rebuked the Assistant United States Attorney for speaking to a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.751" offset="6782412">He exonerated him of any intention to do wrong, but charged him with highly improper conduct and he, then, said to the counsel for the defendants that he was prepared to respond to a motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.628" offset="6841866">At that stage, counsel for the defendants moved for a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.606" offset="6861824">I emphasize that this was on their motion and not on the judge's own initiative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.527" offset="6889514">And, the judge called the jury back and explained, referring both to the ineptness of the witnesses and the misconduct as he sought of counsel, that the trial -- that he was putting an end to the trial and that he was directing them to return a verdict of acquittal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1895.719" offset="7686248">Judge Aldrich agreed that there was no power to direct a verdict of acquittal because of the misconduct of counsel but he thought that there would've been power if it had been done because of inadequacies in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.278" offset="7756466">This forced him naturally to consider what was the reason which the judge -- for which the judge acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.649" offset="7785932">He concluded that it was not done because of inadequacies of the evidence, that it was done simply because counsel had engaged in what the judge thought to be misconduct and he concluded that the order was a nullity because the judge has no power to direct a verdict of acquittal for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.100" offset="7871822">As I said a moment ago, we think the court below was undeniably right in holding that the Assistant United States Attorney was not guilty of misconduct and that the criticism of the district judge was an extraordinary aberration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.716" offset="7938278">I'm certain, too, that after studying the record, this Court will agree that the Court of Appeals was correct in saying that any deficiencies in the prosecution's case were largely the result of the confusion created by the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.190" offset="8004106">Whether the district judge was right or wrong in these respects, however, it seems to me to be largely immaterial at this stage in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.594" offset="8041723">For our case necessarily shows, necessarily depends upon showing, not merely that he was wrong but that, even if he were right, he would've had no power under these circumstances to direct the verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.102" offset="8107760">But, I'm speaking of a lack of power in the very stricter sense just as the Court has no power to forbid a grand jury to consider a particular offense or no power to refuse to issue a Bench warrant after the grand jury has returned a valid indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.857" offset="8186755">So, here, we submit that the district judge had no power to enter this order of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.421" offset="8217057">To illustrate the point, I refer back to the illustration I used toward the opening of my argument as a judge -- to the case of the judge who had no power to return a finding of guilty because he had not heard testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.285" offset="8292498">The petitioners here assert that the power of a trial judge to acquit defendants who are properly before him is absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.072" offset="8335653">Much of their case and, as I -- indeed, as I understood Mr. Richenthal, depend -- indeed, all their cases, as I understood Mr. Richenthal, depends upon this proposition which we think both reason and authority show to be in defensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.911" offset="8403048">We deny that a District Court has any such absolute power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.735" offset="8430320">In the first place, the proposition advanced by the petitioners is inconsistent with the fundamental constitutional division of functions between the Executive and Judicial Branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.309" offset="8484655">The Judicial Branch has no power to determine what crimes shall be investigated or what indictments shall be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.801" offset="8522585">Where prosecution upon an information is permissible, that's the responsibility of the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.878" offset="8550902">Where prosecution must be by indictment, it is up to the United States Attorney to determine what crimes to call to the attention of the grand jury or the grand jury may conduct an investigation of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.994" offset="8603355">But, in either event, it's none of the concern of the District Court, or of any other court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.823" offset="8634702">For the Court to interfere in any of those cases would be a plain usurpation of non-judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.738" offset="8670333">Similarly, a judge cannot nolle pros an indictment or, as I've mentioned earlier, refuse to issue a Bench warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.305" offset="8700635">The judge who refuses to permit a trial in the prosecution's evidence, we say, exceeds the judicial function just as much as, if after the case were in, he were to try to issue a pardon and his order is equally void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.405" offset="8772942">That fundamental division of power has been fully recognized, I think, in the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.329" offset="8808678">For example, in Ex parte United States, in 242 United States, the question was whether a District Court had the power to suspend sentence, the inherent power, because the case arose before the statutes conferred that power in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.867" offset="8882866">The decision upon mandamus was that the attempted exercise of such power was void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.410" offset="8913063">In the course of the reasoning by Chief Justice White, he expressed this fundamental division to which I've been trying to call attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.663" offset="8957994">He said “if it be that the plain legislative command fixing a specific punishment for crime is subject to be permanently set aside by an implied judicial power upon considerations extraneous to the legality of the conviction, it would seem necessarily to follow that it could likewise be implied a discretionary authority to permanently refuse to try a criminal charge because of the conclusion that a particular act made criminal by law ought not to be treated as criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.558" offset="9077635">And, thus, it would come to past that the possession by the Judicial Department of the power to permanently refuse to enforce a law would result in the destruction of conceded powers of other departments and, hence, leave no law to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.418" offset="9137089">So, he suggested the exercise that this power to decide what crime should be prosecuted simply did not belong to the Judicial Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.026" offset="9175437">The same point came before the Court, a number of years later, in Ex parte United States, in 287 United States, where a district judge had refused to issue a Bench warrant after the grand jury had returned a valid indictment and, thus, refused to bring the defendant to the Bar for trial and the Court held, again on mandamus, that that was an abuse by the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.147" offset="9295914">That it had no discretion to refuse to issue a Bench warrant because it would have no discretion to bar a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.608" offset="9329768">Thus, again indicating what the proper division of functions is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.202" offset="9352129">I think the case could be tested by an example which is not in the books, it seems to me, to follow from those precedence, just like today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.111" offset="9387865">Suppose that, as soon as the jury were empanelled in a criminal case, the judge should say, “I don't think this man should be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.610" offset="9425795">He's lived a reputable life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.307" offset="9436557">I doubt very much that he is guilty of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.124" offset="9447842">I, therefore, direct a verdict of acquittal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.683" offset="9462053">We submit that this simply would be a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.231" offset="9472293">The judge has no discretion to determine who should be tried and that the obvious flaw in that situation, the obvious excess of judicial power in that situation fully demonstrates that the petitioner's propositions are quite wrong in saying that anything called “an acquittal” is within the judge's power and puts an absolute end to any possibility of prosecution, except for the label which, surely, is not decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.535" offset="9613563">There's no difference between attempting to acquit a defendant before there's been any trial and refusing to issue a Bench warrant or refusing to let the grand jury return an indictment or entering a nolle pros over the objection of the United States Attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.737" offset="9874369">What we do say, Mr. Justice Harlan, is that the judge has power to acquit a defendant after he has heard the evidence, after he has granted a hearing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2501.903" offset="10110934">I was just going to say that there are a number of other points at which the power to direct an acquittal arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.905" offset="10150954">For example, the power to direct an acquittal because of a defect in the indictment which is unquestionably within the power of a district judge, it was the Wiseman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.121" offset="10203826">Even so, he shouldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.591" offset="10213752">He -- still, he has the power to do it and it is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.288" offset="10224515">That may, of course, be done at any stage of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.059" offset="10239561">Again, if the prosecution has made an opening statement which reveals what the testimony is and the judge says, “Well, all you propose to prove still wouldn't be a crime,” then, an acquittal may be entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.350" offset="10316779">Again, I think that, partway through the course of the case, the fundamental defect in the government's case may appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.164" offset="10356067">Let me suppose, for example, a prosecution for transmitting a stolen automobile across state lines, a violation of the Dyer Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.322" offset="10392639">Let us suppose that the -- in its opening statement, the United States Attorney said, “I'm, first, going to prove that this automobile was stolen and then, second, I'm going to prove how it was transported across state lines.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.605" offset="10441749">And, he calls a witness to testify that the automobile was stolen and the witness ends up with a self-contradictory evasive statement that maybe he gave to the defendant, and that's all that there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.530" offset="10493471">And, the judge says, “Well, that's the best you could do on this critical issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.466" offset="10513220">There's no point in our sitting here and trying whether it was taken across state lines.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.890" offset="10530983">But, the government had been given its chance to go forward on that aspect of the case and it failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.342" offset="10560763">Now, still, an additional illustration would be if a fundamental -- if some indisputable defense appeared in the course of the government's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.834" offset="10610709">At that stage, my point is that the judge must learn what the government can do and, if he doesn't learn what the government can do, then he is not exercising judicial power because the whole notion of the trial presupposes that what will act upon the basis of information before it and not, if he attempts to do something else, he is exercising this discretionary power, which I think the citation show does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.884" offset="10758875">Now, in this case, the trial had gone on for several days, but the judge's action did not differ in any substantial respect from the entry of a verdict of acquittal immediately after the jury was empanelled and before the opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.443" offset="10825122">The judge had been told that the prosecution would divide its case into two parts and it would only just barely embark upon the essential part of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.071" offset="10871620">Indeed, it seems to me that there can be no doubt that the jury could convict on whether the jury understood the witnesses about radiosondes or not or about these tests or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.376" offset="10920835">After all, if there were a number of witnesses who described this conspiracy and fixed the date, it wouldn't matter whether they understood the test, as long as they knew there was a conspiracy to falsify the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.517" offset="10977468">The witnesses on the conspiracy had simply not been heard with the exception of the testimony that Rosenholm had given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.829" offset="11026683">Here, again I think that, as a matter of fact, the careful opinion in the Circuit Court of Appeals describes the situation very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.510" offset="11061373">The district judge, Judge Woodbury, said sharply termi -- abruptly terminated the government's case long before the government had an opportunity to show whether or not it had a case and, moreover, he did so in ignorance of either the exact nature or cogency of the specific evidence of guilt, which government's counsel said he had available and was ready to present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.068" offset="11159594">We think it follows, therefore, that the order cannot possibly be sustained as an exercise of the power to acquit for insufficiency of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.279" offset="11200449">The Court lacked the power because it had not heard or even learned about the evidence and this depends, I emphasize again, not upon the chronological point of the trial or any mechanical measure but on whether the government has been given the substance of a hearing, either through the opportunity to paraphrase what the witnesses would say or through the opportunity to put the witnesses on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.293" offset="11312567">The alternative question, which is necessary for me to consider, is whether there is power to acquit because of a misconduct of the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.351" offset="11352795">I'll cover that very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.445" offset="11361155">A district judge has a wide variety of measures with which to deal with misconduct, may censure the attorney or take disciplinary action against him if it finds that the misconduct has somehow influenced the -- unfairly influenced the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.573" offset="11433671">Of course, it may declare a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.149" offset="11444015">If it finds that the government's conduct is so unfair that a fair trial could not be held in the district in the future, then, no doubt, it has authority to dismiss the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.300" offset="11496573">But, it has no power -- no more power to punish the prosecutors, I submit, by acquitting the defendant than there is to punish the defendant's lawyers by convicting the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.587" offset="11541713">As was stated in McGuire against the United States, a criminal prosecution is more than a game in which the government may be checkmated and the game lost merely because the officers have not played according to rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.553" offset="11601586">And, we conclude here that judge had done either possible basis, the order was a nullity.</text>

            <text syncTime="4066.049" offset="16367574">With respect to the defense of former jeopardy, Mr. Justice Black, I very briefly would say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.108" offset="16407803">In the first place, our Courts and, as Your Honor knows, from -- we'll recall from Wade and Hunter, in opinions by yourself, have rejected the notion that this is simply to be a mechanical counting of the number of times the defendant has been put before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.795" offset="16474572">And, there are many instances where some extraordinary event prevents a fair judgment of guilt or innocence, but that the defendant may be put on trial a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.430" offset="16545102">Those extraordinary events may be the death of the judge or the illness or death of a juror, the inability of the jury to agree, the fortunes of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.317" offset="16588675">Now, our case here really boils down to say that the assumption of this non-judicial power, or the attempt to exercise this non-judicial power on the part of the presiding judge, should be treated in the same way as other extraordinary non-judicial events such as the necessity of terminating a court-martial because of the fortunes of war or terminating a trial because of the illness of the judge or the illness of a juror.</text>

            <text syncTime="4594.051" offset="18479626">And, I think the reason why the issue is here today is the use of mandamus to raise the question when, admittedly, it could not be raised under the Criminal Appeals Act in a form of bootstraps argument, in effect, by using the Aldrich statute which never gave him the power to take this question up and there is no inherent right of appeal in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4618.713" offset="18578265">Well, there are two aspects of this mandamus problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.994" offset="18595297">If the government is right, if this was a lawless behavior and the consequence of the lawless behavior was a nullity, was a judicial nullity, was a legal nullity, then, certainly, mandamus would be an appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.136" offset="18659871">The other aspect of it is, if there's doubt about it, should mandamus be invoked?</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.962" offset="18679202">But, if the government is right, certainly, if there is a nullity and the record, he is acquitted of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.883" offset="18718908">And, the government goes in and says he shouldn't be acquitted of the law but he should be tried again and, in order to accomplish that conclusion, except by mandamus, just as Ex parte United States was by way of mandamus.</text>

            <text syncTime="4673.213" offset="18796231">I want to make this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.585" offset="18809710">The cases which the Solicitor General cited on issuing a bench warrant or enforcing a statutory sentence are compelling a judge to perform an act which he is supposed to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.808" offset="18878568">They do not involve the issue in this case where the judge has started the commencement of a hearing and has a power to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.749" offset="18930395">The Solicitor General directed himself to a division of powers argument between the executive and the judicial, and I would say that the argument is on the other foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.472" offset="18973236">It would appear to me that the Attorney General's Office is seeking to exercise judicial powers by stopping Judge Wyzanski from ent -- and any other District Court judge from entering a directed verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.606" offset="19033840">He made the determination that the prosecution's case was defective as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.401" offset="19056933">He didn't say that they should be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.808" offset="19066650">He didn't say they should be taken before a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.470" offset="19081279">He directed the verdict which is a judicial act directly within his powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.127" offset="19103848">He did it for reasons which were based on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.666" offset="19114088">He did it in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.249" offset="19120358">He believed it to be legally sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.512" offset="19129448">And, at that point, there should be no further examination of his action, particularly under the division of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.804" offset="19154631">Now, the absurdity of the government's argument is directed to the question which was raised by the Bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.519" offset="19181484">If acquittal is given before the government rests, then the Court of Appeals can review the record and that involves all the analysis of the motives that went into the judge in making the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.594" offset="19233729">If the acquittal is at the end of the government's case, it's final.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.263" offset="19252433">Now, this leaves open the whole area of the judge's right to exclude evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.319" offset="19280645">It narrows his discretion in a way that's never been narrowed in the history of the Federal Judiciary.</text>

            <text syncTime="4851.230" offset="19508328">In passing and in concluding, I should like to tell the Court that, as I listened to the learned Solicitor General's argument here today, I felt that this Court and we were faced with an argument not involving any defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.124" offset="19599862">It's as though there was an issue between the government and the District Court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.016" offset="19619401">Our system is key to dealing with the particular case and, in this case, we have defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="4889.688" offset="19662137">The government says they didn't have their day in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.689" offset="19674154">We say they had eight days in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.632" offset="19685857">The government says there was no hearing because the government's idea of the kind of evidence they should've listened to was not followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.159" offset="19723995">That, simply, is the government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.188" offset="19736116">Now, the Solicitor General very fairly made a statement that the trial was going well for these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.808" offset="19782614">How, on that basis, can this acquittal be tortured into a mistrial and these defendants be sent back for another trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.991" offset="19823365">What then does the Fifth Amendment mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.371" offset="19840815">I respectfully submit that, on any one of three alternative grounds, that mandamus is not a proper way to review this issue which is barred by the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.487" offset="19909360">That the District Court has inherent power, once the trial starts, to run that courtroom as he deems proper and that one of those powers is the direction of a verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.169" offset="19972054">It is one of the most important powers that he's got and it isn't for the prosecution to say “you can only do it when you listen to the amount of evidence that we want you to listen to or you sit here and make up your mind at the end of two witnesses and then turn off your hearing aid.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.192" offset="20048123">That part is alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.169" offset="20052093">The government would raise that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.011" offset="20059408">And, if we take the statement that Mr. Caner made during the nolle pros discussion that only one -tenth of the case was in, we might need another 80 days before the judge could turn off -- turn that hearing aid back on again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.046" offset="20119594">This is the absurdity to which this position leads us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.763" offset="20146448">And, lastly and most importantly, we only urge it because, under the rules of statutory construction, this Court often prefers to decide on questions other than constitutional questions, we know of no stronger case where individual defendants are entitled to the bar of double jeopardy than in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.855" offset="20238817">And, on all the applicable decisions of this Court, this writ of mandamus should be quashed and the order of the First Circuit reversed.</text>
