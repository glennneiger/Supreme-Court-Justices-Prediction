            <text syncTime="10.729" offset="146265">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.822" offset="162670">This appeal is from the dismissal of a corporate officer from the Sherman Act indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.786" offset="186493">The dismissed defendant Wise is Vice President and Director of the defendant, National Dairy's Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.403" offset="217004">He and his corporation were charged with conspiring with other persons to fix prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.758" offset="254412">Wise was the only individual defendant and was alleged to be actively engaged to manage with direction and control of national business.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.108" offset="295790">He was charged with having to authorize order conduct that implicated his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.306" offset="320554">The Justice Department has been prosecuting corporate officers, who are responsible for corporate Sherman Act violations under the Sherman Act for 70 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.805" offset="362559">But the District Court held in this case, this practice was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.407" offset="380949">From now on, the court below says, "Such officers can only be prosecuted under the Clayton Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="77.022" offset="411460">This holding rest primarily on a misconception as to what the Clayton Act was supposed to do, although that Act is described in its title as the supplement to the Sherman Act, the court held that Congress met instead to amend the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.479" offset="481259">In other words, what the Congress itself described, as an addition to existing to antitrust law liability was wrongly construed as replacing the existing liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.258" offset="536430">The history of the relevant legislation in a detailed analysis of the applicable case law is fully set out in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.485" offset="569344">All that I'm going to try to show here is that the practical effect of the decision is exactly contrary to what Congress intended when it passed the Clayton Act in 1914 and amended the Sherman Act in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.521" offset="641442">I propose to do this by first describing the pre-1914 practice in prosecuting corporate officers for Sherman Act violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.723" offset="682297">I shall then discuss the continuance of the same practice for the next 40 years with the implied approval of Congress and finally show an explicit approval of those practice in 1955 when Congress increased the maximum Sherman Act fine from $5000 to $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.907" offset="762964">Before 1914, 40 Sherman Act indictments have been returned against corporate officers or agents, 10 are which named only the individuals without making their corporations defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.382" offset="812910">The illegal conduct charge against these individuals have undertaken on behalf of their corporations but in no case was it essential to establish a violation by the corporation that already convicted the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.133" offset="867871">Although both were charged with the same Sherman Act offense, the liability of each was subsequently determined at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.416" offset="900995">Diverse in such indictments have been overruled on the ground to the corporate officer, who aids or abets this corporation in the commission of a misdemeanor, is just as guilty as this corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.789" offset="950523">That's a common law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.989" offset="959300">It was expressly applied to all federal crimes by the Aiders and Abettors Statute in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.367" offset="984795">Violations of the Sherman Act are almost had been misdemeanors.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.549" offset="1005589">These 40 indictments are identified in appendix A of our main brief and I'll only describe one here to illustrate the three Clayton Act practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.299" offset="1048534">This was the 1912 indictment of 30 officers and agents of the National Cash Register Company for conspiring to monopolize the cash register business for that corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.562" offset="1097644">In addition to its president, Patterson, and the principle sales officials, the indictment included 12 branch managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.257" offset="1128364">All were charged to interrupt the valid capacity and were convicted, 44 were sentenced to a year in jail of 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.636" offset="1165876">These convictions were on appeal during the entire debate on the bill that became the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.601" offset="1189804">And the Clayton Act debate leaves no doubt that the Congress unanimously favored continuance of Sherman Act prosecutions of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.511" offset="1225435">These debates showed --</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="288.016" offset="1255424">These debates show that both sides agreed that it was desirable to extend the criminal liability of corporate officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.064" offset="1283636">No one wanted to contract it.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.747" offset="1290324">No one advocated any repeal or restriction of their existing Sherman Act liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.372" offset="1316864">Section 14 was inserted in Clayton's Bill when that Bill's prohibitions against price discrimination, time clauses, stock acquisitions, and interlocking directorates for penal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.202" offset="1368168">That's the way it passed the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.747" offset="1378408">But the Senate made substantial changes at Section 14 lawsuits' original significance when the conference made the substantive provisions non-penal.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.988" offset="1427310">The final result was that Section 14 added nothing to the Clayton Act liability of the corporate officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.861" offset="1454791">It did add, however, to their Sherman Act liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.274" offset="1472449">But this add at Section 14 liability in contrast to the existing Sherman Act liability, was condition to file an antitrust law violation by the official's corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.455" offset="1521142">It was, therefore, less effective remedy than the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.441" offset="1537128">No officer could be convicted under Section 14 without a prior finding of a violation of Wise Corporation, no matter how flagrant the individual officers' old conduct might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.997" offset="1587388">This was understood by the Congress, and Judge Floyd charged the bill in the House and had to assure the House that Section 14 would not disturb the existing Sherman Act liability in order to get the conference bill passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.355" offset="1644753">If Section 14 had actually superseded the existing Sherman Act remedy, it would have repudiated instead of responded to President Wilson's request for greater antitrust penalties against the individuals responsible for corporate violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.954" offset="1715179">Wilson had told the Congress that the officers and directors of great business bodies, who were responsible for antitrust law violations, should themselves bear the stigma of these violations instead of their corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.386" offset="1772962">This could only be done by preserving the existing Sherman Act liability of those officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.807" offset="1798562">A Sherman Act indictment would permit conviction of the officials without a finding of violation by their corporation, a Section 14 indictment would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.607" offset="1849762">The Department of Justice, therefore, continued to prosecute corporate officers acting in the representative capacity under the Sherman Act, frequently, without naming their corporation as the defendant as in the Cash Register case.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.752" offset="1902425">There were no prosecutions under Section 14, and the Congress was kept fully advised as this is nonuse of Section 14 and the continued exclusive use of the Sherman Act in prosecuting corporate officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.627" offset="5025834">As I said, those things could only relegate determine in a Section 14 prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.566" offset="5049657">Clearly, I think that they aren't presented here, where the indictment is of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.149" offset="5083930">As I pointed out, in '55, when the penalty was -- was raised, there could no use at all of 14, Congress knew this, and it knew that the only -- only prosecutions of officers had been under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.373" offset="5144848">Now, when Congress first considered raising the antitrust law maximum fines in 1950, it was told by the Justice Department that no increase in -- no increase in the Section 14 fine was needed because this Section was unused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.869" offset="5234813">Congress accordingly limited the increase to the Sherman Act and all of the bills subsequently introduced for this purpose including the one that became law on the spring of 1955.</text>

            <text syncTime="1304.962" offset="5323212">That's explicitly pointed out both for me in the original brief and the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.963" offset="5343274">It was also told -- Congress has also told 1950 by the Justice Department that the proposed increase from $5000 to $50,000 was especially needed to deter corporate officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.549" offset="5393533">No one suggested that corporate officers ought to be exempted from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.309" offset="5412655">Now, the entire House debate on the 1955 Amendment took place on March 29th and takes up less than seven pages of the congressional record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.357" offset="5460825">The debate opened with the statement by representative Rogers at Colorado that the purpose of the increase was to give the court's discretion to make the punishment fit the crime for which the individual and I emphasize individual or the corporation, may have been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.574" offset="5537625">Congress went so and then inserted in the debate a tabulation of all convictions of imprisonment under the antitrust laws, down to February 15, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.633" offset="5589870">And that tabulation makes clear that the individuals under discussion included corporate officers acting in the representative capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.828" offset="5630725">Among the convicted individuals are listed to seven corporate officers in the Trenton Potteries case, all convicted for directing the price fixing activities of their corporation, who received jail sentences of from six to 10 months in 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.607" offset="5713795">And again, as in the 1914 Clayton Act debate, the only opposition to this Amendment was based on applying that the little legislations didn't make it fairly severe enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.894" offset="5770951">Now, when Congress, in 1955, deliberately declined to amend the unused Clayton Act provision and shows instead to amend the Sherman Act, that Amendment ought to be construed in accordance with that statute, the Sherman Act's prior actual used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.745" offset="5858304">So construed, the Sherman Act covered Wise's allege defense beyond any doubt and the dismissal of his indictment was plain error.</text>

            <label>Mr. John T. Chadwell</label>
            <text syncTime="1462.411" offset="5952972">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.939" offset="5983169">The indictment in this case against Mr. Wise, the Government does not deny and admits, is precisely in the language of Section 14 of the Clayton Act, reads right on it word per word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.861" offset="6054849">Now that Act, Section 14, imposes criminal liability upon corporate officers, directors, or agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.753" offset="6106363">In other words, it includes everyone who could possibly act for a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.965" offset="6131231">And it says, whenever, is the word whenever, anyone of these corporate officers, directors or agents shall have authorized order or done, authorized order or done any act constituting in whole or in part, in whole or in part, a corporate violation, the officer shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.509" offset="6273442">Now, Congress in that Act in 1914 encompassed every possible act by every possible corporate agent that could be done to effectuate a corporate violation in a whole or in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.980" offset="6347316">It would have been impossible for Congress to have passed the law which more completely encompassed the field of representative action on the part of a corporate employee or officer than they did when they adopted Section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.142" offset="6415966">Now, in spite of the fact that this statute clearly covers what Mr. Wise is alleged to have done, in spite of the fact that it comes precisely within Section 14, in spite of the fact that that statute provides for the maximum fine of $5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.632" offset="6493915">The bold proposition of the Government in this case is that the Department of Justices has the complete unreviewable discretion to decide and choose to prosecute this man under another statute, the Sherman Act, which makes no reference in terms whatsoever to any representative act by anybody which in nowhere and no place refers to any corporate officer, director or employee, and in spite of the fact that that statute contains a maximum fine of $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.490" offset="6653367">It is the position of the Government as annunciated by Mr. Wright today and over and over again in their brief, that they have this choice, it's not a judicial choice, it's up to them to decided whether they're going to prosecute in spite of the circumstances I have outlined under a statute that could cause a maximum of $5000 in fines or a maximum of $50,000 in fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.161" offset="6744064">Now, the -- the question in this case is whether or not under those circumstances, the Government is required to prosecute under Section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.364" offset="6808848">Now, the lower court held that the Government is so required to prosecute and four District Courts in different districts have sense agreed with the lower court in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.549" offset="6857540">Now, the Government's argument, if Your Honors please, the Government's argument comes down to this, "We have been using Section 1 to prosecute corporate officers and directors for 70 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.507" offset="6921383">No court ever held that we couldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.824" offset="6934653">It's now pretty late for a defendant to come into court when he's prosecuted under Section 1 and say, we -- I should have been prosecuted under Section 14 which carries a lesser fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.537" offset="6985540">And I say to this Court that the reason obviously, that this question was never raised before, is because until the difference in fines appeared at 1955, it was a completely academic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.762" offset="7050428">What difference did it make to when a defendant indicted under Section 1 whether in a corporate -- whether in a representative capacity or not, whether he should have been indicted under Section 14?</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.401" offset="7096926">The clients are very practical when they're in litigation, they're considering expense and time and everything else, why should they spend time and money litigating over whether Section 1 or Section 14 applied when there's no question that one did and when the fine was precisely the same in either event?</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.041" offset="7171532">Now, that's why it wasn't raised before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.721" offset="7182294">We have in this case, if Your Honors please, we have the situation that confronted this Court exactly in the Nashville Milk case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.692" offset="7218134">In that case, it had been assumed for a number of years since Section of 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act was adopted, it had been assumed that treble damage suits could be filed on the basis of Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.036" offset="7271528">It had been assumed indeed by this Court in the Bruce's Juices case and Moore against Mead that a treble damage suits would lie under Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.124" offset="7311862">The question as to whether or not Section 3 came within the antitrust laws so as to make it possible to sue -- to sue for treble damages was not raised directly on those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.552" offset="7357628">It was raised for the first time in the Nashville case and in the Nashville case, this Court held that you couldn't prosecute a treble damage suit under Section 3 because Section 3 wasn't a part of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.435" offset="7409142">And I say that the argument which the Government makes, trying to lift themselves by their own bootstraps in this thing saying, "That because we've made this mistake for 70 years, you can't challenge us now," makes no sense when the fines were different all this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.894" offset="7478941">Now, if the Court please --</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.325" offset="7520632">That contention is raised and I say to the -- to the Court and I -- and we've argued this and briefed it thoroughly, that Congress said, "No such thing," that Congress did not have the view that at anytime, that it was proper to prosecute corporate officers acting in a representative capacity under Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.826" offset="7634631">As a matter of fact, the -- the legislative history shows that from 1890, when the Sherman Act was passed, until 1914 when the Clayton Act was passed, there were 51, 51 different bills introduced in the Congress for the purpose of supplementing or amending the Sherman Act to cover corporate -- or representative liability by corporate officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.997" offset="7755316">One of them passed the House in 1900 and in the report of the judiciary committee to the House in support of that bill, the statement was made that the reason it was passed was because corporate officers or representatives, acting in a representative capacity, were not covered by the Sherman Act as it was -- as it then existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.745" offset="7846327">There was no question about it, if Your Honors please, on the basis of the corporate history here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.781" offset="7866493">I -- I strongly assert to the Court, there was no question that Congress never did a thing by virtue of these bills, these steady stream of bills over a period of 24 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.645" offset="7913932">They never did think that individual liability of persons acting in a corporate capacity was subject to the Sherman Act.</text>
