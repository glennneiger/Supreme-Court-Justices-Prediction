            <text syncTime="633.604" offset="2637824">Under those circumstances, this woman came to young, Mr. Trombley who was a member of the bar, not long but was a member of the bar, and asked his advice as to what she should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.196" offset="2684113">He said “tell the truth,” and so she then went back to Dr. Freeman and said that she understood she was going to be called as a witness in his hearing and she was going to tell the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.325" offset="2736671">Dr. Freeman said to her that he thought that would be unwise, and here is a significant shred of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.390" offset="2772929">He said “if you do testify, you may be put out of the house where you are living.”</text>
            <text syncTime="676.179" offset="2808038">This is what Mr. Trombley said that Mrs. Werheyki told him that “you may be put out of the Trombley house that your reputation will be ruined and other derogatory things will happen to you” and so, she came back and reported that to Mr. Trombley and his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.176" offset="2888077">It was in that context or atmosphere that, about two days later, this telephone call was received from Mr. Zipkin, the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.360" offset="2932799">Trombley testified and it was his testimony that was believed by the Bar Board, Trombley testified that this telephone call came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.745" offset="2974386">They had two extensions in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.562" offset="2981595">His wife first answered the phone and then he went over and picked up the telephone and it was Zipkin on the other end of the phone and he said “this is Michael Zipkin.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.018" offset="3027466">I am helping Dr. Freeman with his case and everything is getting along alright, except that we have one problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.504" offset="3065396">Irene Werheyki is in a truth-telling mood and I think that you and Mrs. Trombley and Dr. Freeman and I had better meet and discuss this subject to see what can be done about Irene.”</text>
            <text syncTime="757.375" offset="3132897">It's significant, too, that not just Mr. Trombley who was a young lawyer, and I think might have some special sensibilities about what should be done under those circumstances, he reacted violently, but so did his wife who was not a lawyer at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.878" offset="3194859">She said “we're not afraid of you, Zipkin.”</text>
            <text syncTime="775.690" offset="3206144">He said “are you trying to intimidate a witness?”</text>

            <text syncTime="818.771" offset="3378448">He denied that he said that Irene was in a truth-telling mood in this conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.279" offset="3400495">What he said that he said over the telephone was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.963" offset="3423274">That he called up saying that he had heard that Irene was going to charge Dr. Freeman in his hearing with rape or sexual relations with him and that he thought that the Trombleys should know that so they would not become involved in the mess that was sure to follow because she was living in their house.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.144" offset="3523897">That was what he said on one occasion, but when pressed further by the Board as to what he said over the telephone, he changed the story and said later “well, I called up and said that I had heard that Irene was going to testify in the Freeman hearing and that, if she does, you will become involved in the matter because she is living in your home.”</text>
            <text syncTime="883.500" offset="3637373">He denied that he was trying to intimidate a witness when he called but it is significant I think, too, that when Mr. Trombley and his wife both reacted violently to this telephone call, he said he didn't just stop, having given them the warning that he said he called up to give them, but he said “if you want to talk with me or with Dr. Freeman about this matter, if you will call me, I will tell you what I heard.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.060" offset="4319587">On page 87, about a-third of the way down, question, “alright, and you were calling the Trombleys, as I understand it, to inform them that Irene was going to testify to rape and sexual intercourse, although I also understand -- understood you to say you were confident in your own mind that Irene would do -- wouldn't do anything like that.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.454" offset="4589171">Did you testify to that or not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.761" offset="4598366">“Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.891" offset="4602964">Question, “didn't you just get through telling Mr. Syler, another board member, that you didn't know what she was going to testify to before you called Trombley?</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.949" offset="4643192">Which is right, did you or didn't you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.701" offset="4658134">Answer, “Here is what is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.240" offset="4668374">I called up the Trombleys and informed them of exactly what I heard.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.034" offset="4687496">“What did you hear?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.780" offset="4694497">Answer, “That Irene was going to testify against Freeman at his hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.913" offset="4714977">I didn't hear what about or what the charges were, I had no idea.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.160" offset="4740054">And this last, and then I will not burden you with further references to the record, one of the members of the Board, a Mr. Oliver, dissented from the finding of the Board but I think it is clear from the record that on the very concluding page of the examination of the petitioner, that Mr. Oliver thought that he had not testified candidly before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.126" offset="4847888">If Your Honors would turn to page 92 of the record, the very last thing that was asked the petitioner and this by Mr. Oliver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.573" offset="4893654">In the middle of the page and in the middle of his question, which is long, “I want you to reflect on what you had heard and what you actually told them as to your understanding to what Irene was going to testify to.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.042" offset="4959587">And then, answer, “I only told the Trombleys one thing,” and omitting a little, “I heard that Irene Werheyki -- I heard a rumor that Irene Werheyki was going to testify at this hearing of Dr. Freeman's.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.018" offset="5023431">“So that I understand your testimony, it is that you did not tell them -- tell that you had also heard that she was going to testify that she had been raped by Dr. Freeman or words to that effect?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.895" offset="5070973">“No sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.285" offset="5076511">And then, at the very end of the hearing, this comment by Commissioner Oliver, “well, I just wanted to be sure that you reflected on that because I am not quite sure the testimony is consistent all the way through” and so, if the Court please, it is our position here that there are two issues of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.269" offset="5192495">This Board had the power and the jurisdiction to determine facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.547" offset="5209527">It resolved both those facts against the petitioner, namely that he had testified falsely with reference to this telephone conversation and, second, that he had undertaken or attempted to intimidate a witness in the Freeman hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.390" offset="5292910">As a result of which, the Board concluded that the petitioner had not discharged his burden of proof to establish that he was of good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.984" offset="5335333">Now, the petitioner here has relied in its -- in his brief heavily upon the Schware and the First Konigsberg cases by this Court of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.961" offset="5391235">May I say that those cases are in no ways applicable to the present case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.059" offset="5411610">In the first place, this is not a First Amendment or Bill of Rights case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.335" offset="5436688">It is simply a question of whether this man had due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.651" offset="5458004">Is there any rational basis, in other words, for the finding of fact that was made by the Board in Missouri?</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.919" offset="5495097">Furthermore, these two cases, Schware and Konigsberg, are as different on the facts these cases could be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.274" offset="6484511">My feeling with reference to that is this, that the mere fact that the Board found that in an issue of fact with reference to whether he held himself out to be a lawyer in this other matter, the mere fact that the Board there found in favor of the petitioner, but found in another issue of fact with reference to intimidating a witness against him is by no means inconsistent and all that that illustrates really, if the Court please, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.270" offset="6616482">That a fact finding body whether it'd be a court or a board, such as this, that can see the witnesses, see their demeanor on the stand, how they react to questions that are put to them, has an immense advantage.</text>
