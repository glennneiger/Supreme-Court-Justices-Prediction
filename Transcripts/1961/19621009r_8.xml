            <text syncTime="7.967" offset="135189">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.439" offset="149086">At the time of adjournment yesterday, I was answering a question of Mr. Justice Goldberg with regard to the events on the occasion of the coroner's hearing of January 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.167" offset="200077">I was at the point of saying Mr. Justice Goldberg that with regard to the inquest into the death of Thompson when the deputy coroner asked the petitioner about this particular incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.712" offset="266219">He asked him where he was in the night in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.086" offset="283669">Townsend answered that he was in the vicinity of 35th in Giles in the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.896" offset="306970">Now, it happened that the coroner knew that the body of the decedent was found at 47th in Wabash and the coroner turned to the police officer and said, “You must have the wrong man.”</text>
            <text syncTime="64.700" offset="362141">At that point, the investigating officer turned to Townsend and all these facts are in the coroner's minutes now before the Court as part of their response to paragraph 18 of the petitioner's habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.212" offset="424208">The officer then turned to Townsend, began jogging his memory as to some conversation the officer had with Townsend prior to the inquest and I remind Your Honors that the origin of this dispute in the record arose because Townsend had said that what he had said in the coroner's hearing was what the officer had told him to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.427" offset="513128">When the interrogation continued, the deputy coroner turned to the officer and said, “Look, you must have the wrong man”.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.238" offset="560358">At that point, the officer said to the coroner, “Well, we can go out and get these guys.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.660" offset="594004">They have their patterns.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.351" offset="604766">Why shouldn't we get credit for these cleanups?”</text>
            <text syncTime="127.900" offset="615006">In other words, he was saying to the coroner that this being the first time we're here this year, we're cleaning up some unsolved murders of 1953 and this petition appears to be as good as an individual clean up the record with as anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.360" offset="672789">That's all part of the record now when Your Honors request the respondents to specifically answer paragraph 18 for petition for habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.845" offset="1330761">But in 1955 when this petitioner came to trial, the law was that he was not entitled to these copies of his confession and when he made the request by motion of his counsel, he was denied the copies of the confession so that if this motion had been granted, we don't know what defense counsel would have made of these confessions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.625" offset="7421889">As we have tried to marshal these vast expands of proceedings, it is our view that this controversy presents two basic issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.165" offset="7492002">The first I think is rather easy to phrase and that is whether or not Judge Igoe in the United States District Court abused his discretion when upon an independent examination and investigation of the record in the Supreme Court of Illinois, he was satisfied that this petitioner was accorded due process and dismissed the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.345" offset="7596701">The second one is much more difficult to phrase and that's the one that has caused the problem particularly today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.415" offset="7637034">As I read the petitioner's briefs, as I distill his arguments, his claim appears to be that a drug induced confession is violated of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.939" offset="7707146">If that would be the issue then I would not be standing here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.473" offset="7737240">The issue in this case is whether this confession was drug induced and nowhere, nowhere that we had any demonstration at all from this petitioner that this confession and the amount of drugs employed here could have possibly in any way at all, could it possibly created such a situation in his personality as to induce a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.823" offset="7850715">Before I examine these two basic propositions, I would like to make one remark by way of preface.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.712" offset="7882271">As this Court well knows, the final judgment in this proceeding was handed down in April of 1955 in the Criminal Court of Cook County.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.266" offset="8344430">This case presents a problem as far as federal habeas corpus is concerned and I would like, if I could to speak, as a lawyer rather than as an advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.138" offset="8411930">And I would like to report an incident that I heard several years ago which is quite applicable that during a course of a television interview of a counsel or attorney from the foreign service of England, where he was interviewed in the Chicago station about three or four days after another internationally famous death case in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.490" offset="8525302">And while this gentleman was discussing the pre-criminal procedures in England, he made one observation which didn't strike me until I realize of the man not our own, the man of the English bar had mentioned it to us and that was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.984" offset="8599280">He appreciated the concept of dualism of sovereignty that we have in this country, the several individual 50 states and the national federal state that we have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2153.987" offset="8719339">And I, as a lawyer, think it's one of the finest inventions that's ever been made in the field of jurisprudence, but I think we must always remember that up until, I believe it was 1867, it was impossible to review a state court conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.299" offset="8772524">It was not until the enactment of the Federal Habeas Corpus Act that this could be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2218.673" offset="8978056">Now, I address myself with the first proposition sir and that is whether or not Judge Igoe abused his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.166" offset="9015986">During the course of the last argument which is held in February of this year and once again during the course of this argument, questions have been propounded by several members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.456" offset="9073246">Counsel, what did you want to put in?</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.537" offset="9097488">And for some reason or other, the petitioner and his counsel just have not been able to tell the Court precisely what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.883" offset="9138866">This federal habeas corpus proceeding began in December 1958 before Judge Igoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.659" offset="9170004">It began before Jennings v. Ragan and up until Jennings v. Ragan, it was a practice and what everybody thought was the approved practice in the Northern District of Illinois to judge or to apply the Brown versus Allen criterion from the opinion of the highest court of the state and not the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.520" offset="9269478">The state office petitioned on that basis and counsel for petitioner in addressing Judge Igoe during that proceeding and that transcript is a part of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.724" offset="9326320">As a matter of fact, it is found on page 26 of the transcript, December 15, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.449" offset="9361220">And this is counsel speaking and quote, “I agree with Your Honor that the cases on this subject hold that Your Honor need not conduct a hearing in the sense of witnesses being called.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.728" offset="9422242">I agree with Your Honor that we could submit to you for an example and I could make it available to Your Honor quite promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.365" offset="9456828">I could make available to you the court reporter's notes, transcript of the hearing in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.801" offset="9482533">I could present that to you, it won't take me long,” in December 1945, as I said, before Judge Igoe pursued the practice prior to Jennings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.300" offset="9544600">In the meantime, Jennings was decided on petition writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.975" offset="9567274">This Court vacated the orders of the lower court citing Jennings v. Ragan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.255" offset="9604368">Now, counsel during yesterday's argument made some suggestions that some mandate came down to Igoe as to what he should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.412" offset="9661001">As I read that brief, minute order, there was no secret or implied mandate contained therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.074" offset="9695692">It was an order of this Court when they cite Jennings and it's quite obvious to everybody that to practice now is in applying the Brown versus Allen standard, in attempting to ascertain whether or not there was a vital flaw in a state court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.035" offset="9763506">The District Court judge no longer can rely upon the opinion alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.351" offset="9780746">He must go to that record and that is the practice now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.956" offset="9799241">And that record came up and Judge Igoe on the 12th of June took that record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2460.535" offset="9945527">Your Honor, as we read Brown versus Allen, Brown versus Allen is an opinion of caution, of caution to the trial judges admonishing them that it is only in the extraordinary cases that the federal court will end the theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.015" offset="10043434">In line with your question sir, I suggest and I urge that it should be proper practice that before any witness be called that the state be entitled to know whether it can rely upon that record and I think the determination as to whether there is a vital flow in that record or not should be made before anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.946" offset="10151163">I'll tell you what happened to me in the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.615" offset="10173837">I filed my answer and set this up to Brown versus Allen defense up as the first affirmative defense and I requested the ruling on that defense before we go any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.032" offset="10219499">The District Court judge took it under advisory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.955" offset="10239143">Now, I have a problem in Illinois because in Illinois in confession matters, as a matter of decisional law, any law enforcement officer who was in any way associated with the defendant during this investigative process out of which a confession arises must be called.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.324" offset="10328691">In other words, the state cannot choose say five out of 14 and say we'll go with five witnesses and prove up the voluntary nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.870" offset="10366830">You've got to call all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.685" offset="10374144">And if you don't, reverse and remanded for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.264" offset="10396400">I'm in the Federal District Court, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.071" offset="10407685">My only defense, I'm notified within 48 hours with the state court record and I don't know whether I can rely upon that state court record and we were put to the test as far as evidence is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.748" offset="10458363">So I was forced to gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.225" offset="10468289">I was forced to gamble and say, “I will go with the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.926" offset="10483127">I will not examine that record and choose my witnesses because certainly, I won't call all of them in the federal court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.011" offset="10511444">So I respectfully suggest Your Honors, if this question should in any way at all come up during the course of the discussion in this case, I think that it is sound practice consistent with the spirit of federal habeas corpus as announced by this Court in Brown versus Allen and it is orderly practice that before any evidence be given, the state have a determination from the District Court that he is -- the district judge is either satisfied or he is dissatisfied with the state court record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.164" offset="10668074">And if he is dissatisfied then we know where we stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="4225.932" offset="17007052">In the first place, when this petitioner prosecuted its appeal in the Supreme Court of Illinois, no argument was made that the drugs were involuntarily administered or without his consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.375" offset="17072880">No question was raised as to the purpose for which the drugs were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.930" offset="17103078">He filed this petition writ of certiorari from the judgment of affirmance and that was done in August 3, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.858" offset="17150830">Now, during the course of that petition, the petitioner wrote that the drug used is known under two names, namely, hyoscine and scopolamine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.111" offset="17199835">And the petitioner further declared to this Court and I quote, “that the drugs were administered to petitioner with his consent and with the avowed intention on the part of the police surgeon to alleviate the heroin withdrawal symptoms.</text>

            <text syncTime="4326.710" offset="17410173">And what was the gist of that post-conviction hearing?</text>

            <text syncTime="4613.361" offset="18556844">We have examined and reviewed the same authorities in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.900" offset="18574921">And this 1/230 for the grain is approximately 0.27 milligram of scopolamine and the normal therapeutic dose as reported by petitioners own authority is 0.5 milligram.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.810" offset="18638660">During the course of number of questions here and I believe it was yesterday afternoon, counsel stated flatly that he was not making any claim of incompetency of trial counsel but did suggest that perhaps trial counsel was not as well equipped as he should have been to conduct the examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.425" offset="18745031">Well we disagree and disagreed most heartedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.312" offset="18756629">I think if you'll examine the cross-examination of Dr. Mansfield, the cross-examination of Dr. Hoffman as well as the direct examination of Dr. Proctor, you'll find that John Branion -- Mr. Branion was thoroughly familiar with the properties of the drug.</text>

            <text syncTime="4723.214" offset="18996224">And this is very significant because this use of drug in the field of narco-analysis and narco-interrogation began in obstetrics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.392" offset="19044916">It began in the early 1900s and the doctor from Texas came upon a flight suddenly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.931" offset="19087130">The twilight sleep was developed during the early 1900s and a man by the name of Dr. Gauss, G-A-U-S-S is actually the man who developed the technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.953" offset="19155153">And Dr. Gauss' formula in order to induce twilight sleep was 1/6 grain of morphine plus 1/140 grain of scopolamine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.158" offset="19220041">Now, that's 1/140 of grain scopolamine is more of course than 1/230 of the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.235" offset="19256299">Three quarts of an hour later, 1/140 of grain is administered again, scopolamine alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.229" offset="19300289">And a half hour later, the memory tester began.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.223" offset="19316276">In other words, the time of the first injection, they say a cup was shown to the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.545" offset="19341563">Then you come back and show the person the cup and if they still remember the cup, that means that the degree of anesthesia, and that is what narco-analysis and narco-interrogation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.409" offset="19392972">That's an anesthetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.070" offset="19403630">When you read the scientific journal, they speak of dissenting to level to bring him down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.995" offset="19427349">The degree of anesthesia is not high enough so they keep administering the drug until they reach that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.298" offset="19460577">In 1916, a man by the name of Dr. House doing some obstetric work in Ferris, Texas; it was during the course of delivery and he had a woman, mother, prospective mother under twilight sleep.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.363" offset="19532779">He was talking to her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.057" offset="19543646">And he asked her the questions -- asked him the questions and he answered them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.420" offset="19569037">He answered them truthfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.785" offset="19578546">But the point is that when she came out, she had total amnesia for the incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.900" offset="19606967">She didn't remember it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.109" offset="19615848">But immediately Dr. Ferris felt that he had something in the field of -- I don't want to call it psychiatry because in those days, psychiatry was not -- it was just pioneering.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.341" offset="19660779">He felt that something could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.406" offset="19673004">The newspapers hit upon it and we had the famous phrase “truth serum”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.785" offset="19694529">Of course all your scientific man, even to this day throw their hands up at the term or phrase “truth serum”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.727" offset="19730265">One school did take it on and that was the School of Crime Detect -- Crime Detection Laboratory which was attached to the Northwestern University Law School.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.368" offset="19784808">We have there a man by the name of Goddard who led that group.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.411" offset="19797034">He was associated and assisted by Muehlberger and Keeler.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.002" offset="19819395">And Keeler later ran a crime detection lab and they used this technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.098" offset="19843741">They used it on 25 volunteers and he made a study of it which is reported in 1932 I believe in Hygeia and his recommendation was that in order to use scopolamine for purposes of narco-analysis or narco-interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.927" offset="19923048">This is the method.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.758" offset="19930363">Your initial injection 1/100 of a grain hypodermically and then you have additional hypodermical or hypodermic injections of 1/200 of a grain every 20 minutes for an average of three to six injections until the subject reaches the proper stages of their interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.566" offset="20041644">The important thing to remember that under this system, it is given on an anesthesiologist and the time element is anywhere from an hour and a half to three hours and you have an average here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.339" offset="20144776">I withdraw that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.967" offset="20147284">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.996" offset="20155329">And your initial injection of 1/100 is actually more than twice that was administered here on the first of January and then for three to six additional injections, you have 1/200 of a grain which continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.411" offset="20221053">If you total this out gentlemen you have an average here of 10 times the amount, 10 times the amount that was administered to this particular individual in order to achieve any kind of narco-analysis which is necessary in order to induce a confession such as is claimed by the petitioner in this particular incidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="5082.737" offset="20434317">A very common use is the preparation for anesthesia, preanesthesia; the reason being that it contracts the Salisbury muscle that maintains dryness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.484" offset="20489279">It is used in the field of ophthalmology to produce psychoplegia.</text>

            <text syncTime="5123.847" offset="20598784">And the amount of dose that was given was three-tenths of a milligram and study shows that it was given without any impairment of military efficiency.</text>

            <text syncTime="5137.308" offset="20652596">You not only have a man flying a plane, this is war time activity because after all, the airplane during war time is secondary.</text>

            <text syncTime="5277.603" offset="21213811">Now, much has been said here, cases tried defended on the theory that amnesia had developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.746" offset="21266369">Now, the key to this treatment that uses scopolamine narco-analysis is amnesia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.895" offset="21295000">If you read the petitioner's testimony, it's indeed significant that he remembers the favorable items but forgets the unfavorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.759" offset="21342438">And there is no record or no history of the partial amnesia in this type of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.318" offset="21368665">In this trial, namely the Boone trial, he says he did not remember the Assistant State's Attorney taking the statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="5505.459" offset="22125171">Gentlemen, basically that is the decisive question in this case because if this Court is to give this petitioner the relief that he asks for, he must of necessity ask this Court to substitute his judgment for that of the trial judge who saw the witnesses on the preliminary of the jury who saw the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.370" offset="22236871">And he must ask this Court to ascribe more credibility to Dr. Proctor his expert as against Dr. Mansfield and Dr. Hoffman, and incidentally in the Court of Appeals in his own brief he conceded that Dr. Mansfield was entitled to be accorded more weight for the testimony was entitled to be accorded more weight than that of Dr. Proctor.</text>

            <text syncTime="5731.186" offset="23028067">Thank you very much for the suggestion because I recall the question by Mr. Justice Brennan yesterday as to whether those are before the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.304" offset="23060564">Of course, the easiest way to find out whether they're before the trial court is to look at the record from the Supreme Court of Illinois, you'll find it's not in there and it's true that Judge Butler did make some inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.890" offset="23106957">But he had to make the inquiry to rule on the objection and the best that Judge Butler did find out was that there were other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.737" offset="23142275">But Judge Butler this day on the basis of this record, doesn't know what those crimes were and neither did the Supreme Court of Illinois because the petitioner kept them out and he kept them out in the grounds where they're highly prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5777.093" offset="23211760">Now, they are the Stinson, the Thompson and the Johnson item.</text>
            <text syncTime="5786.881" offset="23250944">Johnson is a gentleman that was coming home and stopped at the local pub and it was late in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="5794.592" offset="23281768">And he was hit -- as I read the medical history about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.952" offset="23299218">He did not die immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.656" offset="23309981">And during the course of -- certain statement is made, he characterized his difficulty as a result of an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.686" offset="23354075">It is true that during the course of the interrogation on January 1, 1954, the petitioner did confess to the Johnson murder of the Johnson assault which later resulted in murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5829.143" offset="23419904">Now, the petitioner is trying to develop now the idea that there was no murder because the man said, it was an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="5839.496" offset="23461386">Well, I said the last time and I say once again, judging the course of the thrust of the blow and it was in the evening as I recall it, how does he know what hit him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5855.371" offset="23524812">You're walking alone the street that could happen to anybody and Mr. Johnson would not be the first case of a man who was struck in the head and felt that was a result of an accident and later was found to be the result of a murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.779" offset="23590536">As far as the Thompson case is concerned, that's the one where he didn't remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.363" offset="23628779">And I believe that's the case where the hassle developed between Officer Cagney and the deputy coroner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5890.876" offset="23666918">And the hassle developed precisely over this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.631" offset="23677889">The deputy coroner had suggested that the officer go out and get some more information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5901.768" offset="23710490">Well, these were December 1958 assaults and murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.730" offset="23734314">I think it appears in the record certainly in the coroner's inquest that Officer Cagney had been working since that time and he felt as though that he had made the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.293" offset="23800560">And it's over this remark about his going on to get some more dope -- dope by mean information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5933.340" offset="23836714">That was the language that was used that Officer Cagney became quite excited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5941.319" offset="23868688">Now, it's true that the petitioner was not represented by a counsel here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5945.969" offset="23887287">Under the Illinois law, the purpose and that's primary the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5951.466" offset="23909230">The purpose of an inquest to determine the cause of death and if there'd be a felonious death, the statute requires that person who is suspected of causing it be held over the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.635" offset="23949876">That's the very limited power with -- of an Illinois coroner's inquest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.735" offset="23970356">His sister was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5968.923" offset="23979029">A point was made yesterday about his reluctance to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.562" offset="24001599">He was warned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5975.740" offset="24006301">Now if you read the inquest, there's a pattern there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.812" offset="24018631">When they said, “Do you want to testify?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5980.823" offset="24026676">He either stood mute and I believe -- or I think he stood mute both times or shook his head no.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.689" offset="24050082">Then he asked, “Do you want to tell the story?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5988.666" offset="24058023">The answer was “yes”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5991.564" offset="24069622">Now, the Stinson, I don't know what happened in the Stinson case and if you look at the case on the evidence and you think the state would never have any trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="6007.378" offset="24132838">The man stole the shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6008.972" offset="24139212">He stole the overcoat.</text>
            <text syncTime="6010.319" offset="24144645">He stole the watch.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.110" offset="24151855">By the man I'm talking about the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6015.639" offset="24165961">They have the man to whom he sold the -- to whom he gave the shoes and they also have the man to whom he sold the watch and he's also -- he gave the coat.</text>
            <text syncTime="6028.120" offset="24215803">They go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6029.596" offset="24221759">They go to a jury with the finding of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6035.305" offset="24244642">I appreciate counsel's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.176" offset="24256031">I mean he wants to ascribe some degree of infallibility to that particular jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6042.371" offset="24272854">He was able to look into Townsend's mind and say that confession was not voluntary therefore, none of them are voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6050.387" offset="24304933">The best that I can say Mr. Chief Justice on that is that, to me, it establishes one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6055.916" offset="24327084">I've mentioned it before and I think it's worth mentioning again that even in Cook County, Illinois, if for some reason or other in what the reason is here but even in Cook County, Illinois, a jury has some doubt regardless of how heinous the crime, they'll come back with the verdict of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.807" offset="24422588">And I think when you examine that in this proper perspective, it points out that there is fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6088.667" offset="24458010">And that we do not have a climate of sequestering and enforcing people in this situation such as it's been implied here in one remark or another.</text>

            <text syncTime="6512.547" offset="26153566">If you look in the report of proceedings of June 12, 1959 on page 61 of the report of proceeding, I asked Judge Igoe for a full plenary hearing with the opportunity to present evidence, point three of the petitioner's brief before Judge Igoe prayed for an opportunity to be heard and Judge Igoe denied that opportunity by his memorandum order of June 24, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="6542.680" offset="26274043">Now, Your Honor, I would like to have you accept my answer since Mr. Hladis wasn't there.</text>

            <text syncTime="6559.820" offset="26342693">Yes, page 61 and if you look -- if Your Honor will please look at my brief before Judge Igoe, point three, I asked him for a hearing and urged it because I wanted an opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6571.956" offset="26391176">In fact, I even went out with some rather language that at least when the man is executed, when he is taken to his grave, we can all be satisfied, he had a final consideration of his question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6581.642" offset="26429942">And Judge Igoe denied that opportunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="6587.625" offset="26453870">Judge Igoe ruled on the respondent's motion to dismiss in effect and held that he was satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6593.192" offset="26476126">In other words, he took the court records.</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.667" offset="26490023">And to answer Mr. Justice Clark's question with regard to the confessions, I did represent this petitioner in the post-conviction petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="6612.949" offset="26555120">On a motion to dismiss, all that was done was the petition was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6617.105" offset="26571839">I made reference of these confessions, asking for the same opportunity before Judge Butler.</text>
            <text syncTime="6621.828" offset="26590647">I thought if Judge Butler had given me the opportunity to be heard, he might have been persuaded with the fact which Mr. Hladis has not answered Your Honor's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6629.978" offset="26623248">He didn't' tell you about Gus Anagnost, saying that X had assaulted him with a brick and then a moment later, they have taken a confession from Townsend after this drug injection that he had robbed Gus Anagnost.</text>
            <text syncTime="6641.968" offset="26671208">You see, I was hoping that if I could ever get a judge, a trial judge, to listen to me, to hear this evidence, he might be persuaded all these confessions were like Stinson was.</text>
