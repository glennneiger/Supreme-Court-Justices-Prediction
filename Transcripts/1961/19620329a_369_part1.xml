            <text syncTime="44.284" offset="280534">In the midst of a local political campaign, the judge of the Superior Court of Bibb County, on behalf of all three judges of that court, delivered a special charge to a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.953" offset="351169">Before delivering that special charge, the local press had been notified to have reporters present.</text>

            <text syncTime="75.080" offset="403728">In that charge, the judge, after advising the grand jury, he was speaking on behalf of all three judges, said among other things, “we find what appears to be an inane and inexplicable pattern of Negro bloc voting.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Milton Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="145.350" offset="684805">At the top of the page, he advised the grand jury “bloc voting is apparent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="151.425" offset="709047">Then, the last sentence of that paragraph ending on that page, “we do not mean to say to you that Negros do not have the vote -- the right to bloc vote, if they wish to do so if their self-interest is a factor in their decision,” presumably, otherwise, they have no such right in the view of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.058" offset="787623">The next paragraph, “issues, principles, or policies may under some circumstances, justify certain groups in casting similar votes, but if the vote is a right, it is an individual right and carries with it the duty and obligation of intelligent determination by the individual claiming the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.527" offset="865468">There is no right of a vote to be bartered, nor is there any right to a vote to be cast in bloc.”</text>
            <text syncTime="198.801" offset="898591">Now, at the bottom of the page, “there is no doubt that when the vast majority blindly follow the leaders and vote as they are told, it actually amounts to a purchase of thousands of votes by the favorite candidate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="214.113" offset="959822">Now, over on page 10, after instructing the grand jury on the existence of certain election laws which had not been enforced for over 50 years, they had a law on the books at that time which made it illegal to pay anybody to campaign for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.779" offset="1030457">All campaigning had to be by volunteer, but that had been ignored for 50 years and he refers to that on page 10, the first paragraph starting that page, “some may say that the hiring of people for the purpose of canvassing and influencing voters to vote for one candidate rather than another is a common practice in elections and, therefore, should be overlooked,” but he tells them not to overlook it in the case of Negro bloc voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.406" offset="1141008">On page 11, in the third paragraph, “it is not unusual to hear a candidate proclaim that there are no racial issues involved and that he represents no special interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.153" offset="1188028">That he is beholden to no particular individual or group and yet we find on election day getting an almost solid Negro bloc vote and no satisfactory explanation is ever offered.”</text>
            <text syncTime="284.218" offset="1240273">That was on June the 6th.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.683" offset="1254066">After he delivered his charge, copies of his charge were available for distribution in the judge's chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.446" offset="1297115">The next day, the petitioner in this case, who also was the Sheriff of the County, issued a news release, and that appears on page 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.731" offset="1350301">In that, he said among the following, and this was the basis for his first citation --</text>

            <text syncTime="430.553" offset="1825625">Whatever the judge's intention, the action of the Superior Court judges ordering a Bibb County grand jury to investigate Negro bloc voting “will be considered one of the most deplorable examples of race agitation to come out of the middle Georgia in recent years,” and skipping down to the paragraph after the next, “no one would question the duty of a grand jury to investigate any at all election law violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.675" offset="8798124">The legal argument is really very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.057" offset="8807633">I -- the court below held that a conduct that has a tendency to obstruct or, in another place, condunce -- conduct that could have had the effect of diverting the grand jury is enough to constitute contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.250" offset="8864371">Now, Bridges against California, Pennekamp against Florida and Craig against Harney are all clearly to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.212" offset="8896240">I might point out that the dissent in Pennekamp against Florida was predicated primarily on the fact that there was an attempt at intimidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.687" offset="8938141">Now, we have nothing here about the petitioner who was held in contempt trying to intimidate anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.655" offset="8961964">He was simply criticizing someone else's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.462" offset="8977220">Also in the Pennekamp and the Craig against Harney cases, this Court held that it examines the facts for itself to determine whether there is a clear and present danger which must be shown and, I'm sure you've heard the words many times, solid evidence and that the effect must be a very serious one and something more than probable must be very imminent and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.132" offset="9083904">This case meets none of those tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.578" offset="9097697">I said the dissent and two of them, or at least one of them was predicated primarily on intimidation and we have no intimation of intimidation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.224" offset="9148270">What we have here is an admitted attempt to dust off a law that hadn't been enforced for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.438" offset="9173138">The judge, himself in his charge, recognized that that this law hadn't been enforced for a great many years and he was asking the jury to consider enforcing it against the Negroes and, the petitioner said he thought it was unfair for the judge to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.191" offset="9244087">The other thing he did was to say that if bloc voting is investigated, investigate it all over not just by Negroes and he said further that if the judge's charge being limited to Negroes would be construed as intimidation and all his criticism was of the judge, not of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.972" offset="9339277">In the Pennekamp case, the Court indicated, it didn't hold, that criticism of a judge in a case that was going to a petit jury there would have too speculative effect to warrant, holding it to be in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.141" offset="9435930">Now, I'd like to mention another consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.159" offset="9452022">In Craig against Harney, both the majority opinion and the dissent of Mr. Justice Jackson indicated that they were of the view that the range of permissible comment about judicial proceedings would be greater in a case where public issues were involved than it would be in the ordinary private litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.335" offset="9560691">Now, this Court has held that, it has indicated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.303" offset="9572603">Now, if that is the consideration then, certainly, it would strengthen the position of the petitioner here because this charge to the grand jury was obviously a matter of great public importance and of public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.764" offset="9642402">I submit, you need not decide that here because even if the range of the permissible conduct for that were narrower, it would still not be contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2732.254" offset="11032430">They say truth is an affirmative defense in Georgia which must be raised and untruth need not be alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.643" offset="11065971">Now, as I've shown, it was raised, but their citations in support of the proposition that truth is an affirmative defense and must be raised are such things as, well, in one place here, “Section 105708,” which we cite is relevant to that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.180" offset="11148100">105707 provides that if a White woman is charged with having had sexual intercourse with a colored man, that should be slander without proof of damage and then 708 says that truth could be a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.037" offset="11207555">Now, what relevance that has to a case like this is beyond my comprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.739" offset="11226363">The other citations in support of that proposition are similar.</text>

            <text syncTime="3565.234" offset="14364296">Sometimes, so the court stated, this money was paid ostensibly for advertising in radio or published and so forth but that it appeared that it was in fact understood by the parties to be an outright purchase of the votes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4616.138" offset="18567920">We feel that there are two questions and two questions only that are really presented by this petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.410" offset="18592998">The first one is what was the test applied by the Court of Appeals in evaluating these statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.575" offset="18613687">The second question is, assuming that this test was clear and present danger, as we contend, was the test properly applied?</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.415" offset="18645034">Now, there is a third issue that the petitioner seeks to make here which we will show was not raised in the trial court, in the Court of Appeals, in the Supreme Court of Georgia or in the petition for certiorari filed in this Court, and that relates to his contention that he was deprived of the opportunity of proving truth as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.122" offset="18727894">Eight years prior to this Court's 1944 decision in the Bridges case, the Court of Appeals of Georgia had rejected the common law scandalizing the court test in Townsend versus State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.488" offset="18777318">And, what has become to be the leading case in Georgia on constructive contempt, the McGill case, cited in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.046" offset="18811591">The Court declared that the common law rule was no longer in effect in Georgia by virtue of the constitutional guarantees of speech and press.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.493" offset="18845341">The Court in this case declared that while the power to punish for contempt was inherent in courts of record, that this inherent power itself was limited by the constitutional provisions or freedom of speech and of the press.</text>

            <text syncTime="4788.364" offset="19256822">In the present case, the amended petition for contempt allege that petitioner's statements were issued while the grand jury deliberation was in progress and that they constituted a clear, present, and imminent danger to the investigation and administration of justice, page 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.702" offset="19318157">Throughout the proceedings in the trial court and in the Court of Appeals, emphasis was placed on the fact that this was an interference, an obstruction with a pending grand jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.977" offset="19363297">The opinion of the Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to petitioner's statements as being contemptuous because of the obstruction and interference with the pending proceeding, and the court specifically held that the evidence on both counts supports the finding clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.767" offset="19422438">A compelling significance, as I have just stated, is the fact that in reversing on count 2, the Court of Appeals assigned as its reason the fact that it did not meet the test of clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.680" offset="19466115">Now petitioner's argument that clear and present danger was not used is based entirely upon some statements taken from Carr versus State which counsel for the petitioner has already conceded, were misquoted in his brief.</text>
