            <label>Mr. John Cardinal</label>
            <text syncTime="13.528" offset="157445">Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.649" offset="182000">This case was argued on the general docket in the Spring that if I might, I would like to go through the facts briefly once again.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.985" offset="227349">As you may recall it's an indictment and conviction for the violation of Title 18, 1505 of the US Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.469" offset="269249">The facts which led up to the indictment of the petitioner are briefly and they begin with the filing or the serving of a petition purportedly that of the McClellan Committee on the petitioner on March 21, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.216" offset="356185">The subpoena -- I'm sorry, I might have said the petition, it was the subpoena that was served on Mr. Presser, called for the all of the records of Joint Council 41 which is the -- an affiliation of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters for the northeastern and southeastern parts of Ohio, for a period of approximately 10 years from July -- from January 1, 1959 until January 1, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.340" offset="508740">Immediately following the service of this subpoena upon Mr. Presser, it was affected with the Committee's field office in Cleveland an arrangement whereby the accountants and attorneys for Joint Council 41 gave to the field office personnel, those records demanded by the subpoena and for which the field office receipted.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.621" offset="641860">This arrangement continued until at least September 5 of 1958 at which time Sheridan who had served the subpoena on Mr. Presser, again returned to Cleveland and served a subpoena upon Koza and Stoyer, the accountants and lawyers for Joint Council 45, demanding that the office files of that firm as they pertain to Joint Council 41 were to be displayed in Washington on September 9, five-four days from that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.018" offset="811447">On September 9, Sheridan again returned to Cleveland and went to the office of Joint Council 41 where he testified that in as much as he was aware that some of the files had not been turned over to the field office, he attempted to examine those files still in Joint Council 41's office to determine whether or not they should have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.404" offset="932968">After some conversation with Mr. Presser, the files -- the cabinets in the office were turned over to Mr. Sheridan and he examined those for a considerable period of time and determined that he would take four particular files.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.397" offset="1004962">In one of these files, there were, according to his testimony, two documents, one an invoice known as the Doich invoice and its ex -- the Government's Exhibit 12 upon which there were listed eight names.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.834" offset="1082702">The invoice was the counsel's receipt for the purchase of eight champagne buckets.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.485" offset="1121364">On the other document, was a list of names which included the eight on the Doich invoice but other names behind which were listed certain items known to the investigator to have been sums of money for or gifts, Christmas gifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.366" offset="1204851">These were contained in an envelope marked X-mas list.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.058" offset="1231600">Mr. Presser testified that he wanted a receipt for the four files that were taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.417" offset="1261066">Because of the lateness of the hour, Mr. Sheridan said I can't do that, I will be back and they by mutual agreement, agreed to have the files photostated and Sheridan was to return on the 13 and pick up the photostated copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.626" offset="1333896">Mr. Sheridan's testimony was that there was no testimony -- no conversation concerning a receipt that Mr. Presser said that he would not let them go out until they were photostated.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.674" offset="1378095">At any way, on the 13th of September, Sheridan again returned the office and Joint Council 41, look through the files, and found that the Doich invoice had been mutilated to exclude the eight names listed on the left-hand corner and the list which include those eight names and others, was missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.357" offset="1492825">He immediately made some remark to Mr. Presser and Presser was too have said, “You have your job to do, I have mine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="355.242" offset="1524381">Mr. Sheridan left, taking the files, giving no receipts and testified before his committee on September 17th concerning this incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.927" offset="1575058">Now a year-and-a-half later on March 23, 1960, Mr. Presser was indicted for obstructing the Committee in its investigation and according to the indictment that the allegations are that the Committee at that time at all times material to the indictment was duly in the due and proper exercise of its investigative powers pursuant to its authorizing resolution and that in accordance with its own rules of procedure, issued the subpoena demanding the documents which the petitioner knew were relevant to the Committee's investigation and were demanded by the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.548" offset="1805563">During the course of the trial, Sheridan took the stand and in the course of cross-examination of Mr. Sheridan, it was brought out that the subpoena which was served on the petitioner on March 21 of 1958 was in all likelihood prepared in Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.926" offset="1903052">That the subpoena was signed, the blank subpoena was signed by Senator McClellan, Chairman of the McClellan Committee and was addressed by and filled in, the substance of the subpoena filled in by employees in the field office in Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.155" offset="1991973">Now Senator McClellan also had taken the stand and with respect to the organization of the Committee stated with fairly good specificity the subpoena power of the Committee, nothing was said concerning this particular subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.168" offset="2080057">However, the likelihood of Sheridan's testimony was further bolstered when the supplemental subpoena issued on April 1 and in the record as defendant's Exhibit A was without qualification signed by the senator in blank and issued to -- and issued by the field personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.432" offset="2217148">Now at that point in the trial, we asked the Court, we move the Court to quash the subpoena and the indictment and discharge the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.475" offset="2285275">On that particular point, the trial court held that this subpoena was valid and later the Court of Appeals held that it was valid, but that no subpoena was necessary in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.346" offset="2360717">Now our contention is that under the indictment and under the processes of the Committee, the Committee had to be in the -- in order to be in the due and proper exercise of its investigative powers had to have issued a valid subpoena for the production of these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.901" offset="2479000">That the --</text>

            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="596.441" offset="2489135">Is that because of the statute or because of the indictment?</text>

          <turn speaker="john_cardinal" startTime="600.734" stopTime="775.791">
            <label>Mr. John Cardinal</label>
            <text syncTime="600.734" offset="2506271">It's because of the indictment and because of the rules of procedure of the Committee itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.743" offset="2538350">There is rule four of the rules of procedure provides that the chairman has the right to issue subpoenas or he has the right to delegate that authority to a member of the Committee, providing that authority is delegated in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.783" offset="2618493">So that issuance we contend provides not only the signing of a subpoena, but includes the address that would be the subject to whom the subpoena is addressed and the documents or the person's body who is demanded before the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.393" offset="2724968">The fact that issuance has a greater connotation than merely signing the blank subpoena is recognized at page 26 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.858" offset="2786826">And in as much as the Committee in this instance purported to act through its coercive power of the subpoena, we contend that the voluntary turning over of these documents cannot later validate original an originally void process.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.571" offset="2913677">We also contend contrary to the Government that such a process cannot then be ratified by the Committee because the Committee in this case instance, in this particular instance, could not have delegated to Sheridan or any employee the power to make cogent or validate a blank piece of paper signed by Senator McClellan.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.639" offset="3049932">We contend therefore that the trial court was in error that the -- in not discharging the defendant, that the Committee was not in its due and proper exercise of the investigative power authorized under its authorizing resolution, Senate Resolution 74.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.474" offset="3133315">it was in violation of its own rules of procedure that the subpoena was not a defective process, it was a void process and that the void process cannot be validated by ratification because it could not have been delegated in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.978" offset="8091251">Pursuant to the arrangements between the lawyers for Joint Council 41 and the attorneys for the Committee, there were several deliveries of documents pursuant to that subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.134" offset="8139943">That was in the time subsequent to March 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.027" offset="8159483">In the late summer, while this inquiry was going on, the late summer of 1958, the Committee was informed by counsel for the teamsters union and its provisional president that a clean up Commission had been formed of which former Senator Bender was the chairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.442" offset="8241089">The Committee turned its attention in part as part of its inquiry in relationships or the possibility of relationships between former Senator Bender and the teamsters union and as part of the ongoing inquiry in Ohio the investigators of the Committee were instructed to pursue an inquiry into a possible relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.717" offset="8338265">Pursuant to these instructions, the Committee's investigator, Sheridan, called upon the offices of Joint Council 41 to review documents, if any, which should not get and produce in response to the subpoena issued six months prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.398" offset="8404929">The petitioner was agreeable to the inspection of the files in that office and the investigator spent the day reviewing those files.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.966" offset="8443277">He found an invoice described by petitioner's counsel as the Doich Invoice showing gifts to champagne masters, large champagne bucket in which you put a champagne bottle, expensive gifts to former Senator Bender to another Ohio political figure, to officers of the union, and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.093" offset="8543796">He also found a yellow memorandum page, yellow pad page, on which names of recipients of gifts were listed, including the recipients of the champagne masters as well as other names.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.608" offset="8597817">He asked the petitioner for permission to take four folders of documents included in which were these two papers; the invoice and the yellow memorandum page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.916" offset="8643062">The petitioner stated that he was agreeable and then said that he wish to photostat the documents so that he needed to retain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.184" offset="8688097">The investigator said that that was agreeable and an agreement was made that the documents would be left and photostats would be made and they would be turned over directly thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.748" offset="8738356">Four days later, the investigator returned pursuant to telephone arrangements with the petitioner, returned to the office to pick up the four file folders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.819" offset="8782660">Upon the arrival, the petitioner handed in the file folders and the investigator leafed through them and found that the invoice had been mutilated to tear off the bottom portion which listed the eight names of recipients of the gifts of champagne masters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.369" offset="8856848">The yellow memorandum page was missing entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.606" offset="8873775">The investigator called this to the attention of the petitioner and said, “I should have known better than to have trusted you” and the petitioner's response was, “You have your job to do, I have mine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.837" offset="8934693">Petitioner was indicted for concealment of these documents under Section 1505 of Title 18 which makes it a crime corruptly to obstruct the due and proper inquiry of a Committee Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.466" offset="8993207">He was charged, pardon me, he was charged with concealment well knowing that the documents were sought, that they were pertinent to the inquiry and required to be produced and sentenced upon conviction by a jury to eight months confinement.</text>
