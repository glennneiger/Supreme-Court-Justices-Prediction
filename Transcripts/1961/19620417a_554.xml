            <text syncTime="31.443" offset="230149">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.307" offset="245614">The present case, Robinson versus California, is of challenge to and attack upon Section 11721 of the Health and Safety Code of the State of California essentially because we feel that it is a denial of equal protection and due process in that it punishes a status rather than an act or omission, that it punishes an involuntary status, that it punishes a status of physical and mental illness, that it is vague, indefinite and uncertain upon its face, that double jeopardy is inherent in any crime of status and certainly in this -- the present one and that this statute is unwarranted and unconstitutional infringement upon the freedom of movement, that it is ex post facto and that it imposes cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.451" offset="446234">Now, because our case is essentially an attack upon the law itself, the most crucial fact we have before us is the nature and the content or the necessary and implicit application of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.797" offset="503599">However, because we have -- aside or collateral issue or a secondary issue challenge also the search and seizure aspect of this case under the rule of Memphis, Ohio, the recent decision of this Court and because we also feel that under Thompson versus City of Louisville, there is an adequate evidence to sustain the conviction or in fact no evidence at all and hence a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.693" offset="615194">The facts of the case will begin with the arrest itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.829" offset="635674">On a chilly or cold night in February of 1960, the present appellant was riding as a passenger in the backseat of a car accompanied by his lady friend and other party named Banks and his wife were in the front seat, Banks being the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.000" offset="696383">The arresting officers testified that they stopped the vehicle because of an absence of rear license plate illumination.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.979" offset="740268">We feel that the facts as testified by the arresting officers, negative of their excuse for the stoppage and that they actually presented three or four different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.871" offset="791886">Secondly, we said that there was a car that driving slowly upon a dark unlit street and finally that they -- that their -- the territory in question had a reputation for person action and -- interesting also that these officers were not traffic officers, though their original justification, the one accepted by the Court was a traffic stopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.613" offset="882897">They were not traffic officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.794" offset="887599">They're not in a traffic car.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.407" offset="893973">No citation for the traffic violation was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.575" offset="906721">Nothing was said to the -- to any party about driving too slowly, and this is admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.324" offset="925738">And as soon as the stopping took place, they began actually a search of the parties involved to see if they were narcotic addicts of which, they had no indication prior to the stopping of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.883" offset="971922">So, since they were felony officers and were not traffic officers though we -- we do not question the right of any officer to make a traffic stopping or arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.781" offset="1011524">Since they were not traffic officers and did not have anything to do with traffic and stopping the car, we suspect that we have here the typical arrest, aroused arrest for the purpose of search to find whatever they might have found.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.580" offset="1062724">In fact, one of the officers testified that when the driver Banks got out of the car, he shined his light about this person to find whatever he could find.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.174" offset="1105042">And this of course is an admission of a general ex -- search to see what evidence of any crime might have been there present.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.570" offset="1134717">But leave that as it may, upon the stopping, Banks left his vehicle and -- and met the officer halfway.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.007" offset="1160422">And at this point, although it was a cold night of February and even of course the California nights are cold generally, certain in the month of February, this -- this young man obligingly had his -- no jacket on and his shirt sleeves rolled up so the arresting officer could see a single mark upon one of his arms, the right or the left as the case may have been.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.784" offset="1251537">Based upon the seeing of this single mark, the officers made an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.731" offset="1271286">And then having made an arrest, they ordered the other three occupants from the car, searched the car and then searched the three other occupants.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.462" offset="1306290">In the case of the present appellant, they had him take off his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and then went about him with their -- with their flashlight.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.450" offset="1382149">All on the street, yes, public street of -- of the City of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.776" offset="1399495">And -- so after having talked to the appellant, he had said that he admitted having used heroin some time in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.854" offset="1447769">And several weeks ago or at least several days ago or previous Wednesday and he denied the admission but -- but they state that he did admit having used heroin upon at least one occasion on 54th Street in the City of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.997" offset="1516419">And -- so, based upon this admission plus having seen scar tissue in -- in the arms of this appellant after having ordered to remove him his coat, he, like Banks, was also arrested and charged with -- with the offense of being a user under the influence of or addicted to the -- the drug in question or -- or a narcotic drug, the -- the actual which we granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.083" offset="1620699">Now, the testimony, the only testimony on the trial which showed or intended to show any narcotic use at all was on a police officer who was attempted to be qualified as expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.418" offset="1670019">The respondent says he was clearly qualified as an expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.662" offset="1683080">But because narcotics addiction is what is, that's a serious question in my mind as whether or not a police officer has distinguished from a doctor or nurse or something of a medical nature is -- is ever really qualified to tell whether a person is a narcotic addict or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.487" offset="1738355">This of course is -- is a question of arguable thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.487" offset="1746296">We cert -- we don't rely upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.907" offset="1752043">But the only evidence was that of a police officer who stated that this appellant was not under the influence, was not an addict as far as he could see and he relies solely upon the use as shown by some marks on the man's arm.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.051" offset="1812647">Now, of course, the marks themselves are stated to have been from 3 to about 20 days old from one arm from 3 to 10 days and other arm 15 to 20 days as I recall it.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.364" offset="1865832">Of course, the appearance of the marks in the arms could not show where the narcotic had been injected.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.675" offset="1895090">And of course, we have the rule of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.064" offset="1900628">I think generally certain in California on the case that we have cited that venue or the place where a crime was committed whether its murder or the injection of a narcotic must be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.905" offset="1940020">So the expert did not rely upon either influence or addiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.845" offset="1955798">The court nevertheless instructed upon it and admittedly unproven aspect of the law, addiction as well as upon use.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.574" offset="1990698">So we here have a conviction, we did not show clearly to have been either for use or for addiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.311" offset="2013686">We know this more than the other, we must assume so because the court did instruct the jury that they must all find either use or addiction and not six days that he was user and the other six that he was an addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.361" offset="2061855">We cannot know which it was the jury found since the prosecution did not elect between the two of the several counts of Section 11721.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.240" offset="2097382">And so we -- we must of course challenge the -- the conviction under both grounds since -- since the -- we have no such election.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.482" offset="2134371">So then the -- there was no evidence of the place of use except an admission on the part of the -- the appellant himself who denied the admission but it was said by the officer to have state that he used heroin at his arrest and -- and while he was being interrogated by the investigating officer that he had used heroin in the City of Los Angeles sometime before.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.424" offset="2246071">This was, of course, a completed crime not in the presence of the officers and that it took place on Wednesday prior to the -- to the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.068" offset="2276686">So that is essentially the facts of the case, the arrest, and the evidence introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.417" offset="2310019">The appellant denied that he ever used narcotics explain marks all over his body, having been occasion by oversea shots which never got over.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.962" offset="2348262">The young lady with him and he both stated that Banks had a jacket on and he was forced to remove his jacket the same as -- as of this -- this appellant had been and that his mother also testified explaining the marks all over his body, jury to show that he had marks on his back and chest and breast places and not just on his arms of a dark splotches which he -- which he testified with the same as though in his arms.</text>

            <text syncTime="805.496" offset="3326391">So that's been, as I recall, consist -- is a fact of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.282" offset="3345512">Now, because of the instruction of the court under addiction -- had the court not instruct yet on addiction, I would not have my basic approach here today, although I'm happy if the Court did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.021" offset="3396504">As a matter of fact, I'd be willing to -- to abandon or waive or withdraw from my arguments under points B and -- and C regarding the procedural denial of due process with respect to insufficiency of evidence and respect to the search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.802" offset="3467557">Because to me, the crux of this case is the conviction underneath the narcotic law which makes narcotic addiction a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.364" offset="3505904">Now, it is interesting that in only four of the States of the union as we point out from material from the alternative price annuals reports, only four of the States in the union punished narcotics addiction exclusively as a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.298" offset="3561597">In a large number of states, approximately ten, it is punished solely as a sickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.793" offset="3587615">In the others, it is punished or it is treat, let me say or -- or treated as a sickness or punished as a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.168" offset="3613111">So the general approach is and in California surely, it maybe approached either of the crime or under the Welfare and Institutions Code, a party maybe placed in a state hospital of some kind and treated as a narcotics addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.914" offset="3668072">We have no objection to such treatment in a voluntary compulsory and we feel that this is the proper approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.628" offset="3690956">We feel the legislature in this law took not just a why but certainly a constitutional step.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.954" offset="3712167">On the other hand, we have here a law which punishes out a crime the same status or condition which another law of California treats as a sickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.494" offset="3762322">In the first place, I might say in passing that it seems to me that those who are treated under the punishment aspect are denied equal protection as against those who are given the treatment under the Welfare and Institutions Code, which is purely a medical and psychiatric sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.227" offset="3825330">But getting to my first major point under this that any statute which punishes a status as distinguished from an act or omission is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.029" offset="3864513">At this point, may I call the Court's attention to an excellent article Vagrancy Reconsidered which appears in the New York Law Review, the most recent volume, it's -- it's in one of the -- the -- this -- in the January of this year's edition, Vagrancy Reconsidered by -- by the New York University Law Review which points out an answer up to the contention, though not intended to be an answer to the contends of the respondent who holds that both England and America have always accepted status as a proper ground for penalization, that the only basis of a survival, the vagrancy laws in California and of course as we'll point out later, this present law is a type of vagrancy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.394" offset="4057924">The only ground for a survival has been two centuries of uncritical acceptance by our legislatures and courts of outmoded English precedent which has been rejected by England itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.775" offset="4107452">And this is fully pointed out in this article which I mentioned that England no longer has a vagrancy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.054" offset="4128664">They have evolved from vagrancy to -- to conduct, to disorderly conduct which is what California in our most recent legislature changed to and Illinois at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.944" offset="4180177">We know have two States but I think would start up -- would become a trend to get away from punishing the condition and punish specific acts of the inherent wrongness of punishing a person's condition or status is that we are here punishing the possibility of crime, is suspected intent to commit crime, even not an attempt or an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.636" offset="4274949">Normally, throughout our history or in -- in most laws everywhere, a person who's convicted of crime if he does a thing or attempts to do a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.245" offset="4305356">We go beyond the actual completion and do punish the attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.662" offset="4319044">At the same time, we have a constitutional mandate against even an arrest on suspicion merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.187" offset="4345166">But the vagrancy laws of which this is one permits a police officer not just to arrest upon suspicion or because a person might intend to commit a crime because of his vagrant status but he can even be convicted upon suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.479" offset="4402322">So we have just -- and the antithesis or antithesis of the -- of our search and seizure rule which forbids an arrest except in the presence of an actual crime or -- or proper suspicion there as.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.340" offset="4457806">Here, we have a conviction for the suspicion itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.588" offset="4474734">Now, under California law, it is time honor under Section 20 of the Penal Code that we must show either act or omission plus intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.043" offset="4520605">So here, we have neither act n4or omission and we submit no intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.652" offset="4538995">In that under 0.2, this is a -- this is a wholly involuntary status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.096" offset="4556758">Now, the respondent assures the Court that every addict intends to become an addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.029" offset="4580477">However, I think it is clear that an addict no more intended to become that than does an alcoholic intend to become an alcoholic because he may have like to drink socially or because the person intended to acquire venereal disease because he may have voluntarily committed some other act contrary to our -- to the laws of a sexual morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.865" offset="4667831">The point I'm getting at is in -- these three things are -- are similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.481" offset="4686326">The -- a person intends to take a drink, intends perhaps to take shot of heroin or smoke a marijuana cigarette or intends to have an illicit sex act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.785" offset="4723524">None of these intended to acquire venereal disease or to become an alcoholic or to become an addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.499" offset="4742437">As a matter of fact, the intent does not go beyond the initial voluntary act which is not the status which -- which comes from the repeated series, perhaps the voluntary acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.609" offset="4786845">No one, I submit, intends to become an addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.803" offset="4799592">And I think this is clear from our medical discussion which we have and present here the authorities, both from Europe, Dr. Hesse or Hesse, a renowned German physician and two American authorities, American doctors Mower and (Inaudible) and it is uncontradicted that we do have a peer, a condition of mental and physical illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.960" offset="4888200">As a matter of fact, the respondent admits or the appellee admits that this is a mental and physical illness and then goes on to say, however we may punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.923" offset="4928115">The statement properly punish a mental and physical illness and compares it with -- with alcoholism or -- or drunkenness let's say which -- which appellee says he'd be punished, compares it also with kleptomania, the sickness requiring one to steal and with the arsonist who may be ill as distinguished from one or perhaps he's burning his house to collect insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.383" offset="5013901">I -- in a recent speech by the Judge Mirto of the New York bench and California in -- in San Francisco under a conference he had at a baffle time this Court granted this appeal in this case in November of last year, they had a conference on alcohol and American civilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.357" offset="5093836">Judge Mirto stated that he feels that to treat alcoholics as criminals is not only contrary to good social policy but it's unconstitutional and made with respect to alcohol to the point of drunkenness, the same contest that which we are making here with respect to narcotics addiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.262" offset="5181398">We of course hardly agree with the judge and feel that -- that a recent development in our history of our jurisprudence in this development will be that even certain things as kleptomania and arson or whatever, if it can be shown to be actually the product of mental illness as distinguished from a voluntary act will be an illness to be treated so and not a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.938" offset="5280141">Our jails are overcrowded with people who voluntarily and under their own control have done such thing as commit arson or rob, and such people properly belong there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.363" offset="5317862">But if a person does in fact commit the act of theft or an act of arson or any act because of a -- a probably medical condition such person, I think, should be treated and not punished and certainly in the case of alcoholism or a narcotics addiction even more so than the -- than -- than the other categories perhaps because these are clearly and totally mental and physical illnesses which -- which cry out loud for help, for treatment, for hospitalization rather than for -- for the type of punishment which -- which we here apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.435" offset="5454117">Now, we are not alone and respondent assures the Court, appellee assures the Court that we cannot -- have not present any case in which status has been held not a proper subject for legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.830" offset="5511690">However, in the case, the Belcrasto -- Belcrasto case from New York, People versus the Belcastro which is cited by both sides, the court throughout a gangster type vagrancy statute, the New York Court because it held that this was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.645" offset="5587028">In Lanzetta versus New Jersey, this present Court took the same approach to a New Jersey statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.903" offset="5612001">Recently in California, our State Supreme Court in the Newbern, the famous, now famous Newbern case throughout the common drunkard section of our vagrancy laws which is point 11 and -- of which -- the law of which narcotics addiction was originally point 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.476" offset="5694339">Originally, this law was a part of our vagrancy law and was later deleted and put in the Health and Safety Code as a specialized vagrancy ordinance that give a specialized treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.641" offset="5742926">The vagrancy or status aspects remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.267" offset="5753480">But in -- in Newbern and California, Section 11 of 647 of the -- of the Penal Code which in 1961 was changed from vagrancy to disorderly conduct, the appellee, will all the sudden completely solve the problem I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.507" offset="5814397">The Court held that the terms common drunkard was too big, indefinite and uncertain to constitute valid penal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.805" offset="5851596">One of the ground given was that the degree of drunkenness as I recall the -- that the legislature had in mind was not clear from the terms common drunkard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.299" offset="5897571">And under our heading that the present law is vague, indefinite and uncertain, we make a similar holding with respect to addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.862" offset="5927873">And certainly, the term "addict" of all our three terms which are use one, two be under the influence of and three, be addicted to a narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.003" offset="5972386">All three are subject to -- to disagreement among reasonable minds particular with respect to -- to addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.776" offset="6011465">Consider this, the legislature in -- in a section of the Health and Safety Code which we cite by typographical error, we had it wrong and the appellee was kind of give the Court the -- the correct section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.588" offset="6074786">The Legislature of California has legislated that a -- an addicted person is one who has a compulsion to use a substance, which to me is the only proper definition of an addiction as distinguished from habitual use or a single use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.985" offset="6140301">In other words, not merely habit or custom but a compulsion, a physical compulsion which is explained by the doctors, "As actually such a physiological changed that the body will not function normally in the absence of the substance of a narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.510" offset="6198397">When you reach this part, you have a clearly disorganized body which if it has a -- in a proper withdrawal may collapse or even die and this is the kind of treatment we get in the cold turkey California penal treatment of narcotics addiction which every doctor quoted here and certainly generally state must be given medical treatment or -- and a hospital situation, a general taping off or a deep sleep treatment or the application of methadone in order not to have to go through this terrible violent withdrawal which we feel is such abstinence of the application of what we know about the medicine psychiatry that it is in fact cruel and unusual punishment for the condition of addiction which a person is found.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.607" offset="9238841">Mr. McMorris stated the appellant herein was convicted of 11721, Subsection of Health and Safety Code of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.334" offset="9281682">And also has he stated, the cause went to the jury only on two issues, use and addiction under the influence of that aspect of the -- of the Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.589" offset="9330792">The court took from the jury my instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.261" offset="9353467">I may say first getting directly to Mr. McMorris his main contention of purported unconstitutional status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.748" offset="9411354">This addiction statute first became criminal in California in 1929 when it was added to the Penal Code as part of the Vagrancy Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.132" offset="9456912">In 1939, it was deleted from the Penal Code and the Vagrancy Section and put into the new Health and Safety Code which is connected I think at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.604" offset="9502783">Since then, it has remained in the Health and Safety Code and has been amended from time-to-time in minor details.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.826" offset="9535697">In the briefs, both appellant and appellee have referred consistently to vagrancy probably because it's the closest or the -- the most usual, shall we say, statute under which a status is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.752" offset="9623364">Now, its appellee's contention that when this Section was removed from the Vagrancy Section in California and put into the Health and Safety Code, the only remaining aspect of vagrancy or even comparison to vagrancy that remained was the aspects of its status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.103" offset="9716778">And it is our contention that thereafter, the ordinary ideas of vagrancy such as a -- a tramp or a ne'er-do-well or a wonderer and such of the many common known types, we are not involved with the situation like that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.990" offset="9784383">We are involved with a man who is putting a foreign fire into his veins, and it bears no relationship that we contented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.829" offset="9831717">There is no further relationship to vagrancy except -- except the peculiarity status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.278" offset="9865467">Now, counsel has cited many of these vagrancy cases and of course we have cited them, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.638" offset="9890962">And he has referred to two particularly Lanzetta against New Jersey and Edelman against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.248" offset="9925339">The Lanzetta case involved vagrancy decided by this Court and it struck down the -- the statute but not on the ground alone that it punished the status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.244" offset="9981346">They struck him down because it was vague and indefinite in trying to define the status, it was going to punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.389" offset="10005901">The same in Edelman which this Court having taken jurisdiction didn't decide the case on the merits but they were two dissenting opinions that went to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.547" offset="10058564">And the same thing shall I say happen there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.507" offset="10074446">The California Vagrancy Statute was attacked but -- on a very peculiar circumstances by which California or the City of Los Angeles in this instance utilized a Section 6475 of the Penal Code which proscribe, lewd and dissolute conduct making such person a vagrant, that's the statement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.926" offset="10188131">However, in that case, the Edelman case, they didn't plead lewdness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3551.745" offset="14311403">The driver of the automobile voluntarily got out of the car and met the policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.282" offset="14333555">Whereas the policeman there looked for the flashlight, saw the mark on his arm and didn't arrest him then as has been contended.</text>

            <text syncTime="3685.166" offset="14845032">California since this case has -- has been tried, has it not enacted a comprehensive new program of treatment for narcotic addicts added to Section 11 to the Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.851" offset="14895815">The entire program depends upon the term "addiction" as do many federal statutes regarding the entry of immigrants into this country toward drug addicts it's prohibited.</text>

            <text syncTime="3889.443" offset="15662143">That's the contention he's making here that -- this was construction legislature that addiction means habitual customary use as distinguished from compulsive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.357" offset="15689832">I think there's a distinction there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.829" offset="15699759">The -- as a matter of fact, to break it down further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.165" offset="15709059">I cite in my brief two New York cases, the application of Palmer and Palmer against Spaulding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.154" offset="15729016">Spaulding, I think the same man Palmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.364" offset="15737898">In one case, a New York court stated that you must show compulsive use plus an actual deterioration upon the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.031" offset="15768513">I think this has to do with the doctor who was being disqualified because he was deteriorated while using the drug himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.915" offset="15792024">Another case held that the mere compulsion without a showing of deterioration is all that you had to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.066" offset="15816683">So here another court, we have the same conflict, we have in California here between the legislature of the courts because I insist that the California legislature in its only definition of addiction has said compulsive or beyond the power of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.817" offset="15871645">This is the only definition we have -- in -- is our legislature I think it's what they mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.259" offset="15885437">And that's what California legislature says an addict is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.261" offset="15897454">Here, we have a court reading on a new definition in -- in the case cited, it was in -- in a vehicle code thing saying, Well, I know what the purpose of this code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.659" offset="15930995">Well, the legislature does not define it and to another court, they do define it and say we -- it means compulsive use or use beyond the control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.459" offset="15958267">We will say that for this purpose of this code, it -- it means only habitual customary use and this shows the conflict I suspect within the reasonable minds of the judiciary and the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.492" offset="16010407">Now, the same thing is true of the use of the -- of the term "use".</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.597" offset="16030783">Mr. Doran, a reasonable man feels that a single use of -- of a narcotic is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.489" offset="16054397">I think the Legislature meant a customary use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.837" offset="16067772">But here again, the Dictionary, Webster has both of them as meanings for the term "use".</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.168" offset="16085117">So here again, we have a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.987" offset="16092327">And as for the use beyond the influence of aspect, we have the Newbern Rule that just as the common was undefinable so -- and also because the Legislature did not show to what extent they have in mind with reference to -- to what extent drug has became common or what point it became common.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.519" offset="16162440">As to addiction, we don't know what the Legislature has in mind, as to what degree.</text>
