            <text syncTime="132.091" offset="632748">The instant prayer or the instant religious activity or exercise arose from a meeting of the Board of Regents of the State of New York on November 30th, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.747" offset="683426">At that time, the Board of Regents which in effect is the highest educational authority in the State of New York, issued a statement entitled, "The Regent Statement on Moral and Spiritual Training in Schools".</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.357" offset="5077849">Now bearing in mind, of course, the McCollum was the only case that this Court has established violat -- has held violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.936" offset="5116092">First contention that we make to bring our case within the McCollum doctrine, is that the religious activities we're during school hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.251" offset="5157366">Covered we -- we call in the McCollum case this was true that the students were left out of the main classroom to go to other classrooms within the buildings to take religious instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.466" offset="5202296">Second fact is that there was a direct cooperation in the McCollum case between state officials and religious activity and that particular instance as was cooperation between the State and sectarian religious activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.256" offset="5245450">In our case, the direct cooperation, of course, is the fact that the teacher participates in the saying of a prayer, leads the prayer and cooperates in carrying out the mandate of the Board of Education requiring religious training in the public schools to this extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.664" offset="5343044">The third factor is that tax supported buildings were used to aid in the teaching of religion in the public school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.293" offset="5381601">This was one of the -- also of course, one of the main points in Zorach where this Court made it perfectly clear that in Zorach, the tax supported buildings were not used to aid religion or religions or to prefer one religion against the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.278" offset="5445548">The fourth is that the children who do not -- did -- did not participate in the religious instruction on the McCollum case didn't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.257" offset="5481388">It was a voluntary on part of the parents to send their teacher to the particular sectarian religious instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.679" offset="5511064">Of course in our case, the same thing occurs because it is voluntary that parents can refuse to have their children participate in this religious activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.010" offset="5552441">And finally, the participation, and this is practically the same as the last point, is the same bec -- because it's limited to children whose parents consent to participate in the -- in the activity itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.551" offset="5614613">There's one major difference however between the McCollum case and our case which we think makes our case more stronger or stronger than the McCollum case and that is the fact that there's teacher participation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.731" offset="9535279">Brown against the Board of Education has as its nemesis or as core a statement to the effect that to separate children from one another solely because of their color, solely because of their color, may leave an indelible mark upon that child for the rest of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.984" offset="9644366">It was suggested by this Court that such discrimination, such separation would not be permitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2401.305" offset="9709568">Aren't we in effect saying that if a child can be excused from school voluntarily, we're taking that child out of an environment?</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.638" offset="9874975">Now, I would like to, for a few moments, address myself to the arguments of my friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.731" offset="9911338">My friends made three major arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.559" offset="9934639">Their first argument is that this case falls within the Zorach doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.855" offset="9971837">They cease upon Mr. Justice Douglas' statement that we are a religious nation whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.369" offset="10009872">And that the State may act to accommodate religion, that the State should not be antagonistic towards religion and that the duty of the State under certain circumstances is to promote or to safeguard the religious heritage of our nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.304" offset="10097643">I say that this prayer really is only an accommodation to religion and it's not only permissive but it's the obligation of the State to preserve our heritage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.947" offset="10156157">We say of course that this case does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.810" offset="10167651">Many distinguishing factors occur, one of course is that in Zorach, this Court specifically sustained or reaffirmed the McCollum Doctrine and the activity there was outside of the school system, not within the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.693" offset="10227210">There was no direct participation by the State in the religious activity complained of in Zorach as it was in the McCollum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.092" offset="10264722">And we also say that Zorach, although stating that the State can cooperate in certain areas with religion, cannot be construed the whole that it would condone a religious activity of the State where the State itself composes its own prayer and then it's instituted -- instituted in our compulsory institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.794" offset="10371615">Second argument my friends made is the argument raised earlier by or suggested earlier by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, Barnette against the Board of Education.</text>

            <text syncTime="4113.630" offset="16558874">And here is where my friend and I depart in our thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.282" offset="16581548">Since the earliest days of this country, going back to the Mayflower Compact, the men who put the country together have publicly and repeatedly recognized the existence of a Supreme Being, a God.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.404" offset="16662006">There have grown in this country and in this world many branches of religion, most of which recognize a deity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.644" offset="16711011">There are people, however, who go to no organized church and are not part of any particular religion who likewise believe in that deity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.036" offset="16756569">When therefore, we say here, this prayer which Mr. Justice Frankfurter characterized as an avowal of faith, an avowal which recognizes that there is some Supreme power, some Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.863" offset="16839847">We are proceeding fully in the Court with the tradition and heritage which has been handed down to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.823" offset="16875687">We know, of course, that in the Declaration of Independence, we have four references to the Creator, to the Supreme Being who gave us his -- gave us our unalienable rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.653" offset="16930962">We can't rewrite history now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.121" offset="16940889">Those words are emblazoned in that document, and they will always be with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.681" offset="16967116">Our colonies, one by one as they adopted the Constitution, recognized the existence of an Almighty God, a Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.913" offset="17016017">And as of today with our 50 States, 49 out of the 50 so recognize this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.640" offset="17046946">Indeed, if the Court in its review of the briefs at a later date will examine in Appendix A, we have collected extracts from either the preambles or the constitutions of 49 of our 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.411" offset="17114028">We will find there language quite comparable, one after another starting out, "We, the people of the State of Arkansas or New York, grateful to Almighty God for his blessings and -- and acknowledging our dependence upon Him".</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.309" offset="17181633">These are the Constitutions which protect the rights of the citizens of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.929" offset="17208069">And in an effort to arrive at a prayer which would continually recognize that Supreme Being as part of the opening exercises at our schools, the words were lifted, if you will from these preambles and constitutions, and made a -- a part of this prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.504" offset="17310365">So we go back again to saying, "Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee", as a paraphrasing of what appears in most of our state constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.135" offset="17360938">I might say that this is not just my characterization of those state constitutions either.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.978" offset="17384344">The Court has before it now, a brief submitted by 19 out of 20 states which have now sought intervention in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.793" offset="17423527">19 Attorneys General have said, "We don't believe that this violates our state constitution and we urge upon the Supreme Court that this practice continue".</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.852" offset="17475772">The 20th of course is our own New York State where a brief has been filed on behalf of the State Education Department urging again that the prayer be continued and that of the saying of it not be held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.805" offset="17551632">Now, we're not unfamiliar with Zorach against Clauson and the McCollum case and the Everson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.359" offset="17581829">And we realize the reliance in those cases on the words, "Separation of church and state".</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.751" offset="17611400">We recognize also that -- that in those cases, the courts used language which said, "The state and religion need not be hostile to each other, it need not be alien and unfriendly, but that there is an area of accommodation which can be made between the state and religion".</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.345" offset="17701784">And this was after reviewing a background of how the First Amend -- Amendment evolved, and how we got to the words "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion" which we recognize under the Fourteenth Amendment then becomes applicable to our State of New York and to its smallest subdivisions or School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.872" offset="17795929">We recognize that that First Amendment applies as much as to the Herricks School District as it does to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4430.496" offset="17826335">But after tracing the history of that, many courts have said, "None of that language prohibits a religious state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.666" offset="17879103">It may well prevent and prohibit a state religion but not in reverse".</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.230" offset="17909300">This Court has said many times, "We are essentially a religious people".</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.834" offset="17935736">They've repeated that in Zorach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.972" offset="17952246">But we are not trying here in the Herricks School District to teach religion, as my friend has characterized it, anymore than this Mr. Justice Brennan, asked the question on the prayer used in this Court, and this is part of our brief, we have used that same argument, Mr. Justice Brennan in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4480.491" offset="18026329">Suppose the prayer used in the Herricks School District were paraphrased to meet the exact wording of the prayer of this Court."</text>

            <text syncTime="4496.570" offset="18090695">But now we get there onto the word "semantic".</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.164" offset="18105010">Whether or not, the recognition of a Supreme Being on a public occasion amounts to a religion to an establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.827" offset="18151717">We have seen in the decided cases, we've heard comment here this morning that whenever a group of men get together, it seems to be proper to recognize the source of our blessings and our freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.952" offset="18224232">Even in our own Herricks School District when we opened up our new high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.214" offset="18241264">We had several faiths represented on the platform who asked God's blessing on the use of these schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.331" offset="18265715">Is this a sponsorship by the Herricks School District of a religion or an establishment of religion or is this not once again recognizing that there is a Supreme Being on which we rely?</text>

            <text syncTime="6319.762" offset="25383455">I represent a group of intervenor parents who came into the case very shortly after it started by intervention, with the four rights of parties under the New York Civil Practice Act as persons especially and beneficially interested in upholding the determination here assailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6342.636" offset="25474988">My clients, we have heard from my friend about the views of some religious faiths, my clients include three Jewish parents, seven protestant parents of five separate denominations, one person of no religious affiliation or whatever and five Catholics.</text>
            <text syncTime="6369.387" offset="25581986">When this case started, they had 37 children in the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="6376.169" offset="25609049">Rather the reverse of the diremos situation, on the last count, my clients now have 41 children in the public schools, so there is no question of mootness here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6390.317" offset="25665682">The question by the way was asked to my opponent or asked to Mr. Daiker as to whether there was any question about the standing of these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="6398.806" offset="25699641">We do not question the fact that any of them or that they are all taxpayers and they are all parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.866" offset="25727854">But the question of standing in the complete absence of pocketbook injury and the question withstanding in the absence of what we understood to be any objection to the prayer maybe something else again but that these petitioners, like my clients, are all taxpayers and parents, it's undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6427.247" offset="25813431">Why are my clients here at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="6432.105" offset="25832866">They are here in the name of free exercise religion if you want to put it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6438.446" offset="25858152">They are here because they feel very strongly that it is a deprivation of their children's right to a share in our national heritage and that it is a compulsory rewriting of our history in the fashion of George Orwell's 1984 to do what these petitioners are now seeking to do, namely, to eliminate all reference to God from the whole fabric of our public life and of our public educational system.</text>

            <text syncTime="6511.107" offset="26148843">It is an attempt to drive out of the public education system practices which are long established, venerated and practiced without objection throughout the country from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="6526.552" offset="26210597">The practice of prayer in the public schools of New York, to be specific, goes back to 1837.</text>
            <text syncTime="6534.308" offset="26241630">According to figures cited in our brief, the practice of either a prayer of some sort or another or a Bible reading or hymn singing or any two or three of them, is prevalent throughout the public schools of at least half the states of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="6550.651" offset="26307041">And as Mr. Daiker observed, 19 Attorneys General have come in here with an amicus brief pointing out the widely precautions which would be affected if my friend's position were to be adopted as the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="6798.740" offset="27299380">The flag salute, in 1954 had the words "under God" added to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6806.816" offset="27331668">And the question was asked whether that had a religious connotation or it was a religious exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="6812.013" offset="27352461">And I say unequivocally, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6814.539" offset="27362597">And I say it on the authority of the House report which recommended those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="6821.949" offset="27392167">And Pledge of Allegiance is in almost every public school throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6827.358" offset="27413797">And this is why the words "under God" are recited by school children in that pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6832.955" offset="27436262">This is what the House Committee said, "Our American Government is founded on the concept of the individuality and the dignity of the human being.</text>
            <text syncTime="6842.362" offset="27473878">Underlying this concept is the belief that the human person is important because he was created by God and endowed by Him with certain inalienable rights which no civil authority may usurp.</text>
            <text syncTime="6855.989" offset="27528317">The inclusion of God in our pledge would further acknowledge the dependence of our people and our Government up with the moral directions of the Creator".</text>
            <text syncTime="6866.641" offset="27570949">And the question presented in this case is whether this group of petitioners have the right to outlaw from our whole public educational process anything which would suggest an acknowledgement of dependence of our people and our Government and our school children upon the moral directions of the Creator.</text>
