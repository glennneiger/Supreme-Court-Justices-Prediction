            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="123.922" offset="601067">The statute under which they were convicted which appears in Louisiana Statutes Annotated Title 14, Section 103 contains seven subsections and it is pertinent to the case that I briefly review the provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.581" offset="683719">The introductory provision states and I quote, “Disturbing the peace is the doing of any of following in such a manner as would foreseeably disturb or alarm the public.”</text>
            <text syncTime="158.761" offset="740456">And then there are six subsections which I will rapidly paraphrase and the seven subsections under which they were convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.461" offset="779222">The first six subsections provide defines as disturbing of peace: (1) engaging in a fist fight, (2) using unnecessarily loud, offensive, or insulting language (3), appearing in an intoxicated condition, (4) engaging in any act in a violent and tumultuous manner by any three or more person, (5) holding an unlawful assembly and (6) interfering with a lawful assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.141" offset="914014">The seventh subsection, under which they were convicted and the only subsection which is directly applicable to this case makes criminal the commission of any other act in such a manner as to unreasonably disturb or alarm the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.860" offset="1000845">The penalties provided by this Act or a fine of $100 imprisonment for not more than 90 days or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.435" offset="1059150">Before stating the facts of each of these three cases, each of which differ somewhat from one another, petitioners will first briefly identify two of their legal arguments which are common to all of the cases that these arguments are intimately related to each other and to the fact and because presentation of the facts petitioner submit will dispose of the largest part of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.650" offset="1180045">Petitioners first contend that (1), as this statute has been construed previously by the State Supreme Court in Louisiana, (2) by its plain and ordinary meaning, and (3) by reading it in a context of Louisiana Legislation passed after the sit-ins occurred for the purpose of dealing with sit-ins, the statute now under scrutiny requires the proof of elements of guilt which do not at all appear upon these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.053" offset="1325599">And that the judgment below upon a record barren of evidence is fatally defective under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as this Court held in Thompson versus City of Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.181" offset="1382128">On the other hand, petitioners contend that if this statute is not to be read as having its ordinary, settled meaning by which I submit there can be no question, it must stand for the proposition that the presence of a Negro at a lunch counter which by custom in Louisiana is reserved for white persons is as a matter of law a disturbance of the peace, and therefore, the only factor upon which these convictions rest is that these petitioners were Negroes seated at white lunch counters.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.938" offset="1533221">As a consequence the convictions are defective under the Fourteenth Amendment which forbids the State to enforce racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.413" offset="1571046">The other issues in this case which I might mention briefly at this point involve a challenge to the statute on the ground that (1) it is unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and (2) a challenge to the judgment below on the ground that a punished expression protected by the First Amendment as read into the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.240" offset="1686403">Before going to the first two issues, however, petitioners will first make clear what is not involved in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.063" offset="1713674">These cases do not involve a variety of questions proposed by respondent's brief and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.495" offset="1743350">There is no question in this case of the validity or constitutionality of disturbing the peace or breach of the peace statutes in their normal use or operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.649" offset="1787967">Two, there is no question in this case of the validity of state enforcement of choice of guests or persons with whom one would associate where the law or recognizes an almost unlimited right of privacy such as in the home or in a strictly private club.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.706" offset="1856199">Three, there is no question in this case of anyone being punished for having and attempting to exercise by the use of private action only a personally held racial prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="706.120" offset="2929936">There's a two-page opinion which appears near the end of each of the records which states briefly that the State Supreme Court is without power to review the fact and the trial court was correct on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.252" offset="2994406">They said the opinion consist merely of two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.194" offset="3010184">If you were inquiring whether there was an opinion of the denial of the motions to quash the answer to that is no, just merely do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.709" offset="3048218">On page 29 of the Garner record, which is Number 26, the manager, Mr. Willis, who was in fact the owner of Sitman's Drugstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.785" offset="3092522">Mr. Willis testified that on March 29th, 1960 the two petitioners came into the store and they simply seated themselves at the lunch counter, described the episode as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.706" offset="3148215">They occupied two seats, in their presence they have caused me to approach them a short time later and advised them that we couldn't serve them and I believe that the police came and arrested them and took them away.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.517" offset="3195444">He was asked what they said and what happened on this occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.074" offset="3209759">He said one asked for coffee and I told them we couldn't serve them and one of the boys said he wants some coffee.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.860" offset="3228881">Then said the police arrived within 10 minutes, less than 10 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.086" offset="3245808">He made it quite clear that he did not call the police and he did not know who called the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.826" offset="3264721">Although, there's an inference that a police officer in the store perhaps had called them and the police captain later testified that he was called by the cop on the beat and we might assume that this was the same person.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.841" offset="3316757">Testified that in this store he used his words and page 32 of the record, Negroes are very good customers and indeed one of the petitioners in this case had purchased an umbrella in the store.</text>

            <text syncTime="832.475" offset="3435353">That consists of the testimony of the manager of the store as to his experience with this event.</text>
