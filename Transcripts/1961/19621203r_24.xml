            <text syncTime="22.306" offset="192554">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.833" offset="214706">This is the second argument of one of the cases which was argued before eight-judge court last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.694" offset="242186">This is a suit for refund on tax moneys paid under protest to the State of Louisiana where the field of state taxation of interstate commerce, constitutional law, the Interstate Commerce Clause forbids tax discrimination by states against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.691" offset="318151">The equal protection of the laws clause or the Due Process Clause forbids arbitrary tax discrimination by states even if there is no element of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.587" offset="365693">Classifications for tax purposes may not be held by the arbiter.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.290" offset="392547">The Louisiana Supreme Court has held that Louisiana may discriminate against the multistate or interstate business and thus give a direct commercial advantage to local business.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.457" offset="441240">It held specifically that Louisiana may place an excise tax upon the interstate business of Halliburton which is three times as heavy as the tax burden would be -- upon the same identical, and I emphasize the word “identical” operation if it were purely local and intra-Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.651" offset="525981">The Halliburton Company of Duncan, Oklahoma has appealed from the Louisiana Supreme Court urging the invalidity of the discriminatory tax and claiming the constitutional protection of three clauses, interstate commerce, equal protection and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.422" offset="593063">This Court noted probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.445" offset="609155">The tax in question is the Louisiana use tax, a part of the sales and use tax law of the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.441" offset="637158">The tax rate is 2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.843" offset="646771">The case of the sales tax, the intrastate tax, the rate is 2% of the sales price of intrastate sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.456" offset="677177">In the case of the use tax, the interstate tax, the rate is 2% of cost price to the purchaser who imports, that is who purchases outside Louisiana and imports through channels of interstate commerce into Louisiana for its own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.760" offset="746454">Halliburton's complaint is not of the tax rate which is 2% in both cases but Halliburton does complain of discrimination in the determination of the tax basis to which the 2% rate is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.052" offset="803610">Specifically, Halliburton complains that the tax base is larger, three times larger in the case of the intrastate use tax which falls upon Halliburton and the tax base would be in the case of the intrastate sales tax which would fall upon a local intrastate competitor of Halliburton in an identical -- in an identical intrastate business operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.618" offset="1213837">It is a manufacturer which uses its own work product.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.751" offset="1234422">And economists would classify it as a manufacturer-user or producer consumer.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.553" offset="1453537">The -- on page 16 of the record, we found it quite helped to visualize this equipment, opposite page 16 of the record, you'll see a piece of this equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.641" offset="1489899">The cost of materials that goes into that which of course would include the truck chassis sir, is roughly one-third of total cost, the cost of labor and overhead in assembling this rather intricate piece of scientific equipment which is used to service oil wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.924" offset="1547055">And the labor and overhead element is $60,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.688" offset="1558131">And here Your Honor, you put your finger on the essence of the case that the labor and overhead is two-thirds of cost and the cost of materials is one-third of costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.139" offset="1591881">Specifically, if Halliburton had its shops in Louisiana, there would be a sales tax on the cost of materials but there would be no sales tax or use tax on the labor and shop overhead expanded in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.331" offset="1648724">One of these things comes up to the Louisiana state line, the Collector hails it down and he says, “I've just audited your books Halliburton, and I see that on your books, this thing stands at $90,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.421" offset="1693027">$30,000 of that is materials, $60,000 is that of labor and overhead, you're going to bring that thing into Louisiana and use it, you've got to pay me 2% of $90,000”.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.038" offset="1735555">“Not so”, says Halliburton.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.651" offset="1741928">“We'll pay you 2% of the $30,000 cost of materials and we won't pay you anything more”.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.919" offset="1763035">And we say that because if we had our production shops in Louisiana, if we were a manufacturer in Louisiana instead of manufacturer in Oklahoma, we would pay a sales tax on materials, there will be no tax on labor and overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.481" offset="1829282">Intrastate labor and overhead is tax free.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.940" offset="1843179">We respectfully submit to the State of Louisiana and to this Court that multistate or intrastate labor and overhead should be equally tax free.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.976" offset="1879228">If in the recipe, no new ingredient is added to the recipe except the element of interstate commerce, we say that that should not affect the ultimate tax result and that is the situation here no matter how thin it is sliced.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.335" offset="1940668">Multistate activity and interstate movement of goods cannot constitutionally generate a tax which would not exist in the absence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.609" offset="1973791">If Halliburton had it's -- suppose Halliburton had a shop right on the Louisiana-Texas line and suppose -- let's put Loui -- Halliburton just outside the Louisiana-Texas line over in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.674" offset="2018095">Let's put a competitive Halliburton right jump against the line on the -- in the Louisiana side.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.243" offset="2040351">Let's put a one inch wide whitewash fence line between them by the ones that the competitor -- to producers in Louisiana and uses itself, there will be a 2% tax on the $30,000 materials element.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.410" offset="2093014">There would be no Louisiana tax on the labor and shop overhead but every unit produce one inch further away from the Louisiana state capital across that line in Texas assuming that Texas had no such statutes to such costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.494" offset="2153305">For every one of those units that make -- moves that extra inch of difference which makes it an interstate transaction, Louisiana says, “We're going to tax that labor and overhead”.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.145" offset="2191966">Now, the tax here sir, is in a ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.187" offset="2204087">Discrimination is in a ratio of three to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.383" offset="2216939">But that's a happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.950" offset="2223208">We're talking about tax versus no tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.690" offset="2242121">Add the element of interstate commerce, taxation of labor and overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.961" offset="2259257">Eliminate that element of tax -- of interstate movement, no taxation of labor and overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.677" offset="2286111">Mr. Chief Justice Warren at the earlier argument of this case suggested the hypothet of the do-it-yourself radio parts kit.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.174" offset="2320071">Our 14-year-old boy, I send him to a camp in South Louisiana, going through New Orleans, he saved up $50.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.486" offset="2349328">He buys a do-it-yourself kit of radio parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.685" offset="2362075">He takes it to camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.088" offset="2367718">He finds that the job of sticking it together is too complex and having some extra money from some source, he hires the more sophisticated boy in the next tent to put it together and he pays him a $150 for labor to put that together.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.916" offset="2422993">He brings it home.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.645" offset="2425919">He hasn't been out of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.503" offset="2433337">He's got a finished radio, $50 in materials, $100 in labor, $150 total cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.291" offset="2472521">There has been a Louisiana sales tax on the materials, no sales or use tax on the labor and overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.753" offset="2506376">Change the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.022" offset="2511496">Inject one new ingredient only enabling interstate commerce that they sent him camp on the Maryland coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.316" offset="2536678">On a route through Washington, he goes to (Inaudible) and he buys the same kit radio parts.</text>

            <text syncTime="615.774" offset="2566457">Again, it's too complex a job for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.663" offset="2573981">He can't put them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.020" offset="2579414">Again, there's a more clever boy in the next tent.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.934" offset="2591117">That $100 he had to put the radio kit or parts together.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.582" offset="2609716">Now, he's got a $150 radio, the same radio, the same $50 in materials, the same $100 in labor and overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.124" offset="2647855">Through channels of interstate commerce, he takes that finished radio back to the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.049" offset="2667604">The State of Louisiana would put a tax on a $150.</text>

            <text syncTime="784.692" offset="3242088">If you have -- if Halliburton were a multistate operator which purchased this equipment outside the state and then moved into Louisiana, its tax would be exactly to that same -- the same as it would be if it were an intrastate purchaser who purchased the equipment and then went ahead and used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.028" offset="3335502">In each case, where there has been a purchase with or without the element of interstate commerce end, the tax would fall on the purchase price or cost price which would include three elements, A -- (1) rather, materials, (2) labor and overhead and (3), the cost -- the profit of the producer or distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.551" offset="3425573">Now, let's -- Halliburton purchased in Oklahoma and brought it into Louisiana, the tax would be on the purchase price.</text>

            <text syncTime="1408.871" offset="5738872">But if, I should initiate that transaction right here today, if I should take it off and sell it to him for a dollar, and if he took that thing back into Louisiana so that the sale took place here, and the use took place in Louisiana, then Louisiana would demand a 2% use tax on that because they say that there is no such thing as an isolated use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.147" offset="5839914">Specifically, in the Halliburton case, Halliburton bought an airplane in New York from a newspaper company that wasn't in the business of selling such things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.643" offset="5953912">With reference to the airplane, if they -- that airplane have been flown by the vendor, not by Halliburton into the Morrison Airport in New Orleans and if there, it had been purchased by Halliburton, then there would've been no Louisiana sales tax on the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.099" offset="6035728">But if Halliburton goes outside the state and gets that piece of equipment and then flies it in, Louisiana would place a tax upon it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1752.917" offset="7115003">Henneford versus Silas Mason, 1936 before this Court, the use tax was attacked on the grounds that it would be offensive to the interstate Commerce Clause because it only falls upon situations where there's been an interstate movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.961" offset="7183235">The use tax is upheld in that case despite the fact that the use tax only falls upon transactions involving in interstate commerce because in a case then at bar, Silas Mason, the use tax of the State of Washington did not exceed the sales tax of the same state but was merely complimentary to and precisely equal to the sales tax of the same state therefore there was no discrimination, hence no unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.282" offset="7264528">And Mr. Justice Cardozo made it plain that that was his rationale with this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.647" offset="7281977">Equality, he says, is a theme that runs through all sections of the Washington statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.325" offset="7320639">In each situation, the burden of the use tax is balanced by an equal burden of the sales tax where the sale is strictly lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.372" offset="7344880">And Mr. Justice Cardozo concluded a nondiscriminatory tax, a nondiscriminatory tax has never been regarded as imposing a direct burden upon the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.932" offset="7383124">Now, we respectfully submit that implicit in the Silas Mason decision and corrected so, is the proposition that whenever the use tax, the interstate tax does exceed the intrastate tax in an identical situation, not comparing a manufacturer-user, with the purchaser at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.739" offset="7458356">The purchaser at retail, intrastate versus purchaser at retail intrastate, manufacturer-user interstate versus manufacturer-user intrastate, we respectfully submit that the additional ingredient of interstate commerce cannot constitutionally create a tax where it non-existed in its absence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1862.587" offset="7553755">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.229" offset="7568280">I think that we can show that Louisiana hasn't done quite as bear as Mr. Taylor would have the quote I believe, I think that the theme of our law is equality and it is certainly is a definite attempt to equalize all the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.617" offset="7625853">And of course he says that we attempt to compare incomparables and we say that he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.745" offset="7654379">In this case, it's true that a manufacturer-user in Louisiana would pay a tax only on the items that they themselves either purchased in Louisiana, they'd pay the 2% sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.329" offset="7716655">This is what they use in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.918" offset="7727000">If they purchased it outside of Louisiana, in this case, knots and bolts and sheet metal and the chassis and maybe a motor, what they bring in to Louisiana and that the item that they used as of the time they bring it in and becomes part of the mass of property that is out of commerce, then that is what is taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.026" offset="7803486">And that is the moment of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.047" offset="7815607">In this case, they bring in a completed item and that is what they use in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.840" offset="7846745">And a manufacturer-user such as Halliburton in Louisiana whose manufacturing trucks for use all over the world would pay the tax on all of the knots and bolts, on all of the sheet metal, on all of the chassis and of all the motors no matter where it went.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.690" offset="7926157">And if management found that they could afford to pay the tax on all of the items that they did use, and produced in Louisiana more cheaply rather than pay them the item that they did bring to Louisiana, well then, certainly, it is a management problem of location.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.565" offset="7993657">It isn't even a loophole in taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.213" offset="8004211">Because they're being taxed as of the taxable moment on what they do use in Louisiana and we do not tax overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.906" offset="8039006">And we do not tax labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.041" offset="8047574">We tax value or cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.418" offset="8061053">We tax the cost in the sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.453" offset="8069204">We tax the cost in the use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.955" offset="8083205">It's true that the labor and shop overhead in this case formed the part of the value or cost of the item.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.229" offset="8112253">But Louisiana is not taxing labor and shop overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.184" offset="8132106">We are taxing what has been brought into Louisiana and what is being used in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.388" offset="8152900">And as of that time, which is the only time that Louisiana gets jurisdiction incidentally, at least the first moment that they get jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.502" offset="8273377">The moment of taxation in both cases is identical is a moment that a user or consumer takes the property and is ready for using it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.608" offset="8313814">And as of that moment, that's the moment of taxation in both cases, the rate is the same and the base is the same because it is the cost of the item as of that moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.839" offset="8354774">Now, in this case, -- well, really what they're complaining about almost is the -- is that it's a cheaper tax when you prove that you eat home than it is when you eat out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.226" offset="8408273">But the situation is a diff -- different because in this case when you eat home, you buy a large quantity of food and you pay tax on all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.018" offset="8443486">It's true that per meal maybe the tax is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.853" offset="8462817">But if you come through Louisiana and you stop and you buy meal at the restaurant, you buy your steak and you pay $4, you pay 2% on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.500" offset="8493328">If you ate that same steak at home, well, it will be whatever the cost was in the store but you're going to -- you pay on all of your groceries no matter where you eat them, no matter -- whether you eat it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.740" offset="8546304">In other words, if they're spoiled, you would still have paid your tax at the moment that you purchased it.</text>
