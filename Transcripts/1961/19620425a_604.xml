            <label>Mr. John G. Laughlin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="23.492" offset="197360">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.535" offset="229543">I speak for the United States which is here as an amicus curiae in support of the petition and the petitioner and to the courtesy of counsel for the petitioner and he has allotted me 25 minutes of his time and has agreed that I might open the case on the part of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.983" offset="331316">The case brings before the Court a question of statutory interpretation and application and the statute itself provides an exemption from taxation and suits by creditors of benefits payable and administered by Veterans' Administration under the various benefit laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.803" offset="430582">Perhaps that the outset should indicate the Government's interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.213" offset="452211">The statute which is now before the Court is a derivation of similar statutes that have been on the books for the better part of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.353" offset="496828">Under current laws administered by the Veterans' Administration in some 12 million individuals were on the roles as recipients of various veterans -- or various benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.974" offset="539251">These are payable not only to the veterans but in giving instances to the widows, parents and children of veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.032" offset="579480">A very substantial sum of money is involved running into billions of dollars annually and the Government's interest as we come here today is to what we hope is to keep faith with the congressional purpose not only in providing for these benefits but in providing that the benefits shall be immune from creditor suits as well as from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.695" offset="694105">Coming to the facts of the immediate case, they date to 1952 when the petitioner was indicted for murder here in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.037" offset="731512">A trial on that indictment resulted in his acquittal by reason of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.483" offset="757321">He was thereupon committed to St. Elizabeth's where he presently resides.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.779" offset="786474">The murder with which he was charged took place while he was an employee of a certain realty company within the District of Columbia and engaged in that employment, painting certain apartment dwellings within the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.130" offset="855855">The administratrix of the decedent's estate brought a wrongful debt action against the petitioner's employer and another party not relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.134" offset="907891">And as that suit ultimately turned out, a settlement was agreed upon and some $16,000 was paid over to the estate of the deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.739" offset="958360">The suit was defended and the settlement was arranged by the respondent here who then under a subrogation clause of its policy; liability policy, obtained an indem -- indemnity judgment over against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.296" offset="1032547">To obtain satisfaction of that judgment, writs of attachment were sued out against two savings and loan accounts within the district and a checking account in a local bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.235" offset="1088345">It is agreed at this point that the funds on deposit in both the savings and loan association and the bank are derived solely from disability compensation benefits paid by the Veterans' Administration pursuant to veterans benefit legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.129" offset="1175907">Writs -- motions to quash the several writs were made and sustained by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.824" offset="1210702">The judgment of the District Court was reversed by the Court of Appeals and then the Court of Appeals; the only issue was asked to the immunity of the savings deposits on file or with -- with these two savings and loan associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.628" offset="1273919">The issue as to the immunity of the bank account was eliminated from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.940" offset="1303176">There are three prior decisions of this Court under previous statutes preceding the one now in effect, 38 U.S.C. 3101 (a) which are immediately relevant to the issue now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.400" offset="1372975">These three cases were decided in a span of a 3-year -- a 6-year span between 1933 and 1939 and in brief, they hold, first of all the -- that the immunity provided by the statute did not extend to permanent investments which in the Trotter case to which I am referring consisted of real estate and buildings thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.765" offset="1494392">The second case to which I -- in the order in which they were decided is Lawrence v. Shaw, where the Court held that bank deposits subject to the draft by the veterans' guardian were not subject to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.841" offset="1562728">In other words, the immunity right about the statute from taxation carried over unto -- until so long as these banks for these -- the funds were on deposit with the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.569" offset="1613615">The third and final case to which I refer is Carrier v. Bryant where government bonds and negotiable notes purchased with benefit moneys were held not to be immune from a creditor's suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.462" offset="1685191">It was on the basis of these three decisions that the two courts below reached opposite conclusions and that there was a division within the -- the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.721" offset="1738271">It is the Government's position that consistent with the purpose not only of the benefit payments themselves but of the immunity which attends these benefits that the funds here in issue, savings account deposits with federal savings and loan association should be held immune from the suit by Aetna Casualty Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.916" offset="1847045">We would rely primarily upon the bank account decision of Lawrence v. Shaw where the Court made it plain that the congressional purpose could not have been to require that the recipients of these benefits carry them on their person or maintain them under the roof in order to prot -- protect and continue the immunity that the statute otherwise plainly accorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.713" offset="1974209">Rather, the Court made it plain that the conventional modes of receipt and retention of moneys should be recognized and that the immunity did attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.720" offset="2026245">We cannot, of course, equate a savings account deposit in a savings and loan association with a checking account in a commercial bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.857" offset="2066787">Nonetheless, in our judgment, the similarities between the two are such that the same result should obtain in this case as obtained in the bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.665" offset="2130004">There are, of course, legal and very importantly legal distinction between an ordinary deposit or checking account deposit in a commercial bank and the savings deposits that are here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.933" offset="2187055">There is, of course, a debtor-creditor relationship in a commercial checking account whereas in here, the depositor acquires a share and interest in the capital of the savings and loan association.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.231" offset="2244315">This, as I say, is a very important difference but it is in the difference that becomes important only in the event of an economic emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.372" offset="2292903">And, over recent -- over the -- over in recent years, dating back since the financial crisis of the late 1920's and the early 1930's and with the advent of federal insurance not only of commercial savings accounts but federal insurance which extends to the very accounts that are here involved, the public has become more and more to regard these institutions as, if I may so -- say so, the -- a conventional mode of retention of the dollars that millions of Americans are able to put aside for some emergent use.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.367" offset="2468864">We think it does no great violence to either the principles of the Trotter case or Carrier v. Bryant if the character of these deposits are recognized even though they may technically be a -- an investment in the technical and legal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.620" offset="2557889">Unlike a bank deposit, these accounts -- through dividends, they're compounded usually on a quarterly basis by the savings and loan association.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.071" offset="2607626">A bank account on the other hand since 1933 has born no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.792" offset="2634585">For what it may be worth, the Internal Revenue Service regards these dividends paid by savings and loan associations as interest and requires them to be so treated on the internal revenue returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.041" offset="2699577">And I should also point out insofar as interest itself is concerned, that in the Lawrence case, well, there was no interest accruing on the bank deposit that were there involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.612" offset="2745866">The Court went out of its way to indicate that it did not suggest that the mere allowance of interest would destroy or terminate the immunity that would otherwise attach to the benefit moneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.415" offset="2805008">There are of course other differences that need be recognized insofar as in distinguishing a savings account from a checking account, that is of course that since the accountable requires a share interest in the capital, he has at least a technical right to vote for the management of the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.159" offset="2899989">This I would question is -- is a -- a right that is often exercised due to the magnitude of the -- and prevalence of the existing associations and the millions and millions of depositors that do have an interest in these accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.392" offset="2988910">Further difference between the checking account and the savings account is that the checking account is always subject to the depositor's draft whereas under the governing regulations of federal savings and loan associations, the depositor may be required to wait 30 days for his money for -- for a redemption of his shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.914" offset="3087026">This, we submit, is like the interest distinction between savings accounts and bank accounts and in substantial one and should not defeat the immunity that otherwise would attach to these funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.448" offset="3161213">In the share -- in a share of -- of ordinary corporate stock, Justice Harlan I think it will be controlled probably by your decision in Carrier v.

          <turn speaker="john_g_laughlin_jr" startTime="783.620" stopTime="1068.159">
            <label>Mr. John G. Laughlin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="783.620" offset="3237804">It would not be -- it would lose -- the exemption would terminate with the purchase of the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.299" offset="3260583">This to our mind comports more consistently with the investment concept as it was first announced in the Trotter case and subsequently, articulated in Lawrence v. Shaw and coming to this, the negotiable securities so held in Carrier v. Bryant.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.639" offset="3353893">And it is the -- it is the investment aspect that we do not deny exist in this case but we suggest that a rigid or mechanical approach to the solution to the question here involved by a determination of whether this is a dictionary, or in a legal sense, an investment that we would have to concede it is but this should not so bind the Court that it would defeat the otherwise manifest intent of -- of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.733" offset="3482311">This was the approach taken by the District Court and I suggest the approach that the majority of the Court of Appeals took.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.452" offset="3521181">At the same time, the Court did recognize that the purpose of these benefits and of the immunity statute was to assure the availability of these funds for the maintenance and support of the -- of veterans on the case of a deceased veteran, his widow or his children.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.898" offset="3606967">The distinction that the Court of Appeals found was that by reason of the fact that the Veterans Committee here first deposited these funds in a checking account which was of course immune and then at subsequent periods as the funds accumulated, he transferred them into the two savings and loan association substantial amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.714" offset="3718248">Our view of -- of this aspect of the holding below is that it is an -- an unduly narrow and restrictive approach to the concept of maintenance and support as it presently has come to be in this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.037" offset="3787525">To be sure the sums paid out in many instances are very modest and would permit of no substantial setting aside of amounts in either a bank account or a savings account.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.573" offset="3853667">But we think that the prudent recipient of these invest -- or these benefits should not be required to keep them on this person if he's able to set aside a little bit every month or under his roof or in a checking account that should be entitled or should have available to him the modesty income that these savings association accounts provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.725" offset="3954291">They are in every sense as -- as liquid and asset as in a practical sense as the deposit in a bank because of the record here and has been pointed out by the Court of Appeals, the -- shows the funds while subject to a 30-day withdrawal period or nonetheless, in a practical sense available on demand must -- the same as a deposit in a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.127" offset="4079888">So these purposes that I have -- that the Court recognized but be limited because it felt that the maintenance of a checking account and the conversion of some of the funds into the savings account, indicated that these were surplus funds over and above the needs and necessities of the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.744" offset="4182392">We suggest in our brief that this is an unduly narrow and restrictive view of present day needs and point out that school, schooling for children, taxes, debt, an automobile or a home are probably -- properly in the present day and the age considered as a maintenance and support or as of the -- as a necessity of present day life and that to deprive these funds once they are deposited in the savings association of this immunity to that extent tends to defeat the purpose of that Congress had in mind in extending the immunity to these provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.618" offset="4389804">Of the deposits, something less than $9000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.708" offset="4402239">There's $5759 in one account and $3078 in -- in the second account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.199" offset="4428152">But that Mr. Justice Harlan includes two dividends to the to the time of judgment and of course as the District Court held and that no one questioned the dividends as the crew are not within the ambit of -- of the statutory immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.326" offset="4504639">I think one brief word on the part of the Government is an order as with respect to the Wisconsin Bankers case since respondent suggest that the position that the Government take here and that it took in that case is someone inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.553" offset="4577573">The Wisconsin Bankers case was an attack upon the Home Loan Bank Board and the charge being that it was by its regulations permitting these savings accounts and savings deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.475" offset="4629295">Well as authorizing saving and loan associations to engage unlawfully in the business of banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.650" offset="4665971">We took the position in that case that by reason of the technical legal distinction between a -- a savings depositor in a savings and loan association and a depositor in a savings account in the bank that the -- and the fact that the depositors and the associations acquire an interest in the capital of the association, took it beyond the proscription in the statute against savings and loan associations accepting demand deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.928" offset="4811107">And we do not say that the deposits here are demand of others in a sense that they are in a commercial bank and subject to draft in any sense but that the -- even though they are, as a practical matter, subject to withdraw on demand, they are nonetheless subject to a possible waiting period and as I've earlier indicated that the distinction is really a practical significance only in the event of some economic emergency, it should befall the savings and loan association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.932" offset="4971081">One other point that I would like to suggest here, and that is that these savings and loan associations in the present day number on an excess of 6300; they have 6300 throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.799" offset="5042552">They have deposits that run an excess of 62 billion dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.025" offset="5067421">The public, I suggest distinguishes between these and a commercial bank only in terms of the rate of interest they are able to receive from the savings and loan association but cannot receive through a bank either checking account or a savings account in a commercial bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.856" offset="5138787">They come to regard them as a convenient and a secure institution whereby they can take dollars saved and on a systematic or whatever basis they can; set their money aside, assured in the belief that with federal insurance up to $10,000 they run no risk and that as a practical matter in the present day and as it has been for years and years, these funds are immediately available for whatever emergency or whatever need may arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.839" offset="5286745">We think that consistent with the public understanding of these institutions and the insubstantiality of the distinctions between these accounts and those that the Court or the account that the Court was concerned with in Lawrence v. Shaw that the ruling of Shaw case should carry over unto this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.802" offset="5442539">We differ -- the Government's position as to what is the distinguishing criteria which terminates the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.028" offset="5507532">We say that it is the only thing which is exempted is the payment of benefit and when the moneys, be it still in the form of money or whether it be transferred into some other form, bank account shares or any other forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.632" offset="5581928">When it ceases to have the character of a payment, it has lost its exemption because that exemption was only extended by the statute to the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.202" offset="5624142">But the Government would read that that benefits acquired from the payment of veterans' disability checks shall be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.221" offset="5684224">I do not read the statute in that like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.207" offset="5704182">I would think we should approach this case on the basis of the record made in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.530" offset="5749530">In that record, we were dealing only with two building -- one building and loan account and one savings and loan account for the purposes of our considerations that there is no distinction in the building and loan and the savings and loan account, they're governed by the same author; same regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.892" offset="5834898">We are not dealing here with a systematic deposit of the veterans' benefit checks in a certain account or in the accounts which were attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.998" offset="5895398">The record will show from the Committee's account which appears at page 15 of the record and on some of the following pages that the regular monthly disability checks in the amount of $225 were systematically deposited in the national bank checking account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.713" offset="6010232">An account not here before the Court which was attached but as to which we are raising no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.619" offset="6045863">The Committee's account further shows that at various times but on no fixed pattern, funds were transferred from that account in a lump sum $3000 in one case, $2000 in other and $1000 figures in others, incidentally, figures which are not consistent with an accumulation only of the payments or rather a payment deficit divisible into that sum which it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.602" offset="6185775">But those funds were transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.624" offset="6201866">When they reached the hands of the garnishee where they were attached, they were not payments of veterans' benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.264" offset="6240423">They were a payment from the veterans' checking account and were an investment by the veterans who bought the accrual of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.181" offset="6272084">Indeed, one item with $2000 had been withdrawn from the building and loan account, placed back in the checking account in anticipation of the -- of its use for payments of expert witnesses at the trial and then when that was -- this necessity was dispensed with, it was again transferred to the building and loan account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.841" offset="6366751">Could it be said that that transfer of that $2000 back again to the building and loan account and not -- it then still retained as a character as the payment which had been an exempted and we submit that it could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.432" offset="6433102">The distinction between the relationships between depositors in building and loan accounts and the relationship between depositors and checking accounts and bank -- and bank accounts of the checking account nature is a substantial and real one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.052" offset="6511574">And in order to accomplish the results sought by the Government and by the petitioner in this case, it is necessary to rewrite the contract which was entered into between of the person who deposited -- the veteran who deposited -- deposited the funds in a building and loan or savings and loan account and -- and that institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.195" offset="6608123">To carry that argument; the Government's argument and the petitioner's argument to its logical extension would not only rewrite the account for the benefit of the veteran and at the prejudice of the building and loan or savings and loan association but would also provide the means of a shop an unfair and an equitable discrimination between those depositors in the building and loan organizations who were veterans and those who were not because if you are to exempt those funds from attachment by a judgment creditors, you would necessarily have to exempt them from any other form of execution described in the statute either equitable or legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.762" offset="6790457">So, I think we all know that all building and loan associations are not federally insured or are not properly managed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.747" offset="6838314">Some have come into difficulties and some in this immediate area are even now in the hands of receivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.725" offset="6866317">The Government's position would require that depositors in that account in those associ -- associations would be treated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.432" offset="6909053">Veterans' accounts would be exempt but the other depositors would have to bear the full burden of any loss because if the veterans accounted the exempt from attachment by a judgment creditor, it would be exempt from seizure by the receiver or the -- the referee in bankruptcy or any other person seeking to enforce and carry out the liquidation or the salvation of that company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.849" offset="7046771">I would like to deal for a moment with the Government's argument for the widows and children as I understood it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.496" offset="7105390">At page 17 of their brief that Mr. Laughlin has argued, urges that a woman receiving widow's benefit on the veterans legislation must keep those moneys perhaps intended as a source of maintenance and independence in later life either on her person or under her rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.609" offset="7173831">The same type of an argument was made with respect to a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.621" offset="7185847">I submit that that is vicious argument that you do not find in the statute, any intention to exempt anything except the payment that the statute -- it has a limited duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.874" offset="7234853">I find nothing in the statute which says that a veteran or a veteran's widow or a veterans' child could live on credit putting the veteran's payments in a building and loan account and the judgment proof for necessities bought on credit that would follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.514" offset="7321475">The Government states that its position here is consistent with that taken in the Wisconsin Bankers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.692" offset="7386154">I do not concede that that is the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.770" offset="7426487">I say in their brief in his case, that the only real difference between a savings account depositor and here we do not have a savings account depositor but I -- I -- our position would be the same in any event and the checking account depositor are that the former draw the little interest or dividend on his account and has to present his passbook.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.968" offset="7511228">These minimal differences are not, we submit, sufficient to deprive benefits proceeds of their identity when placed in a savings account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.704" offset="7550203">Again at page 25, they say the differences between these two types of accounts, however, are technical and legal and are far outweighed by their similarities when the issue is viewed in the perspec -- perspective of the benign legislative purpose of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.768" offset="7614464">However, in arguing the Congress with the position which they take here in their brief on -- an -- an objection to the application for certiorari in the Wisconsin Bankers case, they say, at page 7 of their brief in that case, “From these regulatory provisions, it is clear that whatever their similarities in name and practice and practical operations of the savings accounts authorized by the regulations are not the legal counterpart of a deposit in a bank and the relationship of holders to those savings accounts to the association is significantly different from the debtor-creditor relationship that exist between a depositor and a bank.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.730" offset="7778304">They go on to say at the footer that same page, “Unlike petitioners, depositors however, are members of an association holding savings account paid for a share of capital that Section 5 (b) require and though they may withdraw their interest, they are subject to a waiting period as well as a proration of funds in the event of an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.684" offset="7862105">They are share owners not depositors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.725" offset="7878301">In concluding, they say our position is that the challenge regulations create procedures and legal interest significantly different in legal contemplation from the type of deposits proscribed by Section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.554" offset="7997628">This Court denied certiorari in the Wisconsin Bankers case, after the opposition by the Government had granted its appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.000" offset="8095326">The Home Owners' Regulations had clearly set forth the legal effects of the relationships between the depositors; be they veteran or non-veteran and be they veteran incompetent or veterans who are competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.716" offset="8174216">They set them forth clearly and they specified that they are owners of share; benefit share, share interest; a capital interest in the organization.</text>
