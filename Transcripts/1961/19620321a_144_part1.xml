            <text syncTime="38.144" offset="255979">Mr. Shannon.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bob E. Shannon</label>
            <text syncTime="48.400" offset="296939">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.899" offset="306970">This Court grants certiorari to the Third Court of Civil Appeals in Texas back in October of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.070" offset="339675">That Court of Civil Appeals had held a provision of the Texas Insurance Code invalid as a violation of the Due Process Clause of Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.538" offset="385546">That provision is Section 2 (e) of Article 2138 of the Insurance Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.615" offset="425880">This provision simply lays a 5% tax upon the premiums paid by a person owning taxes risks who insures those taxes risks with unauthorized insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.882" offset="482931">Now, an unauthorized insurance company is simply a company not licensed to do business in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.068" offset="511666">The respondent here contracted for an unauthorized insurance outside the State of Texas, paid the tax under protest and brought suit in the District Court of Travis County to recover the payments of these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.525" offset="573524">The Travis County Court held that the respondent should recover, the State been appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals sitting in Austin and as stated, that court held on the basis of the Allgeyer holding in the St. Louis Cotton Compress holding that it was a violation of federal due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.895" offset="646980">Then the State applied to the Texas Supreme Court for an application for writ of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.343" offset="676760">The Texas Supreme Court refused to grant the application and in a per curiam opinion noted that it refused to do so because of a holding of this Court in the Allgeyer case and in the St. Louis Cotton Compress case.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.608" offset="741752">The question presented to this Court is whether or not Texas may regulate a licensed -- a corporation which is licensed to do business in Texas, who is insuring Texas property at risks with an unauthorized company when the formalities of the contract were made outside Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.629" offset="829837">The statement of facts were primarily stipulated in the trial court and I may simply and I believe rather rapidly cover them.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.219" offset="872260">The respondent is a foreign corporation, a New York Corporation in fact but it has done business in Texas since 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.239" offset="908309">It owns property and his plants in Galveston and Houston Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.544" offset="933595">This property is by -- it's somewhere in the neighborhood of $900,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.079" offset="951672">At these plants, it employs about 1500 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.575" offset="965674">In fact, the total volume of business of the respondent amounts to about 27%.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.797" offset="990542">That is done in Texas over its overall operations over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.603" offset="1029831">Now, on this property, certain insurance and on these other risks, certain insurance was purchased with these unauthorized companies in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.943" offset="1075179">Now, the insurance was purchased from two English companies and it is stipulated and admitted in the record that these companies are not authorized insurance companies that they do not submit to any regulation in any form or any fashion to the Texas State Board of Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.246" offset="1164309">Now, as I stated a moment ago, the contracts themselves were negotiated for, premiums were paid, the contracts were made outside of Texas and New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.190" offset="1212165">In fact, in the contracts themselves, which appear in the record, it is stated that as between the insured, that is Todd, and as between the insurance company, it could be considered that the contracts were made in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.456" offset="1293145">And one from this brief resume of facts, there are several points which could -- the petitioner feels that are important and would like to bring to attention of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.056" offset="1347584">One that -- that Todd is a foreign company but it has licensed itself to do business in Texas since 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.929" offset="1379140">And that Todd did purchase the insurance from unauthorized companies that the tax in question, Section 2 (e), places the tax on the insured, that is, the people who are buying the insurance and add up on the insurance company which admittedly has not submitted itself to the regulation by Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.221" offset="1472240">At this time, I think it -- it's important that the Section 2 (e) or of Article 2138 be briefly examined and the purpose of the background of statute going into.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.702" offset="1534203">Petitioners feel that the purpose of the tax in question is primarily regulatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.941" offset="1559176">It is helpful in understanding the tax to know something about the background of insurance regulation in Texas to see where this particular tax fits into regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.267" offset="1624482">Prior to 1876, there was no insurance regulation in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.710" offset="1646216">Unfortunately, the era is well-known as one in which the insurance business did frankly what it was -- what it wished to do and there were situations for a frequent failures, financial failures by the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.970" offset="1715284">In many cases in that period, the officials of the insurance companies conducted themselves more or less for -- and conducted the companies more or less for their own benefit rather than for the benefit of stockholders of the companies or for the policy holders of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.311" offset="1784665">In this period also, it was problem of discriminatory rates between certain insured companies and insurers.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.666" offset="1842030">-- by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.508" offset="1849448">In 1876, the legislature did pass an act setting up a state department of insurance and from that date, down to the present, it has passed various laws which comprehensively regulate the whole of the insurance business in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.159" offset="1928025">The present regulatory bodies called the State Board of Insurance and they exercise, as I say, a fairly comprehensive control over the insurance done by licensed companies in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.302" offset="1992600">A few examples of the kinds of regulations which were imposed by the State Board or the fact that minimum capital and surplus are required to be met, that the company's license do business in Texas come into Texas and submit themselves to examination by examiner by the State Board of Insurance that these companies submit annual statements of their financial condition, that a certain kinds of insurance rates are prescribed by the Board and other kinds of insurance policy forms are even prescribed on the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.300" offset="2136586">Now, these regulations are few and these among many others set a minimum standard of performance for insurance companies which operate lawfully in Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.876" offset="2470849">Actually, it tends to end the encouragement to persons owning risks in Texas from going outside the companies which are licensed in Texas to purchase insurance because of placing a tax on these transactions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bob E. Shannon</label>
            <text syncTime="610.133" offset="2543888">In effect, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.348" offset="2576802">As I have stated a moment ago, the purpose of the tax is primarily regulatory and this is revealed in the first section of 21-2038 which is the purpose clause and stated as follows, The legislature declares that it is the subject and concern that the placing of such direct lines of insurance with an unauthorized insurance companies is not properly regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.812" offset="2682650">As I stated a moment ago, 2138 does several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.252" offset="2700413">In Section 2 -- or subsection (a), (b), (c), and (d), it sets up a means by which persons owning risks in Texas may purchase insurance from unauthorized companies if they will go through specially licensed agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.991" offset="2771362">Now, these agents on under certain categories and they -- they must pass certain -- certain test before they can provide this sort of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.534" offset="2809501">Also, the agent pays a 5% tax upon the gross premiums taken upon these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.251" offset="2840325">And Section 2 (e) which is under consideration before this Court, the -- is in effect a tax which is used as a regulation to -- as Mr. Justice said a moment ago to in effect, lessen the advantage of these -- of Texas people owning Texas risks to go outside the state and purchase insurance from unauthorized companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.934" offset="2963101">Now, under the tax -- under the tax, it is the person purchasing the insurance that pays the tax and not the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.266" offset="3000404">And as I stated a moment ago, the unauthorized insurer is not one licensed by the State Board of Insurance and could be one of several kinds of insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.094" offset="3043767">It could be a non-licensed insurance company of a foreign country or it could be a non-licensed insurance company of another state or for that matter, it could be a domestic company which had not complied in all respects with the regulations of State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.943" offset="3115133">Now, the effect of this tax and the regulatory effect is that it lessens the advantage formally enjoyed to unauthorized insurers and that they could insure insurance property in Texas at a lower cost and could companies which would come into Texas and submit themselves to regulation by the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="811.581" offset="3349713">The other effect of the regulation is that it tends to equalize the burdens of the regulatory burden among all the risks in the State prior to Section 2 (e) only those risks which were insured with authorized companies for the cost of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.955" offset="3435186">However, it's subsequent to the passage of the tax, all of these taxes risks more important because of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.935" offset="3471130">As I stated a moment ago, the Court of Civil Appeals found in or based its opinion upon the Allgeyer case and the St.Louis Cotton Compress case.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.926" offset="3511045">These cases in effect held that a state was powerless to regulate contracts of insurance own risks within the State if the formalities of the contract were made outside the State's borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.330" offset="3576665">It was said in those cases that this was a violation of the liberty of contract and as such was a violation of the federal due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.896" offset="3622954">Since 1897, when the Allgeyer case was decided and at later points, this case has been criticized and questioned invalid by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.955" offset="3671228">Specifically, in the area of labor legislation, this case had been used to curtail the power of various states to regulate working conditions within the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.270" offset="4664404">However, the Court said that in determining the power of state to regulate that the conceptualistic approach employed in the Allgeyer line of cases no longer was to be employed but instead recognize that a court might have a substantial -- that a state might have a substantial interest in the insurance of persons located within that state or property located within that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.212" offset="4776208">The interest in the regulation could be measured by such realistic considerations as protection of the citizen involved or the protection of the State from incidents of loss.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.698" offset="6410115">Your Honor, I will now go into the Texas interest in the insurance contracts involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.201" offset="6440208">One of the interests involved is the fact that the risks are located here and the cases, the Osborn case and in the Hoopeston case, both these cases emphasize -- emphasized a fact that the risks were located in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.741" offset="6514291">Now, these risks are substantial risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.208" offset="6524217">They're not few bales of cotton as in the Allgeyer case which were mainly shipped out and left the confines of Louisiana but these will remain in Texas for the -- for the most part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.617" offset="6581791">Another factor is the fact that the insured that is the respondent here is located in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.898" offset="6614915">In case of failure or the inability of casualty company to pay for large casualty loses, some 1500 -- certain economic consequences would be sure to be felt by the State of Texas, some 1500 people would more or less be unemployed if the Todd Shipyards Corporation offices there were closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.483" offset="6701328">State agencies would be caught upon the supply relief in that situation and of course loss of purchasing power would have adverse effect on the business community in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.585" offset="6761723">Another important factor is Your Honor that the events which give rise to contractual obligation to pay on these policies will more than likely to occur in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.358" offset="6800802">In case of some of the insurances involved, persons compensated will be residents of Texas and they will be resorting to Texas courts more than likely unless they wish to resort to distant forums which would cause a great deal of trouble and expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.983" offset="6879274">The people having a claim under the liabilicy -- liability policies here would be treated in Texas hospitals by Texas doctors and unless reimbursed by insurance may well become more of the state or dependence upon residents of Texas to take care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.867" offset="6958791">Also, the State does extend police protection to the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.105" offset="6971747">It makes it possible for the respondent to carry on a profitable business in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.473" offset="7001213">Texas, I feel also has the vital interest in the effective enforcement of its regulatory program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2563.735" offset="10358262">Todd does operate a Texas shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.076" offset="10367666">It does do a -- a business in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.207" offset="10380204">Now, these cases that involve the -- the jurisdictional boundaries between the State's right to tax and where it may not rightfully tax, come up here to this Court in two basic postures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.637" offset="10437883">And it's important to make this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.203" offset="10452198">The State in this case has personal jurisdiction over Todd Shipyards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.530" offset="10477484">Todd Shipyards is doing business in the State at which is clearly admitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2618.883" offset="10578944">Now, the case has come up here in another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.680" offset="10590124">They come up where the company like Lloyds is not in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.731" offset="10614262">Clearly not doing business in the State and the State seeks to reach that company on the grounds of transactions within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.045" offset="10659506">If suit were brought against Lloyds, they would be trying to reach Lloyds through a Texas transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.062" offset="10687613">In this case, they admit the case reached Lloyds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.226" offset="10700257">They admit Lloyds don't have a Texas transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.757" offset="10710392">They're not trying to project their power to Lloyds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.418" offset="10725021">They're trying to take the personal jurisdiction that they have over this foreign corporation and project it to an extraterritorial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.092" offset="10763786">And -- and those are two different postures in which the case has come up here and sometimes, the rules are not altogether harmonious unless that distinction is made between projecting from personal jurisdiction to an out of state transaction and trying to get the jurisdiction to a transaction in the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.125" offset="11079868">It's also patently clear in this case that when the State admits that they can't reach Lloyds, they -- they virtually admit Texas has no jurisdiction of this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.632" offset="11129919">If Tex -- if this was a Texas insurance contract, if Texas has this vital interest that the state suggest then Lloyd would be amenable to Texas regulation and they could reach out under the Scripto in similar cases and reach Lloyds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.753" offset="11190418">They take an inconsistent position when they say they -- when they admit they cannot reach Lloyds and when they say but at the same time, we can tax what you do with Lloyd in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.554" offset="11233573">If these were a Texas transaction, if Texas had this jurisdictional nexus, if they have the jurisdictional connection, they could bring Lloyds under the regulatory authority of the State of Texas.</text>
