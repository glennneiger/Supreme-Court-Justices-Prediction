            <text syncTime="43.857" offset="278758">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.982" offset="295267">This case arises out of a suit for refund of federal income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.048" offset="315538">Petitioner C.J.D. Rudolph works in Dallas as an ordinary life insurance agent for Southland Life Insurance Company, a major insurance company whose offices are also in Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.331" offset="364648">In 1956, he and his wife attended a convention of Southland agents and officers in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.387" offset="392965">And their transportation, accommodations and their meals were arranged and paid for by Southland.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.955" offset="423163">The basic issues involved in this case are first, whether or not the amount of convention expense allocable to petitioners which has been stipulated by the parties to be $560 is to be includable in their gross income and if that question be answered in the affirmative whether petitioners are to be allowed an ordinary and necessary business expense deduction for an equivalent amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.209" offset="528175">Respondent contends that the convention trip was a bonus to petitioners and therefore his income and that their expenses were primarily personal and therefore not deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.597" offset="573733">We contend that petitioners were taken to New York by Southland for business reasons without regard to compensation and that the cost attributable to their trip are not income to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.886" offset="618872">Alternatively, we contend that if they are charged with income, the expenditures thereby imputed to them were incurred for ordinary and necessary business reasons and are therefore deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.560" offset="677595">Once every year and a half for the past 20 years or more, Southland has sponsored a convention of the type involved here to which it invites certain of its agents and their wives and the top officers of the company and their wives.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.722" offset="762232">The agents invited to attend are selected on the basis of their having sold or prescribed minimum amount of insurance, which the company believes as the most appropriate standard for determining who has an aptitude for the business and who had benefit from the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.933" offset="823150">When an agent is invited to attend, both the agent and the company believes that it is part of his responsibility and a part of his job to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.752" offset="882395">The 1956 convention activities lasted approximately one week of which about four days were spent traveling on trains, chartered trains to and from New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.595" offset="925759">They spent about two days in New York, Friday and Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.859" offset="942791">Friday morning was devoted to a formal program of speeches by the top officers of Southland to a panel discussion of agents and several lecturers on the agency program.</text>

            <text syncTime="573.543" offset="2397497">We believe that that these principles now have to be refined as they are applied to two things which occur everyday on our business community.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.112" offset="2427800">First, the company convention and second the compulsion or the coercion by employers upon their employees that the employees participate and what the employer believes to be a legitimate and necessary business activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.802" offset="2482552">If we're correct in interpreting this need, then the responsibilities of the trial court in this case should be restricted to their narrowest sphere not expanded as the respondent would do to the utmost which might in some other circumstances be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.321" offset="2552665">With the law governing a tax controversy is undefined and particularly where the principles of law involved are far-reaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.930" offset="2587042">And the trial court has drawn inferences from the undisputed evidentiary facts or has decided ultimate facts which are dispositive of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.366" offset="2628838">Then we submit that this Court or indeed any appellate court shouldn't hesitate to exercise its broadest powers of review because the danger is great that the trial judge may have approached his job without knowledge or consideration of the applicable law or even worst that his understanding of the applicable law may have been erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.062" offset="2727581">And that's exactly what happened in this case we believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="663.446" offset="2757151">But we also believe that such findings were predicated on an error of law resulting either from mistake in interpreting the governing legal principles or the failure to recognize that those legal principles even existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.416" offset="2817024">In either event, we submit that this Court should not now restrict its reviews simply to determine whether or not the fact findings of the District Court are clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.128" offset="2859865">In our opinion, the error of the District Court is apparent since he indicated that he wasn't concerned with the purpose of Southland in holding the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.006" offset="2895391">And if it please the Court, I should like to quote very briefly from the record, on page 79 in the District Court's opinion towards the bottom of the page he states, "It is the purpose of the convention to the taxpayers which governs our action, not the purpose of the insurance company in holding them.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.078" offset="2979715">Yet, this would seem to be the single most important determination in the case."</text>
            <text syncTime="724.557" offset="3001553">And as respondent apparently agrees with us in his brief, and if my indulge the Court once more to quote from respondent's brief at page 11 he states, "Both parties are -- agreed that the relevant ultimate facts upon which the legal questions in this case turned are (a) the reasons why the company sponsored and paid for the trip, and (b) the reasons why petitioner and his wife took the trip offered by the company, and it slightly regard to the (b) part of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.185" offset="3128090">He suggest elsewhere in his brief at page 28 that the purpose of Southland in holding a convention is vital and important in determining the purpose of the petitioners in attending.</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.028" offset="4415509">The dominant business purpose of his employer was the reason why he took the trip in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.056" offset="4435571">The trip wasn't intended as compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.614" offset="4445811">And his only gain was the subjective pleasure which he may or may not have experienced by virtue of his position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1112.141" offset="4551973">So our position on the income side of the case is that there are limited exceptions to gross income other than those specifically enumerated in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.071" offset="4595649">And we state this board recognizing full well the perva -- the pervasive characters brought to gross income by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.569" offset="4625638">For it seems to us that those very decisions which established that broad character also recognized intrinsically that not every things received by a tax gain, not every gain in a classical economic sense constitutes income too.</text>

            <text syncTime="1172.500" offset="4793344">Now, we believe that this rational and the law of governing the hypothesis which I posed is entirely consistent with the Court's decision in Commissioner versus Smith that compensation in whatever form constitutes income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.576" offset="4853635">And we think it's also consistent with Commissioner versus Glenshaw Glass Company wherein the Court noted that the damages received for fraud or any trust violations resulted in undeniable accessions to wealth clearly realized and over which the tax per head complete dominion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.035" offset="4923538">That the trip taken by the employee in my hypothesis wasn't intended his compensation nor did he clearly realize any benefit, any accession to wealth over which he had dominion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.799" offset="4970559">He's actions were governed and controlled by the dominant business purpose of his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.692" offset="4990098">We believe that petitioner stand in basically the same shoes as the employee in my hypothesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.267" offset="5024475">The only distinction being that they were personally involved in the business purpose of a company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.297" offset="5048508">Thus, an effort must be made to isolate that business purpose from a simple intent to compensate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.076" offset="5071705">But once it can be established as we believe the uncontroverted testimony as established here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.611" offset="5093857">That the dominant motive and reason for the company sponsoring the convention was its own business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.886" offset="5118934">That the convention was germane to that purpose based upon long standing interest, industry-wide experience and that there was no intent to compensate petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.522" offset="5157491">And it seems clear to us that they received nothing which it constituted income, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.877" offset="5178911">Our position on the expense side of the case is similar too because we believe that the same basic facts that support an exclusion from gross income also when turned around confirmed the presence of ordinary and necessary business expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.343" offset="5240769">The trial court ignored Southland's business purpose in holding the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.695" offset="5258115">It ignored the compulsion upon the petitioners to attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.925" offset="5271071">It ignored the relationship between the convention and petitioners own business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.123" offset="5291865">Instead, the court apparently looked only to the outward or extrinsic appearances of the convention in holding contrary to every bit of the oral testimony that the convention was in the nature of a vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.403" offset="5344946">In the phase of what would seem the obvious, an overwhelming relationship between the convention and the agent, this would be exceedingly difficult to understand except for the trial judge's own admission that he wasn't concerned with the business purpose of Southland in holding the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.410" offset="5424985">Now, respondent attempts to justify this fact conclusion on the basis of two erroneous legal premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.873" offset="5450898">First, he compares the times spent at the formal program on Friday morning with the total period covered by the convention as if this were conclusive of a non-business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.440" offset="5497083">The error in this approach is two fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.106" offset="5507845">It assumes first that informal activity at a convention cannot have a business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.450" offset="5529161">But the management of Southland testified that the program was expressly designed to permit the agents and the officers to mix and mingle together in an informal atmosphere and that the exchange of ideas occurring in this manner probably was the most important business benefit of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.897" offset="5594990">Shoptalk at a convention is a part of the business of a convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.298" offset="5612544">And it need not be conducted in an auditorium to be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.256" offset="5628426">In the second place, respondent's comparative analysis treats the travel time to and from New York as being a sterile thing which gain its tax character solely from the activities at the convention site but this couldn't be further from the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.286" offset="5692479">Southland intentionally chartered special trainings on which it required the agents and the officers to travel together so that they would have an opportunity with little else to do to talk about the insurance business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.325" offset="5748694">We believe therefore that the -- that the travel itself had an independent business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.828" offset="5774712">If we had the travel time to the formal time of the program, we have four-and-a-half days spent in strictly businesses compared to one-and-a-half days in informal activities which we also think have legitimate business purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.138" offset="5831973">So, on the basis of respondent's own promise is that each expense should be deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.582" offset="5853706">His next error is an ignoring the company's insistence that Rudolph and his wife attend the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.844" offset="5878784">We believe it's legally significant when an employer required that an employee participate in what the employer in good faith believes to be a necessary business activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.935" offset="5927163">What is the employee to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.158" offset="5936044">What should any hardheaded business man do except to comply with the request of his employer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.410" offset="5961017">Sure, he couldn't argue with his employer about whether or not the convention bore a sufficient business relationship to his own business to warrant his attending particularly where this has been an industry-wide practice for 30 years or more.</text>
