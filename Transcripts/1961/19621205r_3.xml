            <text syncTime="12.281" offset="154582">In considering the government's basic argument that this is a statute, which has a relationship to the far relations power of the government and that it does not imposed any punishment, one might be well to consider the Mr. Justice Frankfurter's remarks in his reflections on the reading of statutes, that in considering the construction of a statute, we might begin by reading it.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.752" offset="288434">And if one does read Section 21, of the Act of March 3, 1865, the progenitor of both the draft desertion, the draft evasions and the desertion provision, one sees that they have a common origin, a common purpose and common sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.759" offset="392505">In fact, Section 21 contains in the very same sentence, not merely the same section, the provisions with respect to draft evasion and desertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.071" offset="445691">Now the statute itself, which again we must look at, is a statute which provides, which is described as an act to amend the several acts herein after passed, to provide for the enrolling and calling out of the national forces and for other purposes, nothing to do with foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.065" offset="533671">It is composed of 27 sections, all of which deal with different aspects of running an army and the question --</text>

            <text syncTime="122.482" offset="595320">I think running an army had something to do with the question that the statute dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.537" offset="615591">In short it is conceivable that a statute could contain the provisions relating to foreign relations, even though when army measure, but this particular one, I answer Your Honor in this way, this particular statute dealt only with the question of how to run the economy internally.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.546" offset="771594">The 1865 statute, exactly, and Your Honors will see and I think the briefs and other cases have indicated that the history isn't unbroken one except at one point where they left out the draft desertion provisions, the draft evasion provisions in 1940.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.113" offset="837841">Exactly Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.563" offset="843692">Now as I said Mr. Justice Goldberg, if you take the sections, one of them will deal for example with the question of bounties, another will deal with the question of soldier's pay, the third with a prohibition against allowing insane people to be inducted in the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.076" offset="913701">Nothing at all suggesting the government's present argument, and somehow rather in 1865 there was a conception of what our relations were going to be with other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.450" offset="951212">Now I will come to the government's arguments on that point in greater detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.994" offset="969394">Now the particular section of course that we're dealing with here has three subtitles, two of them are significant; penalty for desertion, et cetera; and leaving the country to avoid the draft to incur like penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.288" offset="1050582">Now the debates on the subject, which I don't think have been discussed before this Court before, likewise indicate a concern for enrolling in army and not a concern for what will happen if somebody leaves the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.649" offset="1108052">The Bill itself was proposed by Mr. Schenck, Chairman of the Military Committee, Representative from Ohio and Mr. Schenck's remarks, it was an emergency Bill I may say, in which they had very short debate, and which people who opposed the Bill were called traitors, Mr. Schenck stated, “Here is a penalty that is lawful, wise, proper and it should be added to the other lawful penalties that now exists against deserters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="280.878" offset="1228946">And as the Bill was originally introduced it merely referred to people leaving the country, but Congressman Wilson of Iowa, which I gather was a state with hills in it, moved to amend the Bill by providing that anybody who left the district, not merely the country, should be covered by this statute and as he said, “In my own state, and I presume it is so in all the states, as soon as that notice is given, that is a notice of induction, many persons at once prepare to leave and do leave, going into the territories and among the mountains and mines to avoid the services of a country in the event that they are being drafted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="333.244" offset="1438448">Well, mountains and mines in Iowa and the relating area is certainly a far cry from Mexico or Czechoslovakia or England, which the government is emphasizing in the present time.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="344.803" offset="1484633">That was quite a different statute that's what you're telling us.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.180" offset="1494141">That was a statute -- but that is exactly the same statute that we have today, except we have eliminated the words the district, that's merely a formulation of words.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="355.040" offset="1525593">Well it seems to me if I may suggest so and suggest to you that there is quite a good deal of difference between leaving the district and leaving this nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.325" offset="1562687">If they were Your Honor, any reference at all in any of the debates that followed to indicate that this wasn't merely a streamlining of the statute, then I would have to recognize some weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.804" offset="1608662">But there isn't a word in the period from 1865 to 1952 that suggests a different policy, and as a matter of fact the government itself in its brief in Gonzales against Landon, says that the purposes of the current statute are purposes of the 1865 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.349" offset="1678775">Now I would take them if they were there, as well as their construction which I rely on in another connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.561" offset="1703643">In the debate I may say in 1865 and a debate that followed, all the speakers emphasize the fact that this was a question of punishing people.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.805" offset="1736662">No suggestion made of any effect on foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.832" offset="1752754">In 1912 I think the most significant report is a report number 335 at the 62nd Congress, which is a report from the Committee on Naval Affairs, not foreign relations, in which they recommended that the statute be amended to be limited only to peace time.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.498" offset="1831434">And that there again the Chairman of the Committee pointed out, in using the words punishment and penalties, and I may say, cited from Winthrop's Military Law and Precedents in a letter from the Secretary of the Navy, in which Winthrop pointed out that this was a war measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.333" offset="1922759">No again, no suggestion that it would have had anything to do with foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.909" offset="1941044">In 1940, the Cabinet Committee's report was considered by the Congress and Your Honors will recall that the Cabinet Committee included on it the Secretary of State.</text>

            <text syncTime="876.218" offset="3610269">Yes it is Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.870" offset="3616852">Now the government, I will simply say without pressing the point further that the government refers to various problems arising on the war of 1812 and the problems for the North German States.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.183" offset="3678187">Those problems were quite different from those which led to the impact of 1865 and a careful reading of the remarks of the State Department papers will show those problems related to the question of American citizens who went aboard and who were pressed into the armies of the North German states in the 1850's and 1860's or in 1812 of course to our seamen were being pressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.569" offset="3783722">They had nothing whatsoever to do with the question, what would happen when people who were -- our draft delinquents went aboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.853" offset="3812874">And I will not take the time of the Court to refer the Court who I think has been misstated by commentators like Saing who was relied upon by the government, where they attempt to prove a connection between these problems with the North German states and the Act of 1865.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.587" offset="3879748">Those North German state problems were all dealt with in the Act of 1868, the Expatriation Act and in our treaties in the 1870s with the North German states, but they have no connection, except that they happen to be in approximately the same period with the statute with which we're now dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.590" offset="3947771">Now the government suggests that some how or other the possibility that there is flight aboard here or the fact there is flight aboard or in the case of Dr. Cort it wasn't one who flight aboard, it was remaining aboard, distinguishes this case from Trop.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.207" offset="4026243">I have only to refer the Court to the government's brief in Perez against Brownell, which is quoted at page 31 of my brief, where the Court said, in talking about the desertion and the draft evasion sections, “the reasons which sustained,” where the government said pardon me, “which sustained Section 401(j) also apply to the cognate Section 401(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.901" offset="4129061">Desertion in war time like draft evasion is a repudiation of the highest obligation of citizenship and involves kindred considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.334" offset="4166781">Subsection (g) does different from Subsection (j) in that it will meet the requirement of flight from this country or foreign residence, but the absence of this factor, said the government, does is not swing balance against constitutionality” and we agree of course with that position, at least that part, not the earlier part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.984" offset="4253403">Now there is a very real difference I may suggest between this case and Perez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.232" offset="4278376">It's true that in both cases and in numerous other cases people happen geographically to have been aboard, but geography is not the essence of Perez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.774" offset="4324561">As Your Honors will recall from the detailed opinion by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, it was not that Perez was in a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.770" offset="4360505">It was what Perez did in that foreign country that the majority of this Court regarded as having a bearing upon foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.555" offset="4403660">And the opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, although very respectfully we have differed from it on our brief here, is very precise, that Perez in remaining aboard and in voting aboard was actively doing something which was an interference with another country's internal affairs, although I think he had a right to as a dual national, and that, that interference might be attributed to the United States, that the United States would be regarded as the principal and Perez as the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.722" offset="4544303">Well, nobody would suggest in these cases that Mendoza-Martinez was the agent of the United States in remaining in Mexico or Dr. Cort in remaining aboard, in defiance as the government claims, of their obligations under the Selective Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.864" offset="4612848">And it is -- if we take the full meaning of Perez, the attribution to the United States Government of something, which might lead another government to resent it then of course this case is clearly distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.130" offset="4669900">Now the government's theory of the delinquency of obligations, which is the essence of its sovereignty point, as various members of Court have indicated and as prior counsel have indicated is a very dangerous doctrine, because where do you stop?</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.452" offset="4735206">What obligation of citizenship is it; that is to lead to the taking away of citizenship status itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.203" offset="4770210">Why do we have a system of punishments instead of a system of banishment in this country?</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.840" offset="4792780">And I remember hearing in this connection, just give one illustration, one of our finest District Court Judge's in the United States Judge Edward Weinfeld, talked once on the subject of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.115" offset="4845861">Judge Weinfeld said that in his view, a man who was most delinquent in his obligations of citizenship above all others was a man who has defrauded the government of taxes, because taxation was the sinuous of a government and that was the case where Judge Weinfeld, a very fair but very able judge imposed the most severe penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.255" offset="4946484">Now the illustrations, the manifold, there is not much point in my trying to be more ingenious than other counsel and the various members of the Court in illustrating where this is, where this ends, but I think it ends nowhere and it comes down to the whole problem with the conception of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.194" offset="5014194">I would suggest that we of course adhere to the basic principles laid down by the Chief Justice in the majority -- in the first section of his majority opinion in Trop and in his dissent in Perez, but we have not found it necessary in view of the time, I simply won't argue what is not the majority opinion of the Court on the question of the general power of the government in a case where there is “A rational nexus”, to take away citizenship, but the broader doctrine that somehow or other there exists a sovereign power in the government to take away from the people who intended to be sovereign, the citizens, their status this I think is an appalling doctrine, and the government has attempted to minimize here, the question of statelessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.210" offset="5222233">And I prefer to refer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's comments in one of the cases, I think it was in Trop where he pointed out -- where he pointed out that citizenship, the loss of citizenship has tragic consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.063" offset="5293704">While the Justice ameliorated the situation to some degree, no reflection of these tragic consequences is suggested in the government's brief and I would merely indicate a few things to the Court at the present time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.356" offset="11550866">If Mr. Cort should come back to the United States under the passport that he has been granted, of course he would be illegal entrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.593" offset="11587751">There would be no basis for contending that he was not a legal entrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.682" offset="11608127">Then if subsequently the District Court's decision should be overruled, should be reversed by this Court, there would be a question as to whether or not he could then be deported for any -- for being within an excludable class when he came into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.273" offset="11698510">Now that question has never been decided by any Court as far as we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.987" offset="11725364">It depends obviously on whether or not during the period of litigation the Supreme Court's final decision could have retroactive effect, and as I say that question is an open question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.846" offset="11780848">So there is the possibility that he could at that point be deported for having been within an excludable class when he entered, not for having entered illegally, but for having been within one of those classes and of course he would be within at least one excludable class.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. William Doolittle</label>
            <text syncTime="3169.800" offset="12784577">It was indicated that Mr. Cort had received a letter from the authorities at Harvard prior to his having received a notice from his draft board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.187" offset="12826164">Now in point of fact because of the problems of when letters reach one across oceans and so on, it is probable that a letter written by Harvard did reach Mr. Cort before his draft notice did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.150" offset="12893978">But in point of fact that letter from Harvard, what it said was, and this appears at 138 of the record, it said, “We have had to deny your request and we declare your position essential, so you'll probably be drafted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.945" offset="12957194">Well now Your Honors, if that is what made Mr. Cort decide to stay in England rather than his actual draft notice, which he received a few days later, we suggest that it's just as clear that he remained in England to evade the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.644" offset="13011947">We suggest that the fact that he knew he was -- that he heard that he was going to be drafted first from Harvard rather than from the Selective Service Authorities doesn't make any very important difference as far as his own mental attitude is concerned.</text>
