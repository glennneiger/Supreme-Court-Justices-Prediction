            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 256, United States, Petitioner, versus Talbot Patrick et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.574" offset="189628">Mr. Barnett, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="23.866" offset="198823">Mr. Chief Justice, this case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and did also involve the deductibility of legal fees incident, at least coincidentally to a divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.980" offset="247306">Now the reason I say coincidentally is we do not deny that husbands and wives may have business relationships between themselves or other relationships between themselves than marital rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.824" offset="310627">Our position about what is personal is that the defense of a claim based upon marriage rights arising out of marriage is personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.861" offset="366843">This case I don't think really involves that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.636" offset="377919">I think this case involves simply a rearrangement of independent property interest separately owned by the husband and wife and to that extent it's quite different from the Gilmore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.089" offset="431731">The marriage here was -- had lasted about for number of years</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="85.493" offset="445315">(Voice Overlap) closely approximate -- approximates the Reno divorce situation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="90.651" stopTime="514.307">
            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="90.651" offset="466004">No, no, no, the Reno divorce situation as I understood your question, the claim that was settled in the settlement was the wife's claim to alimony or to a property settlement and that is the Gilmore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.492" offset="521383">That's the Gilmore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.651" offset="525981">She is asserting marital rights that set the settlement of marital rights and obligations and those are personal rights and obligations in the expense of dealing with them are personal expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.532" offset="569448">This case, as I will show, involves the wife's separate ownership of some stock in the corporation and basically a purchase that stock by the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.133" offset="611871">There were three children of the marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.550" offset="621589">At the time of the divorce, one of them was of age and two were approaching their majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.347" offset="644786">The divorce seems to have been caused by so-called other woman who has anticipated the husband was -- was going to and he did in fact marry after the divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.680" offset="686059">The wife tame â€“ claimed the divorce on grounds of adultery.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.639" offset="701942">The husband didn't defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.435" offset="709151">His answer neither admitted nor denied charges that were approved by the wife by an admission made by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.954" offset="739140">Before the divorce was entered, they had settled their property affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.291" offset="760560">This case is about the fees incurred in settling the property affairs, not the fees of getting the divorce as such, the property of which they own at the time of the divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.008" offset="827434">Mr. Patrick was president and editor -- he was President of the Herald Publishing Company and the editor of the newspaper which it published.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.148" offset="867976">He also owned 28% of the stock of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.122" offset="887829">His wife owned independently another 28%.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.376" offset="904861">The adult son owned 9% in his own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.684" offset="918131">The rest of the stock was in trust for the minor children and some also for the adult child.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.616" offset="937880">The trustees of the trust were the husband and wife, so the voting control of the corporation turned upon the ownership of the husband, the wife and the adult son.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.380" offset="980929">Now, the wife's stock had been acquired by dissent from her father and as -- has have the stock owned by the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.236" offset="1020322">They didn't come from -- from Mr. Patrick at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.040" offset="1031502">It doesn't appear where Mr. Patrick got his stock but one supposes that he had gotten it from his father-in-law at some time or other.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.654" offset="1065984">In addition to their ownership of stock, the husband and wife jointly owned or owned in common the real estate that housed the newspaper building.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.567" offset="1105690">He had a fourth -- four fifths undivided interest and she had a one-fifth undivided interest and they leased the building to the newspaper company.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.346" offset="1144769">Now, these properties were the only properties -- I'm sorry, were the only properties other than two houses, they jointly owned two houses, these were the only properties involved in -- in the negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.853" offset="1222823">However, each of the parties in fact also had a substantial amount of other assets independently owned, consisting of various stocks and bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.881" offset="1266918">Mr. Patrick's salary as -- as editor was $15,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.673" offset="1286040">His dividends from the publishing company were worth $4,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.878" offset="1302862">His share of the gross rentals $15,000 and the building couldn't have come to more than $6,000 which would have produced a total income of about $25,000, but his total income reported was in fact $55,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.182" offset="1356152">He had $30,000 from other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.929" offset="1367124">It also appears that the wife was independently well to do although the size of their estate does not appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.737" offset="1402337">Now, the nature of the negotiation was an unscrambling of this interrelated interest of theirs in the newspaper business.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.565" offset="1445595">We have in the record depositions by the attorneys for each side who represented the parties in the negotiations and an explanation of what they were trying to do and why, what purposes they had sought to achieve and there is no conflict about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.732" offset="1514350">Mrs. Gilmore -- Mrs. Patrick was happy to have Mr. Patrick to continue as editor of the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.666" offset="1550085">He had greatly increased the circulation during the eight years that he had been the editor.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.191" offset="1576103">Mr. Patrick wanted to continue, but he was advised by his attorney that although there was not present disagreement between the parties, he thought it unwise for Mr. Patrick in view of the uncertain state of the future relationships to be subject to the risk of being out voted by the wife worth 28% and the eldest son who seem to be siding with the wife and so he advised Mr. Patrick that he ought to try to buy Mrs. Patrick's stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.827" offset="1718732">Mrs. Patrick recognized that she couldn't expect him to stay on certainly to that -- for that trap and she was quite willing to sell him the stock for its fair value.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.265" offset="1760423">Her one concern she say -- he said -- her attorney was to protect the interest of the children and the newspaper ultimately going to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.594" offset="1797726">Two of the children were already interested in journalism where one was already a newspaperman and the other was studying journalism in the family tradition and she wanted to be sure that the property would ultimately go to the children rather than to this new wife that he was going to acquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.095" offset="1867734">Mr. Patrick equally wanted to care for the children and he was quite happy, he planned to give the stock to the children anyway and he was quite happy to commit himself to give the stock and the real property to the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.710" offset="1930219">That's what the negotiations were about and the agreement that was finally arrived at was simply this that Mr. Patrick would convey Mrs. Patrick's blue chip securities of a value equal to the value of her shares of stock in the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.734" offset="2002317">She would transfer the stock to him subject to the condition that upon his death or if they should earlier decide to sell the whole business, he would pass to the children in equal shares, similarly the real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.989" offset="2071280">The -- the result was that the real property was put in to -- they first renegotiated the long-term lease with the newspaper corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.571" offset="2105657">And they put the real property in a trust to pay the income to the wife for life and the properties then to go in equal shares to the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.119" offset="2151842">Now, it's our view --</text>

            <text syncTime="545.027" offset="2283499">However, there's a bit putting the cart before the horse because the agreement was arrived at before he filed his answer in which he did not -- he did not deny adultery.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.586" offset="2325713">She proved adultery by his admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.848" offset="2338774">Now, I -- I don't mean to imply anything improper, but had the agreement fall in through, the divorce contest might have taken a very different action, it might have taken a very different course.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.715" offset="2386213">He might have contested and it maybe that she could not have proved that -- the adultery, but I dare say that there was in existence, a -- a potential right of the wife to demand a share of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.105" offset="2463744">The fact is that her attorney explained she didn't want anything for herself.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.228" offset="2780244">The sympathetic element is there, we say it's a purely personal claim, but actually, I -- I -- I don't think the reason that these expenses are nondeductible is primarily that they're personal -- but primarily that they're capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.095" offset="2831757">It's a purchase of stock by a minority stockholder who has falling out with the majority stockholder and obviously his position as an officer of the corporation has jeopardized any minority stockholder -- stockholding officer holds his office at the pleasure of majority stockholder and if the relationships become strained, it's to his advantage to buy up a majority interest and that really is what the transaction here was about and the cost of minority stockholder acquiring the majority interest in order to protect his position as president of the corporation is a capital cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.134" offset="3003956">It's like the cost of acquiring any stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.868" offset="3014823">Now, I would like to separate several of the other elements of the negotiations of the agreement to determine the characterization of the various elements that went into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.207" offset="3060172">The cost allocable to negotiating the provision for his payment of support for the two minor children, it's one of the provisions, is obviously personal we would say.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.002" offset="3107401">The cost of negotiating his purchase of her stock, we would say is capital to the extent that you allocate separately something to the negotiation about the remainder provision going to the children, the condition that go to the children, there might be a personal element in that since they're working out a mutual object to provide for a devolution to the natural objects of their bounty, but primarily, that element is capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.824" offset="3226624">The negotiation of the lease, the new lease between the owners of the property and the corporation, the expenses of negotiating a long-term lease are capital expenses, they must be capitalized and amortized over the period of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.731" offset="3286288">They're not currently deductible expenses that's -- as to the owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.227" offset="3308231">As to the corporation who by the way was in some way represented in -- in these negotiations in making this new lease, the expenses were not only capital, but they were expenses of the corporation and not of Mr. Patrick.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.083" offset="3367685">A stockholder's business and a corporation's business are very different things and if he paid any fees on behalf of the corporation executing the lease that was simply a contribution to capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.889" offset="3426931">The -- if any fees allocable to creating a trust for the real estate with life estate to the wife and remainder to the children, I would say are entirely personal to the extent that the wife's life estate was worth more than the 20% fee interest that she previously had.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.836" offset="3518673">There was a net transfer to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.627" offset="3525883">The values don't appear so I can't say that there wasn't much.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.441" offset="3537168">She owned 20% of the real estate to begin with and she gave up her 20% for a life estate in the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.549" offset="3569560">So there may have been a -- a net gain to her there so that's the only thing she got out of the agreement and -- and for all that -- that's all she ever asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.082" offset="3607698">But to the extent that she got something there and may have been recognition of the marital right which we would say is personal and to the extent that this is created in order to sure devolution to the children, we would say that's personal in -- in the sense of estate planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.148" offset="3683976">Basically, what this was that buy out by the husband of his wife's stock interest but the wife insisting upon some advance estate planning to protect the children to make sure that they got something.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.423" offset="3737057">I don't think an assertion of marital rights, the rights to alimony, the rights to a -- some of his property by virtue of marriage relationship were really involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.329" offset="3788675">Now, I say that not because I -- I --I'm concerned that they were, I think that's make it even more personal if they were, I think the main reason they're not deductible because they were capital.</text>

            <text syncTime="952.353" offset="3912808">There the wife admitted, there was a lumber business which admittedly was owned in community property and would be divided 50-50, there was no question of as in California of equitable division community property, it was her 50% of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.462" offset="3981249">And in that case, the husband wanted to keep the lumber business and ultimately arrived in agreement with the wife that he would get the lumber business, she would get the property out of the lake and the residence and a $100,000 in cash and some other property, apparently, it was all community property and all 50-50 ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.535" offset="4073514">Now that case involving community property I think is like Patrick.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.645" offset="4101935">That is a simply a transfer of capital interest admittedly independently owned by the two parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1020.260" offset="4184377">What is personal is an assertion of marital rights, the assertion that you're entitled to alimony because of the marriage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.209" offset="4288240">She asserted a claim to a part of the property arriving from her status as his wife during the period that it appreciated in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.090" offset="4323767">That, I -- I -- I would say, I would put with the rights in the common law state of the wife somewhat differently defined, but not ultimately really different in -- in substance particularly in California where they divide up the community property according to the equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.083" offset="4395656">I will put that with the rights in the community property estate to a proper a share of the -- a fair share of the husband's property or to alimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="2302.534" offset="9313468">Now, may it please the Court, I was handed a -- by counsel for the Government, a copy of the memorandum with respect to the Treasury Regulations on yesterday after that was used in the Gilmore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.500" offset="9397373">That had not been used in the courts below nor was it in brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.373" offset="9424854">The effect of it only is to say again that no attorney's fees in divorce actions are deductible as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.091" offset="9467695">Now, we can avoid considerable verbiage on that point because we agree -- we agree that attorney's fees in divorce actions as such are not deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.235" offset="9528299">We say that divorce -- that fees that are paid in a divorce action as such are personal in nature and are not deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.052" offset="9583574">We did not deduct divorce fees in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.884" offset="9606875">The divorce fees in this case were allocated for the divorce or separated from the -- the non-business expenses and no claim for their deduction was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.464" offset="9673226">We do say, however, that a divorce clearly may be the occasion for other fees which are deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.749" offset="9722337">Now, as we look at Section 212 subparagraph (2), it is -- a taxpayer is permitted to deduct non-business expenses and non-business is simply -- maybe a misnomer but that's the title the statute gives it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.204" offset="9816168">Now, how do we determine whether they are in this category or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.492" offset="9849292">At page 7 of the Patrick brief, we have taken a look at Lykes against the United States in which this Court cited in particular the House Committee reports and the Senate Committee reports at the time of the enactment of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.590" offset="9949706">For the purpose of dividing the congressional policy of legislative intent, the Court examined these reports thoroughly and then this Lykes case, we think spell out a good guide to the determination of whether or not these are non-business expenses and deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.712" offset="10042180">It said that the expenses in -- incurred in a sport or a hobby or a recreation clearly are not non-business expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.714" offset="10086275">It goes no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.747" offset="10090350">It says, however, that they must be ordinary and necessary, reasonable in amount and must bear a reasonable and proximate relation to the production of income or the management, conservation or maintenance of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.926" offset="10171120">In this case, the Government to this point has never questioned that these expenses were ordinary and necessary and reasonable in amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.696" offset="10210200">In fact, the Circuit Court, at page 62 of the Patrick record, comments on the fact that the Government has not raised that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.708" offset="10254190">The question is whether these fees were reasonably and proximately related to the management conservation or maintenance of income-producing property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.042" offset="10307584">We see that as being the only true test whether they're reasonably or proximately related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.597" offset="10337782">Now, in this case, the District Court, sitting without a jury, found as a matter of fact that these specific fees that were claimed as they were allocated and as they were set up, were in fact direct or reasonably and proximately related to the management conservation and maintenance of income-producing property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.572" offset="10453661">And we -- we cite you again the -- the trust of Bingham case which is already been mentioned here this morning, we have it on page 6 of our brief, in which this Court has said that the court below could find as a matter of fact on the question of reasonableness and proximity that that was a question for the trier of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.584" offset="10565674">And, in that particular, may I indicate to the Court that on page 6 near the bottom of the page where I have cited (Inaudible) against Bingham, the printers have dropped out a line which is very obvious.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.624" offset="10725857">Now, may it please the Court, after the District Court, sitting as a judge and the jury, had carefully examined these specific fees and had found as a matter of fact that they were reasonably and proximately related, the Circuit Court affirmed his decision and on 6 -- page 67 of the Patrick record, it had this to say, in view of the findings of fact of the District Court and the undisputed testimony in behalf of the petitioner, who was the taxpayer, we are to review the legal fees in the amount of $19,200 which were paid by the taxpayer for the protection and conservation of his income-producing property, were properly deductible as claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.959" offset="10947166">So that the finding of fact has been made by the trier of facts and affirmed here on the ba -- on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.451" offset="10977155">Now, may I inquire as to what facts the District Court considered?</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.646" offset="11013935">The -- the District Court heard the facts, the testimony from the witnesses, that Mr. Patrick, the taxpayer here, was editor and publisher of a newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.951" offset="11071195">They have -- there is in the record evidence that he had built-up that newspaper, that that was a part of his life work, that he was engaged in making it a more valuable and more worthwhile business property and that's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.190" offset="11172133">The publication of a small newspaper is a -- something rather personal and of great deal of meaning to an individual if I may say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.334" offset="11216750">Now, to what subject did these legal fees that we are claiming as deductible relate?</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.705" offset="11254157">How directly were they related to matters which might be called non-business expenses under it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.167" offset="11296057">There was $3200 in fees for the handlement -- the handling by the attorneys of the business real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.713" offset="11346213">Now that business real estate was not just real property somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.173" offset="11368051">That business real estate was the building occupied by the publishing company and in which the newspaper was published.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.201" offset="11412146">By the planning and the work of counsel in this case, the undivided interest of the wife and the husband in this building were placed in a trust, and most importantly, a long-term lease was negotiated which assured the use of that building by the publisher and if I -- I hope I'm not transgressing the record when I say that this is a small town in which the taxpayer liaison in which I laid up, and that building suitable for the publication of the newspaper of this sort are not found readily on every corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.542" offset="11625514">That was one of the elements to which these fees relate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.916" offset="11643068">Does that sound like a personal expense?</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.513" offset="11657383">The other was the 28% of the stock which was held at this time by the taxpayer's wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.644" offset="11705971">To this point, the taxpayer had act -- had exercised actual control of the publishing venture by sufferance of his wife and his children because he was simply a minority stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.270" offset="11776502">At this point, it was a matter of his business interest, not a personal matter, but a matter of his business interest, that he had legal control since the marital relationship was to be dissolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.540" offset="11845569">The record shows that there were prospects for sale of the business, this business which he had been building up and which he had been building into a -- a substantial business property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.364" offset="11908786">That was the manner in which the value of the stock was arrived at as a result of offers which had been made for the purchase of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.502" offset="11945357">It was to his business interest to retain control of the publication, the publishing company and the newspaper, by virtue of a legal control rather than the control by sufferance which would have gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.676" offset="12026128">Now, we have seen as I had to state at the outset, I thought, that actually he acquired only nominal ownership of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.985" offset="12079313">That as a result of this arrangement, which was not easy, because there are accountant, counsel employed by both of the parties and the record shows that one of the most difficult parts from a legal standpoint was to rearrange the stock ownership of this corporation, generally to provide for the -- the children of the parties but to do it in such a manner as was acceptable to both of the parties without disrupting completely the economic structure of the -- of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.897" offset="12246915">He could not sell that stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.012" offset="12255378">He cannot sell that stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.889" offset="12262902">He has simply the -- the use of it during his lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.303" offset="12292577">Now, the Government, as the record will show in the trial of this case and it's been mentioned here today, made a good deal of the fact that the income which the taxpayer derived from his position with the newspaper and the dividends which he derived form that stock, were in actuality less than half of his total income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.599" offset="12425801">But to make a point of that no certain facts of life that the record shows that the interest of the taxpayer, Mr. Patrick, was -- had been devoted to building up a property that that was the true value of the paper to him, to building up property not the immediate return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.494" offset="12521305">And furthering, we think this is most significant that aside from his salary from the Herald Publishing Company and his dividends, most of the rest of his income at that time came from stocks, bonds and so on from other investment property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.286" offset="12612524">A good part -- some of it at least, also came from the rental of this building.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.452" offset="12637184">Now, when this settlement was effected and he had divested himself of the building and he had traded these blue chip stocks, the income-producing value of the publishing company became more and more important to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.642" offset="12729971">Now, may it please the Court, at page 49 of the Patrick record, the District Court examined the clear allocation of fees made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.653" offset="12825997">The District Court on hearing the testimony and the evidence, found that $3200 in fees were charged for, allocated to and paid for services rendered by counsel in settling division of real estate and so on and that they were deductible as non-business expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.303" offset="12928606">The court then went on to say that the $16,000 was charged for, allocated to and paid for the services of counsel in negotiating the -- the rearrangement of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.272" offset="12992449">This is not a case where the court is asked to use any rule of thumb or any percentage or where any speculation as to such part of the fees as or non-business, the non-business expenses were clearly separated by counsel in billing here and were charged as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.429" offset="13109060">These fees were not expended, may it please the Court, to resist or to compromise liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.155" offset="13148035">They were expended for the purpose of cons -- of managing and we submit that managing is a broad word, of managing -- managing and conserving this specific income-producing property that we're speaking of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.765" offset="13222431">It was -- these expenses were a business-type expense, and we borrow that word from the Government's brief, they were business-type expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.914" offset="13287006">On these facts that you heard here, how could it have been found that they were personal in nature?</text>
