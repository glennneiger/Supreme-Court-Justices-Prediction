            <label>Mr. Northcutt Ely</label>
            <text syncTime="20.909" offset="187016">So I'm informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.677" offset="206033">Mr. Wilmer has submitted to the Court a set of tables indicating the quantity of water he believes California could survive on.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.203" offset="240201">This problem is litigated for several weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.034" offset="255457">Arizona decided to submit no findings or conclusions upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.709" offset="270190">We did, the Arizona decision apparently was made after Mr. Ryder, the Chief Planning Program Engineer of the Bureau of Reclamation may have gave the testimony which has been reproduced and submitted to you in which he classified the Imperial Irrigation District's efficiency as being near the top of those of all of the reclamation projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.683" offset="350124">We will cheerfully accept any probation under the decree that enforces conservation of water on both sides of the river and by the same standard where you think it as an appropriate provision of a decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.848" offset="394742">If it were so enforced, Arizona would have to cut back drastically upon the quantity she diverts per acre irrigated in Arizona because by the same testimony, her efficiency is far less than ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.669" offset="458062">Mr. Wilmer also said that it was a pigment of imagination to assume that any diversions were contemplated above Lake Mead and to the Central Arizona area.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.905" offset="511039">At page 125 of our opening brief, we have reproduced a quotation from the 13th Annual Report of the Arizona Interstate Stream Commission dated 1960, which says at page 31 of that report, “The circulation of the Special Master's draft report on Arizona versus California et al. has given new impetus to plans for utilizing Colorado River water in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.094" offset="615737">An integral part of Colorado River water utilization plants for Central Arizona is a route for diversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.056" offset="639561">The Stream Commission and the United States Geological Survey have undertaken a cooperative program to map the unsurveyed area which would be traversed by a proposed diversion route from Marble Canyon which on the map as you will see is above Lake Mead, where the mapping program nearing completion, detailed cost estimates can be made which will facilitate consideration of the relative desirability of this diversion route to Central Arizona.”</text>
            <text syncTime="161.440" offset="749171">This is not a pigment of imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.688" offset="758157">How the choice of routes will ultimately be resolved, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.401" offset="776965">Mr. Legott also indicated that -- oh pardon me -- Mr. Wilmer also indicated that Central Arizona was in arduous rates through the dropping of its water tables and indicated that we were pleading to this Court on a poor mouth basis as he called it and he would do likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.397" offset="848959">That is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.086" offset="855751">We do not ask here for sympathy or mercy for any of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.109" offset="875813">We do ask that the Project Act be interpreted as we think it was designed to be interpreted and shall not be rewritten in the light of an administrative contract made in 1944, our contract, our bargain was made in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.036" offset="935476">But as long as this subject is raised, I should like to refer to the fact that their draft report or the report of the Special Master contains tables prepared by an expert Arizona witness and Mr. Legott of the Valley National Bank, designed to show the explosive growth in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.654" offset="997961">Mr. Legott is the author of an article in the Arizona Highways in February - March 1962, an official publication of the State of Arizona in which this rather candid witness in this case, more recently, has expressed himself as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.005" offset="1075388">“The important Arizona's location in one of the most arid section of the United States often goes rise to questions as to whether its water supply is sufficient to permit a substantial population growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.662" offset="1121991">The question can be answered quite specifically and simply, and the answer is definitely, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.995" offset="1147382">The important point to bear in mind is the distinction between water for agricultural purposes and water for domestic purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.151" offset="1171937">In the latter of the respect, there is no water problem in the lowland areas of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.390" offset="1188968">Arizona's water resources are ample to support at least 10 to 15 times the present population, i.e. a population even larger than that of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.722" offset="1226271">In the process, this would probably mean that Phoenix larger than Los Angeles varies the thought” says, Mr. Legott, “and the Tucson larger than San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.460" offset="1261171">In all seriousness, Arizona's water supply for normal, domestic and industrial usage is one of the best in the country, although…” -- and he goes on with the quantities required.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.570" offset="1297638">Thus, Arizona's present population of approximately 1,400,000 consumes approximately 175,000 acre-feet of water per annum, which is about the same amount as waters would normally be utilized on 60,000 acres of irrigated cropland.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.852" offset="1350823">Stated in other way, the present domestic consumption of water in Arizona is less than 5% of the amount used for agricultural purposes and much of it actually finds its way back into the underground of reservoirs for reuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.962" offset="1395231">And he goes on to say at the conclusion of this paragraph, whenever a cow pasture or citrus grove is converted into a residential subdivision, there's both the saving in water and a tremendous property increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.246" offset="1436400">So we're confronted here with a -- whether the economy of Central Arizona based largely upon cotton shall continue by -- or whether it shall be gradually converted as we have had to do in Southern California by pulling up our beautiful orange groves and converting them to the support of the exploding population there.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>

          <turn speaker="northcutt_ely" startTime="357.595" stopTime="1208.611">
            <label>Mr. Northcutt Ely</label>
            <text syncTime="357.595" offset="1533785">I hope not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.919" offset="1539009">Too many of them have disappeared already.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.108" offset="1547786">But both states are faced with an exploding population, we realize that that is not the necessary basis of decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.826" offset="1582686">Now, as to the limitation issue upon which both Mr. Wilmer and Mr. Cox said well, the words in the Section 4 (a), the first paragraph, a proposal to California are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.458" offset="1637230">A reference is to 4,400,000 acre-feet of the waters apportioned to the Lower Basin States by paragraph of (a) of Article III of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.345" offset="1676727">We say that the Project Act intended by that to incorporate the compact whatever it might mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.624" offset="1705880">The Congress knew that tributaries were included in the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.272" offset="1728449">Sections 13, 13 (b), 13 (c), 13 (d) specifically provide that the United States and all those claiming under the United States shall conform to the compact and that this compact shall be impressed upon the main river and its tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.726" offset="1806294">The compact included the tributaries, Congress knew that, the Master so recognizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.442" offset="1833148">And it's important perhaps that in 1941 when Congress enacted the Boulder Canyon Project Adjustment Act, it specified that Section 18 of which you've heard here and these same Sections 13 (b), 13 (c) and 13 (d) should be reenacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.168" offset="1903992">The Master has made one of his -- the Master has made one of his few factual errors in his report in which he states that there is nothing to show that at the time of the Project Act or indeed since 1928, the Imperial Irrigation District had used the waters of the Gila River.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.751" offset="2006392">Elsewhere in his report, he states the facts correctly that from 1901 to 1941 appeared 40 years, the diversion point for the Imperial Canal was below the Gila River and the Gila was used by the Imperial.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.346" offset="2064802">But this fact was brought home to Congress in the testimony of Mr. Delph Carpenter, the principal author of the Colorado River Compact, and if you'll bear with me, I will quote a couple of paragraphs from his testimony on this specific subject as to why the Upper Basin as well California wherein it rested in the inclusion of the Gila in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.109" offset="2151842">Mr. Carpenter told a committee of Congress in 1926, the Gila River is not exclusively -- exclusively an Arizona stream even in the matter of origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.006" offset="2191444">Secondly, the Gila and every other River, mentioned, contributes if uninterrupted, its water supply to the main river above the largest diversion canal in America, the Imperial Valley Canal heading now below Yuma.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.964" offset="2243271">Gila water is of importance to the Imperial Valley Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.274" offset="2256436">The Canal naturally looks to the more stable flow from the main river but I'm informed that Gila water is frequently diverted and it has been my privilege to see water coming from the Gila River and flowing into the Colorado and down into the Imperial Valley Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.993" offset="2315368">That water is just as wet and just as serviceable as the water from the Green River in Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.899" offset="2335013">The waters of the Gila River are waters of the Colorado River just as much as the waters of the Green River.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.304" offset="2356537">So that when you look at these facts squarely, you were brought to the proposition that there is not a single tributary of the entire Colorado River that does not enter the River above Yuma and the greatest diverter from this river or from any river in America or the world as the Canal of Imperial Valley located below Yuma.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.779" offset="2426441">Then it goes on to say that they thought this advance that the Imperial District will move its point of diversion above Yuma and therefore with Gila no longer be of interest to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.769" offset="2462490">But he says a canal for the irrigation of lands in Mexico would head below the mouth of the Gila.The whole theory of the Laguna Dam connection is founded upon an all-American Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.082" offset="2499688">Then he concludes by saying, “I'm going into this matter because there seems to be an idea or a dream that the Gila is not a tributary.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.062" offset="2527587">An idea that because the All-American Canal will ultimately hook up with the Laguna Dam that therefore the Gila is a river unto itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.350" offset="2560815">Senator Phipps of Colorado having heard the debate in which Senator Pittman and Senator Hayden participated and reported to the Senate, the Upper Basin Governors' recommendations obviously were concerned about the confusion that the Master has pointed out in his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.688" offset="2642108">Now, we come to the Phipps Amendment in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.634" offset="2657886">But at page 189 and page 190, the Master points out that Senator Pittman in reporting to the Senate, the recommendation of the Governors in their 1927 Conference was confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.118" offset="2719848">The Governors were recommending a division of the water let down at Lee Ferry that is flow not consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.262" offset="2752449">Flow of the stream not consumptive use as the Master would allocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.716" offset="2778258">This -- says the Master, this report by Senator Pittman did not adopt or perhaps failed to grasp that portion of the Governors' resolution which expressly found the source of the allocated waters in the Article III (d) obligation of the upper division.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.774" offset="2834474">Instead, Senator Pittman related the limitation to Article 3 (a) not 3 (d) as appears from the very next sentence of his statement which reads as follows and he quotes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.471" offset="2873240">On page 190, the Master continues, “Thus Senator Pittman use Article III (a) to define the area against which the limitation was to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.985" offset="2907303">He did this in apparent misunderstanding of the Governor's recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.020" offset="2923499">All subsequent discussion in the Senate flowed in the same channel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="709.049" offset="2939591">Now, shall we be held to the bargain which the California legislature enacted in response to plain language of an act of Congress or shall be held of the confusion entertained by one senator, and so described by the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.963" offset="2991208">Senator Phipps of Colorado was the Chairman of the reporting committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.300" offset="3008554">He was the author of the limitation and he was obviously concerned by this growing confusion because Senator Phipps offered a perfecting amendment to his own limitation which at the time read 4,600,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.464" offset="3069262">The circumstances are cited in our opening brief at page 118.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.983" offset="3095280">Senator Phipps said, “Referring to the amendment which is now before the Senate that was the committee amendment which imposed the limitation of 4,600,000 acre-feet.”</text>
            <text syncTime="758.212" offset="3136240">Referring to the amendment which is now before -- and pardon me, 4,400,000 -- it had already been voted upon 4,600,000 versus 4,200,000 had been settled upon as 4,400,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.412" offset="3181066">Referring to the amendment which is now before the Senate, in order to remove any possible misunderstanding regarding the 4,400,000 acre-feet of water, I desire to perfect the amendment by inserting on page 3, line 4 after the word “by”, the words paragraph (a) of Article III of, so that it will show that that allocation of water refers directly to the seven and one half million acre-feet of water that are mentioned in paragraph 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.056" offset="3307604">Senator Phipps' perfecting amendment was accepted without objection and thereafter, the Phipps Amendment, the 4,400,000 acre-feet in it, instead 4,600,000 was adapted by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.090" offset="3351698">There cannot be a more explicit clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.296" offset="3368521">This did not come early in the debate as the Solicitor General is mistaken in believing.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.026" offset="3387434">This was virtually the last utterance before the Limitation Amendment was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.339" offset="3408750">It was approved by the Senate upon that understanding which identified the 7,500,000 million acre-feet with III (a) which includes the tributaries and cleared up the misunderstanding, the confusion, as the Master calls it, Senator Pittman and Senator Hayden that the limitation related to the flow of the stream at Lee Ferry, the III (d) obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.981" offset="3487326">Now, it is clear, however, that Senator Hayden was not demanding from the Senate, 2,800,000 acre-feet of consumptive use, diversions, less returns to the stream at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.601" offset="3541765">Senator Hayden was consistent in relating the divisional water that he proposed to the flow of the stream, the III (d) delivery of Lee Ferry.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.916" offset="3627029">Senator Hayden, three times, told the Senate that if Arizona were permitted to divert 2,800,000 acre-feet for the proposed Parker-Gila project, some 944,000 acre-feet of that when returned to the stream be capable of use only by Mexico and that Arizona claim no credit for that return flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.012" offset="3731414">Here is his specific language.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.512" offset="3737370">He is referring to the second paragraph of Section 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="913.543" offset="3757537">He has first described that the 2,800,000 -- 2,844,000 be diverted for this specific project, the Parker-Gila Project that the experts have testified the 948,000 acre-feet of the return flow and he nails it down with this statement: “I have specified in the amendment which I have offered that the State of Arizona lays no claim to that return flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.843" offset="3858787">We do not ask to have any credit for it after it arises in the mainstream of the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.611" offset="3881775">It will be surplus and unappropriated waters which Arizona cannot use and that water and that alone will be sufficient to supply any demand for water to meet the existing uses in Mexico.”</text>
            <text syncTime="956.363" offset="3928795">The Master in other words awards to Arizona by definition of the 2,800,000 acre-feet as diversions less returns consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.807" offset="3966621">Some 948,000 acre-feet more than Senator Hayden explained to the Senate, he expected to get.Senator Hayden was consistent in his confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.490" offset="4009357">He identified at all times the allocation, the division he thought would be accomplished by Section 4 (a) to the flow of the river, the flow at Lee Ferry and not the consumptive use diversions less returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.582" offset="4057736">Only by this explanation of Senator Hayden, can you possibly reconcile the arithmetic of Section 4 (a) with the arithmetic of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.726" offset="4094307">Senator Pittman obviously was not content to leave this kind of confusion in the record, the man responsible for the act, he straightened it out with his perfecting amendment in California accepted the limitation in the light of the Phipps perfecting amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.132" offset="4151881">Nowhere did anybody propose a vote upon an amendment which would substitute for 4,600,000 or 4,200,000 or 4,400,000, an authorization of the Secretary of the Interior to reduce that figure to 44 seventy-fifths of X what the Secretary might elect to release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.462" offset="4229204">To the contrary, Senator Johnson was explicit in stating to the Senate that the -- that we were dealing with an irreducible minimum in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.817" offset="4290644">At 70 Congressional Record 385, Senator Johnson said this, “I say to the gentleman of Arizona, you say the California shall have a 4,200,000 acre-feet, we say in the testimony of Mr. Francis Wilson is the best upon that subject” -- pardon me, “that the irreducible minimum of the State of California is 4,600,00 acre-feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.834" offset="4534732">The United States in its brief does not characterize the Arizona project as a Section 5 water delivery contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.979" offset="4575274">To the contrary, the United States says in its answering brief at page 47, “It is our understanding that this contract with Arizona does not by itself authorize the actual delivery of water in compliance with Section 5 of the Project Act, since that Section requires that the contracts be entered into with the actual users of the water, rather, this contract is in the nature of a commitment by the Secretary to enter into the contracts with users in Arizona up to the limit of 2,800,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.054" offset="4687600">In this sense, it is an allocation by the Secretary of that amount of water for a future contractual use.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.322" offset="4708707">We say that neither Section 5 nor any other section authorizes the Secretary of Interior to make any such interstate apportionment, any such allocation for future use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.944" offset="4747160">And indeed Arizona, in her brief, opposing the theory of the United States that the Secretary or the creation of an Indian reservation, somehow reserves water, it calls the attention to Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.515" offset="4801390">And Arizona's opening brief at page 144 says this, “Section 8 of the Reclamation Act also proscribes that beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure and the limit of the right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.574" offset="4845693">“This requirement,” says Arizona “cannot be reconciled with the concept that a water right maybe acquired by a reservation without any physical application of water to have beneficial use.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.092" offset="4891773">If that is true with respect to the Federal Indian Law, it is surely true with respect to the Federal Reclamation Law in which Section 8 appears and which is incorporated in the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
