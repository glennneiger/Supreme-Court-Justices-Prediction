            <text syncTime="32.134" offset="231946">This is a review which involves additional questions of administrative agency acts, notably the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.199" offset="280116">It involves questions that arise under the Administrative Procedure Act, some of which, I think, have never previously been determined by the Court, and also, questions under the Federal Trade Commission Act which that the District Court below indicated were noble questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.724" offset="382307">The petition for certiorari raised or requested review on six separate questions in the Court's order, however, granting review, which is in the record at page 237.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.924" offset="463078">Certiorari was allowed on March 27, 1961, limited to four questions designated by the same numbers that we had used in our petition, namely, numbers 2, 3, 5 and 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.687" offset="558164">Now, I have to point out, Your Honor, that in the brief for the United States, served only a few days ago, under which we have replied by a brief filed today, there has been injected improperly, we believe, an additional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.890" offset="662967">You will recall that the question on which you will allow review, numbered 5 on page 237 reads as follows, "Our petitioners retained and filed copies of -- of confidential reports to the Bureau of Census for the Census of Manufacture subject to the investigative process of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.629" offset="785847">Now, on that very question, which was presented to this Court in Federal Trade Commission against Dilger, decision from the Seventh Circuit, this Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.823" offset="846660">And at that time, on the petition for certiorari, the then Solicitor General did not sign the petition but he added at the foot of the petition, his statement of the difference of views in the Government Departments that the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice felt there should be no confidential of treatment accorded these retained copies of census reports, whereas the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Bureau of the Budget are quite the contrary that it would destroy the whole policy and the purpose of reporting census --</text>

            <label>Mr. Horace R. Lamb</label>
            <text syncTime="232.739" offset="1034324">Before the lunch and adjournment, I had referred to the questions on which certiorari was allowed and referred to the confidential treatment of the census, and I was mentioning the new issue, new question which, for the first time, had been raised here in the reply brief of the Solicitor General, namely, that we had waived our right to the confidential treatment of -- of the census reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.348" offset="1172773">Now, on the main question, I read from the brief of the Solicitor General that he is in accord with our position, and I understand his position to be the same as his predecessor in regard to the petition for certiorari in the Dilger case to which I had referred briefly before the adjournment.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.304" offset="1288547">But on this waiver question, which a large part of the Government's brief attempts to discuss, I think, I must, at the outset, state that our position is that that's an improper additional question to raise here.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.748" offset="1390320">First, we say that it's in violation of Rule 40, subparagraph (1), small (d) (2) of the rules of this Court, which we have quoted in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.452" offset="1453223">And that -- under that rule, we believe this Court will disregard and will not consider this additional question of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.399" offset="1500975">And we further point out that under all of the appellate decisions, it is universally held that it's unfair to an adversary to raise in the court of last resort for the first time, a issue never previously raised in any of these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.633" offset="1605883">And I think the decisions support our position on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.715" offset="1634200">But even in fact, we say that the Solicitor General has overlooked the fact that during the entire course of this investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, it has consistently been our position that census reports should be accorded confidential treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.666" offset="1733987">It's his position that because in the informal proceedings before a representative of the staff of the Commission, we did allow inspection of certain census reports of some companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.032" offset="1795532">And because in the further proceedings to which I'll refer on a subpoena duces tecum issued by the -- the Commission, we did produce certain copies of the reports, filed reports and in fact, we had obtained photocopies because we couldn't locate some of the filed copies of the reports of the Census of Manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.653" offset="1905977">And we refer to the positions expressly stated on this point, long before answer, the disposition of the Solicitor General but only in our answer did we raise it for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.462" offset="1973269">But as I point out in the reply brief, we raised it not only in the answer but prior to that, in a letter written as long ago as August 18th, 1959 to the Commission's Secretary, which is quoted in part at page 6 of the reply brief of the petitioner where I made the point that among a number of items in which information was requested by the Commission, they were of a confidential nature and in our view, cannot properly -- the Commission cannot properly require that such information be furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.726" offset="2142229">And I said this, “We refer particularly to request for copies of reports for the Census of Manufacture which have been held confidential," citing cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.409" offset="2193011">Was that before that letter, Mr. Lamb?</text>
            <text syncTime="524.447" offset="2201161">Was that before you furnished any of these reports that are now relied on as your waiver?</text>

            <label>Mr. Horace R. Lamb</label>
            <text syncTime="529.486" offset="2221328">That was not before we had given an opportunity to inspect certain reports, and I think it was after certain reports had been furnished under the subpoena duces tecum which is -- as I recall, it was in the year 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.192" offset="2292172">I will review in a moment, Your Honor, the chronology of these investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.312" offset="2312652">But I merely want to deal with this question, if I may, at the outset but then, I'm not going to argue it much further, unless the Court feels that we should because we think both in law and in fact, the Solicitor is in error confessing that point and that it should not be considered now at this late date.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.279" offset="2416515">I think it's the general rule that where there is an effective waiver, it's usually, of course, in an adversary proceeding and there must be one in intent on the part of the person waiving the privilege that he intends to waive it or there must be an advantage to be gained by the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.404" offset="2505017">Now, neither of those tests, you say, applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.367" offset="2532812">I think it would -- I -- I should say one further thing and I think I, in part, said it before luncheon, but on question number 5, I don't think that we need to argue that at great length because question number 5, I understand the Commission agrees with our position and he has stated at page 10 of his brief, the Solicitor General is of view that if the Court reaches the question, which, of course, the -- I assume the Court will reach because it -- it's one of the questions that said, “It would review number 5.”</text>
            <text syncTime="648.343" offset="2696756">The statutory privilege should -- should extend to the retained copies of reports to the Census of Manufacture but not to the underlying data in the company's books and records upon which the reports are based.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.961" offset="2791215">The paragraph starting, “Instead of burdening the Court with briefs,” the attempt to give set forth the competing arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.543" offset="2817546">He goes to the length of -- of setting forth a competing arguments but makes it quite clear, and I hope I'm accurate about this, that this Solicitor General has his predecessor agrees that they should be accorded confidential treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.567" offset="2885674">Now, I think it would be interesting to review briefly how these questions come before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.650" offset="2933948">This proceeding has had a rather long history.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.032" offset="2959548">My client, as early as 1951, exchanged it shares of its stock for shares, all of the outstanding shares, I may say, of a number of small converting companies in the manufacture of converted products such as boxes, various kinds of containers and other materials.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.303" offset="3088593">My client is a -- what's called an integrated paper manufacturer, that is from the timber, fibres right straight through to various grades of paper and is a large producer of craft paper and has probably one of the largest craft paper mills, I believe, in the world at Jacksonville, Florida, erected in the early 1950s.</text>

            <text syncTime="776.714" offset="3210219">As a matter of fact, if I may amplify on that a moment, the announcement that the St. Regis Paper Company intended to go into the manufacture of linerboard in a large way at this large plant announced in the early 1950s.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.822" offset="3278660">Following the scarcity of that commodity, the end of the Korean War, was, we believe, the direct stimulus for the inquiries that came initiated by, I may say, these small mostly family hold -- held corporations to join St. Regis by an exchange of shares and thereby secure their converting operations as permanent supply of linerboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.133" offset="3443858">Well, that mill came into production in -- it was announced in the late -- in early 1950s.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.184" offset="3472071">It's about 1955, it got into production.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.025" offset="3483460">These acquisitions, which the Commission inquires about, started with a letter from the Commission that was issued under date of September 1956 from the first inquiry from the Commission appears in the record at page 88.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.912" offset="3583039">I may say, Your Honor, I'm going to review here a number of the exhibits in the District Court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.358" offset="3624835">I could say that -- perhaps, I should say here that the history of the proceedings starting with this letter go through long periods of submission of great many documents, voluntarily in accordance with the Commission's established policy and proceeds a year later by the issuance on December 13th, 1957 or prior -- prior to that date as a matter of fact, in September of 1957 of a subpoena duces tecum which appears in the record specifications attached to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.162" offset="3823992">It starts on page 109 and it's dated September 16, 1957, addressed to the secretary of the petitioner and to which there are annexed specifications of the various documents that are to be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.120" offset="3899852">To return to the letter of September 7th of record 88 and 89, I direct the Court's attention that on page 89, the request that was made to our client read as follows, “It is therefore requested that you furnish this office with full and complete answers to each of the questions set out below and with copies of specified documentary material.”</text>
            <text syncTime="979.514" offset="4021478">And then, there follows a good many questions to be answered and documents to be produced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.906" offset="4190960">And on page 100, they identify a great deal of the various kinds of products by reference to, in the right hand column, census product code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.212" offset="4240175">And in below that column, you will find a whole series of -- rather a long numbers which are the code numbers assigned by the Department of Commerce to these various commodities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.670" offset="4590007">At page 64, subparagraph (d) in one of the affirmative defenses of our answer, there is this statement quoted by Mr. Sideman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.083" offset="4651656">And it was following that end of the proceeding in December 1957 that in the following year of June, the further letter of June 30, 1958, which is mentioned just below the -- what I've quoted, was received from Mr. Stroud, an attorney in the Federal Trade Commission's Office in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.835" offset="4758758">Now, it would take quite a long time to go through this entire record, and I'll endeavor to summarize it, but I think that it can be demonstrated that my client has furnished and did furnish in response to this request a very large volume of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.316" offset="4852590">As a matter of fact, before the Hearing Examiner Sideman, I think there were 213 separately numbered exhibits, and some of those exhibits included quite a number of documents on a particular subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.882" offset="4950915">What following the letter on which raised questions that we tried our level best, I think it's fair to say to resolve by pointing out that in response to the original letter of 1956 and in the subpoena duces tecum proceedings, the Commission already had received and had in its file the answers to a great many of the questions that it continued to ask of, that they answer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.347" offset="5096782">I think that we have any serious difficulty with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.640" offset="5113919">It dealt larger with a request that the Commission made in its letter asking that we give the names of the 10 largest customers in various product lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.564" offset="5169612">And that raised very great difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.614" offset="5181837">It was our position that under the rules of the Commission, names of customers are confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.854" offset="5206810">It's also an exceedingly difficult matter to arrive for any particular time and the determination of who is your customer that maybe included in such a group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.141" offset="5255920">And we proposed two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.582" offset="5269713">First, let us not give you the actual names, let us give you designation by symbols, and we will give you the figures from our books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.499" offset="5317360">If you wish to verify from our books, you may come and do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.899" offset="5335019">But we were reluctant to give them to the Commission unless we could have assurance from the Commission that they would not make further verification and the belief that a verification among customers would be prejudicial and we're really in the nature of trade secrets and trade information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.071" offset="5419656">We come finally to the fact that apart from the letters and the subpoena proceedings, the Commission itself began to take a formal action, which it did in its resolution that was adopted in -- it's next to the answer of January 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.604" offset="5617768">That resolution, Your Honors, appears at page 7 of the transcript as Exhibit A to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.225" offset="5676283">And that's the resolution directing an investigation of the acquisition by St. Regis of the stock or assets or both the stock and assets of other corporations, reciting it has reasonable grounds to believe that those acquisitions may be in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.969" offset="5763218">And it's in the public interest to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.932" offset="5779101">And they asserted, we believe, for the first time that it's ever been attempted by the Commission that it have authority under Section 6 (a) and (b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act to investigate, to determine whether one of the antitrust laws has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.135" offset="5867917">Now, I appreciate that on that question, the District Court held against us and certiorari was not granted, so we accept here, as we must, that it settled and there's no use arguing on the power of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.976" offset="5939284">We did undertake to respond to the nine different letters which are exhibits beginning B on page 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.579" offset="5993723">And I point out that Exhibit B is addressed to the petitioner and that Exhibit, I believe it's J are the two letters that are addressed to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.824" offset="6078673">All of the other letters are addressed to others than the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.541" offset="6097586">Exhibit J appears at page 44.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.170" offset="6116080">You'll note they are entitled orders requiring filing of special report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.696" offset="6138128">But as you read the text, they are actually, in our view, requests in large part for answers and writing the specific questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.639" offset="6197896">But they are very much like subpoenas, and I think there were so treated by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.522" offset="6237497">Now, a great deal of the information requested was furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.694" offset="6262157">There are some of it that was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.309" offset="6280652">Without going into the details, we show in a summary form in the graphs, which the Government itself prepared, annex to our brief at -- as Appendix B, a number of figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.020" offset="6363408">And I direct your attention particularly to Appendix B, Figure 3 which refers to orders numbered 1 and 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.163" offset="6411995">This is the annex to the petitioner's brief, where the circular graph shows the results in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.868" offset="6470823">I come to the opinion of the District Court just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.263" offset="6484407">But in short, the District Court found that according to their own estimate, 14% of the total number of questions were unenforceable on the ground that they were vague, indefinite and incapable of being answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.630" offset="6553893">And as to 49%, while holding them that they were enforceable but there was no necessity for enforcing because we had furnished, in response to the Court's own request in answer to the Government's comments of defaults, the place is square, we had previously furnished a great deal of the requested information, and that applies to that 49%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.078" offset="6679698">So that part of the pie which totals 63% of these requests were not enforced by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.949" offset="6735182">And as to the other 37%, 3% of them related to the reports to the Census of Manufactures, leaving only 34% or approximately one-third as to which the District Court's order required enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.294" offset="6832567">Now, the District Court's order, and I say first, I think I pointed out that this case was tried on stipulated facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.216" offset="6872273">And the stipulation appears in this record at page 69, stipulation of facts and pre-trial order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.596" offset="6929742">And there is the resumé and the chronological development to which I previously referred regarding the receipt of the September 19, 1956 letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.484" offset="6993272">I might call that I made on September 7th on the Bureau of Investigation of the Commission in order to see if we could not present on an informal basis, all of the data that they wanted and at which time, I did exhibit documents, the most important of which were copies of registrations statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.688" offset="7090134">All of these of exchanges and shares, of course, were subject to the requirement of a formal registration statement and prospectus which contained a whole mind of information regarding the lines of commerce on which our client and the propose to collect corporation were engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.514" offset="7169442">There is reference also on page 72, paragraph (10) to the inspection of certain reports of the Census of Manufactures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.380" offset="7240913">Now, you can see that it goes on into hundreds and hundreds of documents that are requested.And --</text>

            <text syncTime="2165.409" offset="8765001">Note that the complaint is in two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.627" offset="8781928">Count 1 is an action by the Government for relief in the nature of mandamus to compel the petitioner here to make answer to the various -- the two commission orders, so-called, by letters dated January 6, 1959 made -- and -- and the six orders also issued on January 9th, 1959 to petitioners and certain other companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.193" offset="8976175">And it anne1xes to the complaint, not only the resolution to which I've earlier referred but the various so-called orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.755" offset="9010343">And the relief asked for as to count 1, appears on page 6 wherefore plaintiff demands one that the Court issue a mandatory injunction demanding defendant, its agent, attorneys and assigns to file with the Federal Trade Commission all the special reports required by the Commission's several orders dated January 9, 1959 and June 8, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.253" offset="9116400">And on the second count, demanding forfeitures in the amount of $100 a day for two alleged defaults, our answer, it begins on page 7 -- I beg your pardon, those are the annexes to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.924" offset="9203022">Our answer is to be found on page 58 where we answered the affirmance of count 1 and of count 2 and set up on page 61 our affirmative defenses, several in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.100" offset="9319737">After the case was tried on stipulated facts, to which I've referred, and the opinion of the District Court is printed in the record at page 204.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.169" offset="9432064">The case was assigned by the Chief Judge to himself, Justice -- Chief Judge Sylvester Ryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.283" offset="9464456">And he tried the case over several days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.912" offset="9487026">He examines in detail all of the various documents and records, which I've rather heard or referred to, refers to the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.867" offset="9542823">And you'll note at the top of page 206, the Court says, “This is the first time a Section 6 (b) order had ever been used by the Commission prior to the filing of a complaint.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.717" offset="9606248">I think that's the true statement but never previously, in an effort to investigate whether Section 7, the Clayton Act, had been violated as the Commission ever resorted to powers under Section 6 (b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.251" offset="9680332">It's not directly a material to our point, Your Honor, only that I do make the point that having asked for a mandatory injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.921" offset="9735084">I'm pointing out that the Court reached the conclusion that based on the dicta of this Court in the Morton Salt case, he believed there was power and that the orders were validly issued, as he says at the bottom of page 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.392" offset="9800913">But then, it turns to the subject matter of the orders and he states that if the Commissioner were -- on page 29, if the Commissioner is going to make use of this Section 6 (b), it must realize at the outset that the outmost care in comparing these orders is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.341" offset="9888684">The character of the process itself requires certain limits to be placed upon the kind of the orders to protect those to whom they are directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.245" offset="9920345">And it goes on and discusses statistical information that's requested, and then stated its conclusions that when Section 6 (b) is read in conjunction with Section 9 of the Federal Trade Commission Act which is the provision of the Act giving the Commission right to issue subpoenas, it was designed as a means of convenience to businessmen on the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.964" offset="10059212">And he found that we were justified because he reviews the orders that he found that we should answer and those that should not answer and made his own order pursuant to Section 6 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.230" offset="10152312">Now, we say that having made a new order, and the judgment is at page 213, under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Court's order completely superseded the Commission's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.437" offset="10221171">There had been no default as -- no default whatsoever in compliance with the Court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.714" offset="10250219">You will note that the Court's order by arrangement between counsel was divided into different parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.615" offset="10281880">You read those paragraphs, there are certain sorts of documents that would be supplied in 30 days and certain parts in 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.161" offset="10316048">We promptly complied with all of the requirements of the 30-day clause in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.620" offset="10341857">And to our surprise, on the 60th day, the Government served notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.863" offset="10366830">We immediately cross-appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.442" offset="10377174">The Government appealed, may I point out, Your Honor, the only problem, the dismissal of count 2 which was the denial of the forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.365" offset="10416880">The Government did not appeal from any of the determinations holding the Commission's orders substantially defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.973" offset="10455228">We did appeal in our cross-appeal to raise the question of the power of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.362" offset="10476857">And in the Court of Appeals, the opinion appears at 219.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.254" offset="10508413">The Court holds and agrees with the Court that it had the power to issue the orders but to our great surprise, it made a very unusual holding, and it held that -- on page 232, that the investigative orders, obliged by the Act, may not satisfy the statutory definition of an order, since it may not be a final disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.966" offset="10667238">However, the order amounts to a sanction because of the forfeiture.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.707" offset="10730245">This, to my mind, is the basic error of the -- of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.950" offset="10751143">It's this, and I quote, “Although modification of an agency's order under 6 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act is the most efficient treatment of partially void order -- of a partially void order, it carries with it the imposition of penalties for prior noncompliance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.488" offset="10841318">Now, we say, Your Honors, that that's contrary to the provisions of Section 6 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act which carries its own penalty for contumacious failure to comply with the Court's order and it's contrary to the clear intention of the Congress in the legislative history of Section 6 (c), which we have quoted at page 16 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.613" offset="11001814">And I would briefly point out the extracts that we quote from the House Report.</text>

            <text syncTime="2838.188" offset="11456136">This is a very important case involving the administration of the antitrust laws and specifically, the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.477" offset="11501275">The petitioner, the St. Regis Paper Company, is the second largest manufacture in the country of paper and paper products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.029" offset="11535444">During the 1950s, St. Regis began acquiring a number of related companies, some apparently competitors and some vertical integrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.502" offset="11589360">The Federal Trade Commission was concerned as to whether this violated Section 7, the due amendment Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.840" offset="11626768">And accordingly, it sought to acquire information about the petitioner and about its place in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.893" offset="11658951">After a long period of trying to get the information voluntarily, the Commission resorted to Section 6 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which appears on page 72 of our brief."</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.792" offset="11726555">Section 6 provides that the Commission shall have power," then I skipped down towards the very bottom of the page, "to require by general or special orders, corporations engaged in commerce," skipping a little, "to file with the Commission in such form as the Commission may prescribe annual or special or both annual and special reports or answers in writing the specific questions furnishing the -- to the Commission such information as it may require as the organization, business, conduct, practices and management in relation to other corporations".</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.814" offset="11870647">And then the final sentence says that the report shall be filed within such time as the Commission may prescribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.393" offset="11908995">The Commission's orders directed to St. Regis came after a long period of trying to get this information otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.458" offset="11941177">And I may say that the District Judge pointed out that this was the first time the question had arisen in the Court because this was the first time in more than 400 cases that the Commission had not been able to get this information voluntarily and that those questions all related to perspective Section 7 investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.510" offset="12033442">The orders to file the reports were served on St. Regis and its subsidiaries, some on June 8th, 1959 and some earlier in January 8th, 1959.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.075" offset="12163636">I shall deal with that along with the other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.875" offset="12174921">It might be helpful to summarize the essential facts firstly and in relation to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.406" offset="12201044">There was a motion to quash or to modify the order for the filing of the special reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.353" offset="12224763">That led to some delay but no report was filed, no information to speak of was filed after the order for the special report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.227" offset="12264260">And therefore, in -- in June 18 and in July 22nd, 1959, the Commission served the petitioner with the notice of default.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.670" offset="12310026">This is provided for, as I'll show in a moment, in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.864" offset="12326849">The 30-day period following the notice of default went by and the Commission then commenced this action which is brought under Sections 9 and 10 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.686" offset="12386095">The relevant paragraph of Section 9 has to do with the enforcement of the order for the special report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.802" offset="12414621">And you'll see that on page 73 in our brief, Section 9 of the Federal Trade Commission Act next to the last paragraph, provides that on application of the Attorney General of the United States, the District Courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus commanding any person or corporation to comply with the provisions, these referred to sections of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.314" offset="12508662">The original says the provisions of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.297" offset="12528515">Under Section 10, relevant portion of which appears over on page 75, the Commission included a count seeking penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.205" offset="12576162">At the bottom of the page, Section 10 provides, “If any corporation required by this Act to file any annual or special report shall fail to do so within the time fixed by the Commission and after notice of default," and so forth, "if then fails to comply, the corporation shall forfeit to the United States, the sum of $100 for each and everyday of the continuance of such failure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.184" offset="12680129">Now, as the case comes here, it falls into two parts which correspond to the sections of Section 9 and Section 10 that I've just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.714" offset="12726209">One part relates to the question whether the Commission shall be ordered to comply -- excuse me, the corporation shall be ordered to comply with certain portions of the special report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.602" offset="12781798">And this relates, as the issue has now been known, solely to the question of certain retained copies of the census reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.819" offset="12818683">The other part of the case relates to our right to recover the penalties for failure to comply with the order for the special report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.765" offset="12854418">Now, I would like to deal first with the question of the penalties and then to come second with the legal questions surrounding the retained copies of the census reports.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.156" offset="13336012">To be a little more precise about his argument with respect to the question, it's helpful, I think, to refer back to the exact language of Section 6 and then of Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.089" offset="13391705">Section 6 speaks of an order to file with the Commission in such form as the Commission may prescribe annual or special or both annual and special reports or answers in writing the specific questions furnishing such information as the Commission may require about certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.187" offset="13468087">As I understand Mr. Lamb's argument, it is that the words "special reports and answers in writing to specific questions" are mutually exclusive, that answers in writing to specific question cannot be comprehended within the term "special reports".</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.959" offset="13547186">And then he says, if you turn over to Section 10 dealing with penalties, that it prescribes a penalty only for a failure to file an annual or special report.</text>

            <text syncTime="3437.416" offset="13853027">Many of the reports, I would guess, most of the reports we file in life do answer various kinds of specific questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="5037.988" offset="20255326">These -- there are difficult questions here to, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.824" offset="20274657">Petitioner's second argument is that Section 6 and 10 taken together, the penalty section, are unconstitutional because a -- an accruing penalty of $100 a day is imposed without any explicit provision for prior judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.821" offset="20374653">Our answer to that is that we think that if the penalties are heavy, so burdensome, that it would be unfair to require the petitioner to wait and take his chance in the action to recover the penalties if they are that burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.917" offset="20442990">Then he has the right under Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act to seek review of the Commission's order without waiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.122" offset="20487816">On the other hand, if the penalties are not burdensome enough to justify equitable intervention, then we think a fortiori, they're not unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="5140.432" offset="20665135">Well, I would say again two things about the Claire Furnace case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.503" offset="20689377">First, Claire Furnace case precedes the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act and that therefore assuming it to have been proper then, the Administrative Procedure Act has changed the law in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.989" offset="20743293">Second, I would point out that the Claire Furnace case, in addition to being one which had given the Court very obvious trouble in view of having been argued twice, a long time it was on the docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.554" offset="20793553">That's -- a suit there was brought against the Federal Trade Commission whereas the action for penalties could be brought only by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.287" offset="20832528">And the case therefore it seems to me only to hold that the action could not be brought against Federal Trade Commission, not that no action for relief in equity would lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.316" offset="20888639">And I'm confirmed in Justice Stewart, by the fact that Chief Justice Hughes in a case not cited in our brief, California against Latimer, California v. Latimer - 305 U.S. 255, I don't know whether to say -- explain or strongly hinted that the Claire Furnace case should be put on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.357" offset="20976828">In any event, he clearly indicated that that was the ground on which he thought it would be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.577" offset="20997726">Now, with the problem here about which party you name would have been cured by the Administrative Procedure Act and we think that the action could have been brought under that Section.</text>

            <text syncTime="5251.646" offset="21109948">I -- I ought to point out however that when the Federal Trade Commission said that, it was only 10 days before this action for the penalties had been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="5261.712" offset="21150177">It was after there had not only been a failure to comply with the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.373" offset="21164910">It was after the notice of default and was right on the very suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.143" offset="21183927">Furthermore, when the action for the penalties had been filed at that time it would seem to me that it would have been appropriate for the petitioner, he was entitled to that relief, to go in an ask for a stay of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.416" offset="21233037">The case was already in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.251" offset="21240351">And this of course is a request that they finally made when it got to this Court and which this Court granted in its answer -- in its order on the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.691" offset="21294164">The other argument that petitioner makes with respect to the penalties is that since certain portions of the required -- since certain portions of the order for the required report sought information to which the Commission was not entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.035" offset="21383502">Therefore, it didn't -- the petitioner didn't need to comply with any part of the report.</text>

            <text syncTime="5884.133" offset="23639855">It seems to us that the Bowman Dairy case is distinguishable from this one on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5892.073" offset="23671620">In the first place, in the Bowman Dairy case, the Government employee who've been served with the subpoena was put in a dilemma that I think call for some exercise of clemency by the Court, he either had to disobey the Attorney General or disobey the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="5914.734" offset="23762317">In the second place, in the Bowman Dairy case, the Government and the individual served with the subpoena had done everything they could to challenge the subpoena short with non-compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5928.792" offset="23818533">And in this case, we say that there was a remedy under Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act that the petitioner did not invoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="5939.680" offset="23862105">Third, in the Bowman Dairy case, the Court was dealing not with a money penalty, but with an individual's liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5950.936" offset="23907140">And it seems to me that there are -- there's an occasion for a more liberal role in that connection that there is in dealing simply with the penal (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.478" offset="23957295">Now, I think there's one further reason of we're not extending the Bowman Dairy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.425" offset="23981119">The Bowman Dairy case cited no authority and so far as my researches go which I'm not sure they are complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.610" offset="24013824">The Bowman Dairy case is contra to the whole tenor of authority in other courts on a similar problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.263" offset="24044440">And adding those together, we think that's clearly sufficient ground for not extending the Bowman Dairy case to cover this situation.</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="6240.720" stopTime="6585.025">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="6240.720" offset="25066245">Because in the income tax case, there's an exception that could be made by the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="6245.682" offset="25086098">A further point I think which the Federal Trade Commission and others, frankly, a considerable course, is that when the Congress did wish to give such a privilege, it apparently knew how to do it because with respect to some of the reports which must be made in the Interstate Commerce Commission dealing with accidents which might be brought in question and litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6269.279" offset="25180453">The statute expressly says that they are not to be subject to subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="6277.491" offset="25213367">And I -- I think to, I want to make it quite clear that there's an entirely -- an entirely intelligible view of policy behind the Commission's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6289.162" offset="25259969">I say intelligible, not necessarily right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6292.389" offset="25272926">The Commission's view is that the policy behind this statute is one of preventing indiscriminate publicity, preventing the employees of the Census Bureau from giving this out for private advantage or as a matter of favor or just plain carelessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6311.174" offset="25348054">But they say, once this information becomes material in an administrative or judicial proceeding, then it is a strong public policy that we almost recognize in favor of having that information available so that the case maybe decided on the best possible evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6333.587" offset="25437706">And this is a matter again, I think it must be conceded, of very great importance in the administration of the antitrust laws, after all to get a picture of the market structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6345.822" offset="25486712">The Bureau of the Census' universe figures and the breakdown among the several companies is the best way to get a picture of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6356.773" offset="25530493">Now, why do I disagree if I may take a minute on that?</text>
            <text syncTime="6360.478" offset="25545331">I think that the words are not so clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.405" offset="25564975">Well, my view has the worst of it on the words, are not so clear as to forbid us to look farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="6371.874" offset="25590888">For example, to some cases that the words don't seem to cover which I -- where I think the information is clearly frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="6378.936" offset="25619101">Suppose that a company has signed its census report, but hasn't gotten to mail yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6384.752" offset="25642402">It's incredible that it should be subject to subpoena under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6388.957" offset="25659225">Or suppose it's returned to the company to make a correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6392.849" offset="25674794">I would think it's plain that the privilege attached to it then.</text>
            <text syncTime="6397.251" offset="25692348">It would seem to me that the policy underlying Section 9 of the census is broader than the one that I suggest it could be attributed to it that its policy in -- might I take just a minute Your Honor to develop that?</text>
            <text syncTime="6416.311" offset="25768626">That its policy is -- well, the colloquial way to put it is to make sure that the statistical activities of the Government leave those who cooperate neither better off or worse off than they would be if the statistical activities weren't engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="6435.379" offset="25844903">To put it more specifically, I think that the policy is to remove the objections or otherwise, it would be to the census, the public objection arising from a sense of unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.078" offset="25903731">If the Government gathered this information, I've got you to cooperate and then ride away from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6456.599" offset="25929749">On the other hand, the second purpose is to secure the cooperation of those reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="6464.101" offset="25959737">These retained copies are in the operations of the Census Bureau of very, very great importance in order to get accurate figures for reasons spelled out in our brief at greater length.</text>
            <text syncTime="6476.926" offset="26011042">There must be consultations between the Census experts and the company, economist, and statistician, and unless the company has a copy available, the consultations can be carried out only under very great difficulty if at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6497.346" offset="26092753">And therefore, it would seem to me that the policy of Section 9 is one that says that this information gathered by the Government for statistical purposes shall be used only for statistical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6518.291" offset="26176554">And there's evidence in that -- of that in presidential proclamations and committee reports cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6525.540" offset="26205497">And that would bring this case down to the question whether these retained copies fall within the category of information requested by the Government for statistical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6538.234" offset="26256280">One can argue at great length as to whether the companies would keep the copies even so the Government didn't ask them to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6549.708" offset="26302255">But the fact is that the Commerce Department does ask them to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6554.538" offset="26321481">And in my judgment, where the Commerce Department says, “Keep this for our purposes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6561.942" offset="26351156">And then it does not lie in the Government's mouth to say, “Oh, you would have kept it anyway, and this isn't something that was done.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6571.414" offset="26388982">For the Government's purposes, you would have kept it for your own use, maybe so, often so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.048" offset="26415522">But I think that where the Government has said, “Keep it,” the Government must acknowledge that it was kept because it wanted to.</text>

            <text syncTime="6685.121" offset="26843826">Our position and one which we -- which I should have made clearer and that sought to emphasize in the brief is that, certainly, the underlying information, this information underlying a census report is not a privilege just because somebody has made a report of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6704.301" offset="26920626">Indeed, if you will look at the original request for information here, you will see that they asked for the same kinds of information that was given to the Census Bureau even referred to the Census Code numbers to show what they wanted and then the company came back and said, "Well, here are the retained copies of our reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="6722.279" offset="26992515">Why make us do it all over again?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6724.002" offset="26999411">Now, there is this difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6725.190" offset="27004113">While much of the information could be obtained, it would be a slower and in some ways more difficult process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6734.182" offset="27040057">Some of the information given to the Census Bureau contains estimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6739.583" offset="27061687">There are estimates where you could give a number of figures and sometimes honestly and haven't come out quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6748.525" offset="27097422">When the Federal Trade Commission sought to get it, of course, counsel would screen it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6754.310" offset="27120619">When it goes to Bureau of the Census, it is more candid and they go to more work to put it together.</text>
            <text syncTime="6763.854" offset="27158758">So that there would be -- there would be in my judgment, this again as a matter of argument, there would be in my judgment a considerable hampering of the Federal Trade Commission's processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6777.780" offset="27214451">On the other hand, I think there would be a considerable hampering of the statistical processes if you held that there was no privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="6784.944" offset="27243186">That's why there are these different views.</text>
            <text syncTime="6788.245" offset="27256351">Now, if I might say just one sentence or two if I may, one is that although I did not take time to deal with the problem of waiver because I thought I should get to the merits of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6802.657" offset="27314030">We do insist that the voluntary furnishing of copies of census report had destroyed the privilege of confidentiality.</text>

            <text syncTime="6852.321" offset="27512665">In the first place, these census reports are merely testaments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6856.681" offset="27530115">They're not evidence of what was manufactured, and sold, and shipped in commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="7036.161" offset="28248064">25, F.Supp. 329, it's at page 26, Your Honor of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7046.459" offset="28289233">Now, I think I've made it clear that there was no latitude allowed us here but I'd like also to answer the Chief Justice's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="7060.624" offset="28345866">There is no doubt, Your Honor that the same information so far as the call for documents would have been called for by a subpoena duces tecum.</text>
            <text syncTime="7071.387" offset="28388916">And if you will recall in the opinion of the District Judge Ryan, he so regarded these, the substantial equivalent of a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="7080.696" offset="28426115">Now, I think the law is perfectly clear that the administrative agency has no power of its own to attempt to enforce a subpoena duces tecum.</text>
            <text syncTime="7091.077" offset="28467702">It must go to a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7093.544" offset="28477524">I hope Your Honor sincerely that on this review, this Court will give consideration to a provision of the law that has not received in my humble opinion adequate attainment in the appellate courts and that is provisions of Section 6 of the Administrative Procedure Act passed in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="7116.284" offset="28568534">And that deals with the power to issue subpoenas, it does, the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7125.623" offset="28605837">Now, there's a very vast distinction however that if a subpoena is issued and it disobeyed, there is a very limited liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="7138.268" offset="28656410">But punishable as the Court, it must be after a Court determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="7143.312" offset="28676577">The Commission here wants to arrogate to itself the power to determined that it shall be the final arbiter of usual paid penalties to this corporation for not answering our particular questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7157.142" offset="28731956">Now, the extent of the questions, the learned Solicitor General read from his draft and I'm sure he was innocent and didn't mean to attempt to point out that these were addressed in his Appendix D, the St. Regis Paper Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="7175.688" offset="28806144">He refers to (Inaudible) orders, only two orders were directed to the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7182.290" offset="28832580">The seven other orders with other corporations, they were not named defendants in the action, only St. Regis Paper Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="7189.251" offset="28860374">And only penalties and forfeitures were claimed against St. Regis Paper Company, no one else.</text>
            <text syncTime="7194.959" offset="28883257">I'd submit to you that our glass at the end of our brief deals and shows the fairer picture and they're taken right from the Government's own total figures but we deal only with orders one and seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="7217.044" offset="28971551">And I therefore suggest that the Court not be mislead by this extent of one enforceability which was as shown on page 3B of our appendix to our brief, the correct situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7232.397" offset="29032991">Now, those that were unenforceable were the determination of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7237.114" offset="29051800">The Court found that it wasn't necessary to order a compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7244.175" offset="29080116">They were just as able as was my client to find that information in their own file.</text>
            <text syncTime="7250.598" offset="29105716">They have copies of all the data that was available to our client.</text>
            <text syncTime="7257.210" offset="29132257">It's expensive to a corporation to have to make these searches and file all this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="7263.194" offset="29156185">And we have it and they shouldn't be duplicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="7266.113" offset="29167783">Now, I think the Court could take judicial notice of one more fact, and that is that in the Congress 1958, if I'm not wrong, 1959 as well as 1960, bills have been introduced entitled the premerger notification bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="7284.243" offset="29240299">The Commission has supported those bills vigorously.</text>
            <text syncTime="7287.290" offset="29252524">They have not been reported out and not have enacted into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7291.090" offset="29267780">They would require a corporation to give notice to the Commission of any proposed merger or acquisition of stock and you couldn't act for 90 days, a few satisfied certain amounts as to the assets to be acquired before competing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7305.866" offset="29326817">That would be a very serious interference with the exercise of a lawful right and it's never been made into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7313.752" offset="29358373">Now, at this proposal that the Commission asserts here and I believe it's the first time that it's ever been brought before a District Court, that it may have this answer -- these answers in writing, all of these specific question under the penalty of these forfeitures, there won't be any necessity or any premerger bill of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7335.531" offset="29445517">They'll have something more better and more powerful.</text>
            <text syncTime="7339.185" offset="29460146">And I say that the policy that's behind this should not be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="7346.794" offset="29490552">I think Your Honor there's only one more point to make and that is that the District Court could not order obedience to the Commission's entire order.</text>
            <text syncTime="7362.855" offset="29554813">It could not grant mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="7365.079" offset="29563695">That was a determination by the learned district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="7370.217" offset="29584280">And he had very good reasons as he stated in his opinion and the Government did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="7377.115" offset="29611865">It seems to me therefore that the District Courts having applied all the fair cast as to whether or not there should have been forfeitures, the District Court's determination should be fully respected.</text>

            <text syncTime="7516.522" offset="30169422">In -- well, I -- well, Your Honor, I endeavored to give the answer to that a moment ago that the test must be -- the ability to satisfy a district judge whether or not the questions as presented are capable of enforcement by a Court order of mandamus on the whole of the questions that are presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="7586.016" offset="30447470">I think that the questions of Justice Whittaker, you can't designate something, this is a special report and then actually set forth questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7599.006" offset="30499401">My -- my suggestion is that where the Commission, did file as they did here, such a number of particular requests that -- and in answers to questions, some called them questions, that is a request for answers in writing to a specific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="7620.424" offset="30585083">Now, if they want to report, I think that they could say, “Furnish a report as to your organization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7627.946" offset="30615176">Every business would know what that means and it does give the corporation a certain latitude.</text>

            <text syncTime="7655.970" offset="30727293">The question is whether or not, it seems to me, the Commission is really trying to do by request for answers in writing to a specific questions, what really ought to be asked by a subpoena duces tecum.</text>
            <text syncTime="7671.391" offset="30788942">That would certainly be one test.</text>
