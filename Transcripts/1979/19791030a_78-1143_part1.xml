            <text syncTime="89.798" offset="359131">The Appellee in this case, Laurence Terrazas, was born in the United States in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.507" offset="385985">In 1970, he took an oath of allegiance to Mexico, in which he explicitly renounced his allegiance to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.072" offset="416287">He contends that despite this act he remains a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.610" offset="434364">The United States contends that by that act he expatriated himself, and is no longer a citizen of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.675" offset="466651">The facts of the case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.930" offset="475638">Because Appellee was born in this country of a Mexican parent, he was a citizen of this country under the Fourteenth Amendment, and a citizen of Mexico under Mexican Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.961" offset="515762">In 1968, he left this country to attend college in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.912" offset="535615">In September of 1970, at age 22, he signed an application for a certificate of Mexican nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.034" offset="568111">This application is a one-page document of three paragraphs, the most important of which reads in pertinent part, as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.899" offset="595592">I quote "I, therefore, hereby expressly renounce United States citizenship, as well as any submission, obedience and loyalty to any foreign government, especially to that of the United States of America," or North America, depending on the translation.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.052" offset="664137">This was in 1970, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.799" offset="683154">In September of 1970, he signed this application, by his own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.399" offset="705515">Continuing the quotation "And, furthermore, I swear adherence, obedience and submission to the Laws and Authorities of the Mexican Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.473" offset="745848">"This application was duly submitted to the Mexican Government, and on April 3, 1971, that government issued the Appellee a certificate of Mexican nationality, which repeated that Appellee had sworn allegiance to Mexico and had renounced allegiance to any other government.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.971" offset="811781">Appellee received the certificate in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.944" offset="827768">There matters stood for approximately four months, until August of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.560" offset="850233">At that time, Appellee visited the American Consulate in Monterey, Mexico, and told the Consular Officer there that he felt more Mexican than American, that he intended to stay in Mexico, and that he was concerned about holding two citizenships.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.622" offset="914390">The Consular Officer told the Appellee that there was nothing illegal in holding dual citizenship, but he warned Appellee not to obtain a certificate of Mexican nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.266" offset="953051">Appellee revealed at that point that he had, in fact, received such a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.915" offset="971651">The Consular Officer told him that he had probably expatriated himself, but that a final determination could be made only by the Department of State in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.994" offset="1011879">At the Consular Officer's suggestion, the Appellee took with him forms to fill out, so that a determination of his citizenship could be made, and he returned to the Consulate two months later with those papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.263" offset="1060989">Because expatriation is a sensitive matter, these forms essentially consisted of three documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.395" offset="1085544">First, an affidavit in which the individual describes the possibly expatriating act second, a lengthy questionnaire designed to elicit the factual background and the individual state of mind and third, a letter in which the individual can state whatever he wishes about the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.113" offset="1160359">The Appellee executed an affidavit in which he stated that his oath of allegiance to Mexico was, and I quote "My free and voluntary act, and that no influence, compulsion, force or duress was exerted upon me by any other person, and that it was done with the intention of relinquishing my United States citizenship," end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.693" offset="1242697">In the questionnaire, the Appellee gave conflicting answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.464" offset="1257848">He stated that he had taken the oath, "willingly and voluntarily."</text>
            <text syncTime="318.943" offset="1275716">He also stated, and I quote "There comes a time in everyone's life when he has to sit down and decide what he wants to do with his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.362" offset="1305391">I did this and decided that my future happiness was here in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.504" offset="1322005">For that reason, I became a Mexican," end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.093" offset="1336320">On the other hand, the questionnaire asked, "Did you intend by this oath or affirmation to abandon your allegiance to the United States, or transfer your allegiance to the foreign state?"</text>
            <text syncTime="344.326" offset="1377280">And the Appellee answered, "No."</text>
            <text syncTime="346.893" offset="1387520">And in his letter he said, at one point, "By taking this oath, I did not consider that I was relinquishing my rights as an American citizen."</text>

            <text syncTime="364.935" offset="1459722">This was after the visit to the Consulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.725" offset="1478844">These papers were submitted to the Department of State, which determined that Appellee had expatriated himself, under 8 U.S. Code 1481 (a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="378.676" offset="1514684">That statute provides that a citizen shall lose his citizenship, by "taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state."</text>

            <text syncTime="393.571" offset="1574243">On the expatriating act point, the document he signed which you read really kind of contains two different thoughts, one, that he swore an oath of allegiance to Mexico, and secondly, that he renounced his United States citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.542" offset="1646132">In other words, it's the oath of allegiance, rather than the renunciation, that is legally significant, because it was not before a Consular Officer, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="418.441" offset="1673718">That is entirely correct, Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.715" offset="1686779">The expatriating act here is the oath of allegiance to Mexico, although we do contend that the State Department was entitled to consider the circumstances under which it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.407" offset="1725544">But the expatriating act is not the renouncing of United States citizenship, because, as you state, the statute requires that that be done in front of a United States officer, which in this case it was not.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.187" offset="1792731">The record shows that he was very fluent in Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.451" offset="1801718">That was his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.143" offset="1816555">The State Department issued the Appellee a certificate of loss of nationality, certifying that he was no longer an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.424" offset="1845603">When the Appellee received the certificate, he went to the Consular Officer in Mexico and asked what he could do to get his American citizenship back.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.400" offset="1881548">The Consular Officer advised an administrative appeal within the Department of State, and Appellee took such an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.859" offset="1907357">The Board of Appellate Review, following a hearing, issued an opinion affirming the issuance of the certificate of loss of nationality, and the Appellee then brought this action for a declaration of his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.568" offset="1962214">At this point, let me refer to the statute that Congress enacted to prescribe rules of evidence for proceedings such as the one Appellee commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.752" offset="1990949">It is 8 United States Code 1481(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="502.091" offset="2008294">It provides two things, both of which the Court of Appeals held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.680" offset="2030655">First, it states that in any action where loss of United States nationality is at issue, the party claiming that such loss has occurred -- in this case, that is the Government has the burden of proving such loss by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.623" offset="2098469">The second provision proceeds on a premise that is not in the statute itself, but that the Government has always recognized, namely that no act can be expatriating unless it is done voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.253" offset="2144967">Thus, the second provision of the statute states that any person who performs an expatriating act -- in this case, taking an oath of allegiance to Mexico -- shall be presumed to have done so voluntarily, but the presumption may be rebutted on a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the act was not performed voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.280" offset="2237022">The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois held a four-day trial, de novo, on the question whether Appellee had lost his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.927" offset="2271608">Faithful to the statute's standard, the court held that the United States had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Appellee had taken the oath of allegiance to Mexico, and that Appellee had not rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence the presumption that such an act was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.124" offset="2340467">On the Appellee's appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.086" offset="2356245">It specifically stated that assuming the District Court had applied the proper standard or proof, the record fully supported its findings that Appellee had voluntarily taken the oath of allegiance to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.809" offset="2403161">And it recognized that the standards that the District Court had applied were those that the statute commanded it to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.977" offset="2431896">But the Court of Appeals held the statute unconstitutional under the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.355" offset="2457391">The Court of Appeals concluded that that clause, as construed by this Court in Afroyim v. Rusk, required that the Government prove by clear and convincing evidence that Appellee had voluntarily committed an expatriating act, and that he had done so with the specific intent of relinquishing his citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.616" offset="2546416">Those are two different issues, Mr. Justice, in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.884" offset="2559478">The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court for a determination of whether the evidence in this case met the higher standard of proof that the Court of Appeals had formulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.281" offset="2597094">And the United States took this appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.967" offset="2619768">The questions that this Court must decide are three.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.913" offset="2635651">First, whether an act of expatriation to be valid, as such, must be undertaken with a specific intent to surrender American citizenship, or whether, as we contend, a citizen may lose his citizenship, regardless of his specific intent, if he voluntarily performs an act that is both designated by Congress as expatriating and that inherently manifests a transfer of allegiance to another country, that is inconsistent with retention of American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.334" offset="2761247">Second, whether Congress may constitutionally provide, as it has done in 8 USUSC 1481(c), that in a lawsuit where loss of citizenship is at issue, the party claiming expatriation may prove such expatriation by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.041" offset="2828121">We submit that such a standard of proof is not inconsistent with the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.419" offset="2865633">The third issue that this Court must decide is whether Congress may constitutionally provide, as it has done in that same statute, that an act once shown to have been done, is presumed to have been done voluntarily, unless the party claiming that no expatriation has occurred shows by a preponderance of the evidence that it was not done voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.080" offset="2952255">We believe that such a presumption is constitutional, at least on the assumption that expatriation does not require a showing of specific intent to surrender citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.260" offset="3161025">The statute says that voluntariness must be shown by a preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.010" offset="3179938">And it says that the voluntariness of the act is presumed, unless shown to the contrary by a preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.640" offset="3202508">The question then would become Does voluntariness, in that context, mean specific intent?</text>
