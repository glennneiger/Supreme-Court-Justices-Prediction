            <text syncTime="1686.143" offset="6848951">Twenty years ago, approximately, the Surgeon General of the United States said that if spinach, as sold in the supermarkets, was as dangerous as cigarette smoking, and the prevalance of cigarette smoke in the atmosphere, he, the Surgeon General, would take it off the market in 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.861" offset="6935886">Now, since then, the Department of HEW has pursued that up to the most recently resigned Secretary of HEW.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.847" offset="8043792">Nonetheless, there is a concrete example where, at least statistically significant evidence, such as the type that the Fifth Circuit seemed to want, showed that there was a risk at those low levels of exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.417" offset="8094051">In addition, the Stallone study, which was actually one of the negative studies that was presented by industry, in which is also showed an excess risk of leukemia, something like 21 versus 20 that should have occurred, that one was not statistically significant, but, nonetheless, there is evidence that there is an excess risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.792" offset="8183599">It's unclear exactly what the risk -- the exposure levels were, but it was in the refining industry, where those companies are already at or almost below the one part per million standard now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.403" offset="8242009">In addition, there was scientific testimony that there is, in general, a dose-response relationship -- that means less exposure to carcinogens is better.</text>

            <text syncTime="2199.990" offset="8904370">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.244" offset="8917326">What I plan to do with the time allocated to me is to highlight to the Court our belief that Section 6(b)(5) of the Act is in fact the focus and contains the charters and indeed the command to the Secretary of Labor as to how he should set and how he must set standards governing occupational exposure to toxic substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.942" offset="9024115">However, in order to frame the argument, I think that it's important to keep in mind that we bring to this Court a Secretary of Labor's determination, based on findings of fact, supported by substantial evidence which was not upset by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.534" offset="9098512">That not only determined that exposure to benzene causes leukemia or cancer, that not only that hundreds of workers had already died of cancer, and that indeed 30,000 or more workers will be exposed to this hazard every single day of their working life and that, based on experts scientific opinion testimony, the determination was made that there is no level, there is no level that can be considered safe for employees who are in fact exposed to benzene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.398" offset="9253992">Now, the Secretary of Labor didn't rest on that, the Secretary endeavored to ascertain what that would mean in terms of the risk, the magnitude of the risk on employees in this work place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.452" offset="9314179">The Secretary just didn't say, "Let's forget about it", the Secretary endeavored to do that and took an enormous amount of testimony, and ended up concluding that there simply was no way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.506" offset="9370394">There was no way to make an educated estimate or to quantify the benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.326" offset="9597659">Engineering controls, work practices -- in other words, a whole series of items have evolved during the proceedings, in which companies come in, engineering experts come in, plant superintendents come in, and they say, Now, what can we do to eliminate?</text>

            <text syncTime="2404.546" offset="9722629">And, for example, in the Appendix, at page 141 in this case, there's discussion about the need to replace burners, the need to replace pumps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.623" offset="9770904">There are systems, as the product goes through the plant where these emissions are detectable, and where possible, feasible, available kinds of things can be done, and customarily what's grown up, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is a series of things that are done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.570" offset="9846659">You look to see hood ventilating machinery equipment, you look at what kind of work practices can be brought to bear you look at a whole slew of possible ways to deal with the hazard, and that ends up in a determination on the record by the Secretary as to what level can be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.024" offset="9924504">For example, in many of these standards, employers have -- or certain employers in an industry have reached a certain level and they bring people who testify, and under direct and cross-examination it is explained and determined on what basis they were able to reach that level and those kinds of findings in turn become the predicate for the Secretary's technological feasibility determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2524.169" offset="10201088">I think we have to see what was going on in Congress's mind when they passed this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.768" offset="10227419">And what was going on in Congress's mind was this parade of experiences had demonstrated that there were all these known toxic substances cut there, that indeed with the new technology and processes coming to the fore, it was expected that every twenty seconds another substance, a potentially toxic substance was going to be introduced into the working environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.464" offset="10326267">And, as you know, Your Honor, there is no protesting requirement under this statute or any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.704" offset="10351240">So the Congress of the United States knew and understood this, and they knew another thing they knew that the state of the scientific knowledge at this point in time was such that since most of these particular diseases had what we refer to as a long latency period -- in other words, 20 or more years from the time that you initially begin to inhale these particular substances until the disease actually manifests itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.038" offset="10452595">That they knew that there was not going to be immediate, imminent scientific certainty in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.326" offset="10481748">And in the face of that, and because the Congress decided that the overriding concern here had to be to maximize the protection to employee work, even in the face of the scientific uncertainty, they, in 6(b)(5), started out, not only with the mandates of the Secretary -- and I want to discuss that mandate -- but with the use of a very carefully chosen phrase, we believe, "best available evidence."</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.505" offset="10586446">In other words, what this Congress contemplated that the Secretary, on the basis of a record submitted before him, would take the best available evidence, everything that the Secretary knew for sure, and also having to deal with the reality that things would not be known.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.877" offset="10659903">And, for example, in response to Mr. Justice Stevens' question, one of the things that was not known here was what would happen to employees who were currently exposed at 10 ppm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.192" offset="10713192">And I believe the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion at Pet-Ap 18a was a correct statement, but it misses the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.185" offset="10741091">It was correct in this sense there is no direct empirical evidence as to what would happen to people at 10 ppm, because the vast majority of people today have been exposed in excess of that number, and there have been no studies that have demonstrated what would happen to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.965" offset="10816219">There was no direct empirical evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.915" offset="10824056">Worse than that, there is no reason to believe there will be such direct empirical evidence for many years to come, precisely because of the problem with the latency period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.232" offset="10865330">In 1971 the statute was passed, but for anyone to make an intelligent and rational judgment as to what the impact will be, they have to take into consideration we have a latency period here of approximately 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.925" offset="10924053">So that any study, any study that would begin to say there is no problem at 10 ppm unless there was a latency period of a minimum of 20 years, certainly could not be a valid basis for going ahead and regulating.</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.109" offset="13312794">I have been allotted 35 minutes to argue the main issue presented by the decision below my colleague, Mr. Lettow, will argue for ten minutes exclusively on the dermal exposure issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.183" offset="13369114">But this case is far simpler, I believe, than my opponents have made it appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.007" offset="13392415">The Fifth Circuit held that the -- that OSHA must shoulder the affirmative burden of showing, by substantial evidence, that its standard is reasonably necessary and otherwise complies with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.382" offset="13465976">Here OSHA failed to show that the standard would do any discernible good, and the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.025" offset="13504533">The decision and the result reached by the Fifth Circuit should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.584" offset="13526685">Congress wanted OSHA to issue standards that are reasonably necessary to protect workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.742" offset="13563361">My opponent, Mr. Alsup, has suggested that that provision is nothing more than a broad enabling statute -- broad enabling provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.629" offset="13610904">But, in fact, there is in this very statute enabling language in another provision which says -- this is Section 8(g)(2) which says that OSHA may issue such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.055" offset="13676628">I don't believe, when Congress has so clearly used enabling type language, one can construe a reference, such as in 3(8) as an enabling provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.355" offset="13721767">Quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.631" offset="13726887">The term "reasonably necessary" has consistently and uniformly been construed by the Court, First Circuit, in the Bean case and the Fifth Circuit in the Aqua Slide case, to be fully consistent with what this Court held in the Benzene case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.547" offset="13802538">Now, the purpose that Congress wanted OSHA to follow, namely, to set reasonably necessary standards, is carried forward in Section 6(b)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.708" offset="13859276">That provision intends for the Secretary to set feasible standards which, the legislative history shows, were to encompass reasonable and practical steps, to control material health hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.579" offset="13938688">Such standards are also to be based not on views evidenced in arguments, and there is a great deal of legislative history, or some legislative history about this but instead on substantial evidence and the best-available evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.402" offset="14002009">The Fifth Circuit -- and in each of these instances, the determinations on these issues are required by the statute to be supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.739" offset="14043387">The Fifth Circuit, in light of these provisions, held essentially two things it held that OSHA must show that its standard will produce discernible benefits and, secondly, that there is some reasonable relationship between the benefits expected and the cost of the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.112" offset="14136801">My opponents have both mentioned that there are, as Mr. Alsup said, thousands of carcinogens in the work place, I believe he said, and Mr. Cohen noted the Congress envisioned every twenty seconds a new chemical going into the work place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.325" offset="14213705">Now, it's our position that the statute expected OSHA to be reasonable under the circumstances, and that if the over-all aims of the statute, which are to protect workers, are going to be achieved, they can only be achieved if there is a judgment made that each individual standard is going to accomplish some discernible good, and is going to benefit the worker, because obviously unless that sort of determination, that sort of reasonableness determination is made with every standard in the first instance, what you're going to find is, ten years from now, industry will have spent fortunes to control what could turn out to be de minimis, or hazards which really are not terribly significant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3585.276" offset="14445464">But let's first try to answer the question, were there discernible benefits here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.163" offset="14465003">We've talked a lot back and forth about the question of whether there is any evidence under a hundred parts per million -- and I say a hundred parts per million because there's really no evidence below a hundred parts per million -- as Mr. Justice Stevens noted, the Fifth Circuit said there was no empirical evidence below ten.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.964" offset="14540236">My opponents have brought up the Dow study.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.682" offset="14555073">I felt that with their reply brief we had seen the end of last-minute ex post facto rationalizations of counsel, but we have yet a new study brought on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.616" offset="14594884">And I just call your attention to page 15 of the Joint Appendix, which is EPA's interpretation of that study.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.341" offset="14629784">It says that the Ott study, that's the Dow study, indicated no excess risk of leukemia with relatively well-documented exposures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.847" offset="14671788">I cross-examined the witnesses for Dow in the proceeding, and I will tell you that there is evidence that some of the exposures in that instance were up in several hundred parts per million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.854" offset="14711808">They varied all over the lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.488" offset="14718391">There were different groups of workers exposed to different amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.018" offset="14732497">I don't believe I've really answered your question, though, because, coming back to the question of discernible benefits, we feel that here there are no demonstrated benefits whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.569" offset="14770636">There is no empirical evidence of any harm under a hundred parts per million.</text>

            <text syncTime="3695.811" offset="14887664">In fact, we think that standard is providing fully adequate protection to the workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.821" offset="14911697">Coming to the question of whether those benefits ought to be quantifiable or not, our position on that issue is that it's controlled by what the best-available evidence is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.076" offset="14956732">Now, in this instance, you'll recall that the Environmental Protection Agency did quantify the benefit, was able to make estimates of what the standard would accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.880" offset="15007932">The same was true of Dr. Wilson, EPA's own contractor in this case, who testified that it could conduct a cost-effectiveness type analysis which would encompass some sort of estimate of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.424" offset="15054117">The Fifth Circuit noted that in its decision and was fully aware of the capability in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.021" offset="15088494">So I think in answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, the best-available evidence language is controlling with respect to the degree to which quantification can occur but I think the evidence is overwhelming in this case that such quantification can indeed be done, because it was done by EPA's sister agency, the Environmental Protection Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.489" offset="15178355">Now, the important thing, I think, here is that if you carefully analyze what the Fifth Circuit said, it boils down to really three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.732" offset="15243348">It says, first of all, that the agency must carefully consider and address any evidence on benefits submitted by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.845" offset="15295801">Secondly, it should attempt to estimate, as well as possible, what the standard is intended to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.950" offset="15328193">And third, it ought to explain and justify the standard which it ultimately promulgates in terms of what it is expected to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.480" offset="15366332">What is this going to accomplish for the worker?</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.087" offset="15376781">Now, I submit that no one can seriously contend that that was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.058" offset="15396634">I don't think any of those things was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.946" offset="15416174">It's probably the best evidence, perhaps, that this wasn't done in this case is that the Secretary has felt called upon to submit a very lengthy addendum to its reply brief, which sets forth what I think it wishes it had said but didn't say about benefits in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.112" offset="15488794">To me this tests the limits of what the ex post facto rationalization of counsel doctrine must mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.499" offset="15526410">This takes it awfully, awfully far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.510" offset="15538427">Now, Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked a question earlier about how feasibility was determined in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.512" offset="15582417">I think that bears a short discussion, because here's what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.247" offset="15605405">The Secretary said, We have a health hazard here, and the Secretary said to the contractor, not should we set a standard at one or five or ten, and what's feasible, or even one-half what he said is, We're talking about a one part per million standard, can you go out and show us that industry can come up with the hardware to accomplish this, and that it won't drive the industry out of business, or it won't require the industry to be shut down?</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.914" offset="15728076">That's all that happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.406" offset="15734032">There was no consideration of alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.575" offset="15742704">The contractor was given no discretion to look at any of the questions which we're talking about here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.741" offset="15771335">It is for that very reason, of course, that we presented evidence and discussed this question at length in the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.811" offset="15799651">The kind of evidence we presented -- and I might add that the Council on Wage and Price Stability was weighing in there on exactly the same basis -- was that this statute is sufficiently flexible to permit the kinds of things that the Fifth Circuit said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.598" offset="15854822">We're not talking about elaborate cost-benefit analyses, what we're talking about is reasoned, rational decision-making in a situation where Congress wanted ultimately the most protection for workers to be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.960" offset="15908216">But that can't be accomplished by taking a tunnel vision approach as was taken in this case to one hazard, and a hazard, indeed, where the evidence strongly suggests we don't have nearly as great a problem as we've had with others, and will probably have with others in the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="4004.299" offset="16121584">Now we have to ask what was "feasible" intended to accomplish?</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.700" offset="16135168">Let me talk about the legislative history for a minute, because I think there are two key points on the legislative history which tell us that Congress wanted that term "feasible" to mean reasonable and practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.192" offset="16185114">Things that are really very consistent with Section 3(8), the "reasonably necessary" language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.219" offset="16209251">First, Senator Javits was the author of the original Administration bill on occupational health and safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.388" offset="16245927">It was submitted in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.009" offset="16256481">That bill provided for standards to be set by an independent board and the standards would be set based upon a report regarding the standard's feasibility, which the statute says in so many words would include reasonableness, practicality and technical feasibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.858" offset="16335788">Now, Senator Javits was the principal proponent of the feasibility amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.428" offset="16354074">He added it as an amendment in the Senate Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.653" offset="16367031">It is reasonable -- it is unreasonable in fact to assume anything else -- that when Senator Javits put that "feasibility" word in there, that is precisely what he meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.012" offset="16400468">He did not mean this to mean some sort of arbitrary business shutdown criterion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4086.625" offset="16450936">Well, I think what he meant was that the standard ultimately -- it's the ultimate objective we're talking about, the standard should be reasonably necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.451" offset="16486149">I think that's consistent with saying that it should be -- protect the worker to the extent feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.526" offset="16514466">Now, the ultimate objective is that the standard be reasonable, the standard be practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.430" offset="16534110">What the Fifth Circuit is doing is telling us how that objective can be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.571" offset="16558665">How that goal of reasonably necessary standards, how that goal of reasonable and practical standard can be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.475" offset="16586250">It's saying, first of all, that the agency must show some discernible benefit and, secondly, that there must be some reasonable relationship between the costs and the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.995" offset="16624389">And it's giving us a means of doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.259" offset="16641421">It seems to me that this whole approach is strongly supported also by the evidentiary requirement, including the substantial evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.111" offset="16688859">Congress put the substantial evidence test in for a very clear and important purpose, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.568" offset="16726685">Congress was concerned that the Secretary of Labor would issue arbitrary, unreasonable, unexplained, unsupportable standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.796" offset="16767540">Some of the original bills had the arbitrary and capricious review standard in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.594" offset="16786766">That was felt by Members in the House to be insufficient protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.261" offset="16805470">It was changed in the Senate to provide additional protection through the substantial evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4179.599" offset="16822815">I don't think there's any question that the -- the feeling was that in return for letting the Secretary of Labor establish the standards, that there needed to be guarantees so that the Secretary of Labor would not go overboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.519" offset="16886450">That's what I believe the substantial evidence test was for in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.497" offset="16902332">I make the same point to the second and third sentences of Section 6(b)(5), which, incidentally Mr. Alsup, contrary to his opening brief, now appears to concede, apply to both health and safety standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.043" offset="16968579">Those provisions were put into the statute in response to the concern stated in the House by the House minority members who had, I think, an immense power in this legislative debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.456" offset="17026257">The House originally passed the Daniels bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.078" offset="17040677">The Daniels bill was thought by the minority members to be too oriented towards the labor point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.182" offset="17077144">They ultimately passed through the House the Staggers-Sikes substitute, which was the new Administration bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.369" offset="17109849">In any event, the House minority members criticized the Daniels bill as allowing standards to be set on the basis of views and argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.442" offset="17150182">In the Senate that was remedied by including the second and third sentences of Section 6(b)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.876" offset="17175886">Those provisions require that standards be based on research demonstration and experiments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.969" offset="17208278">It requires that in addition to the health and safety protection, that the agency consider the latest scientific data in the field and the experience of other health and safety agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.015" offset="17264494">We think the experience of other health and safety agencies is very significant in this case, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.822" offset="17283720">We called, throughout the proceedings, to the Secretary's attention the fact that other agencies, and I include EPA as a prime example, were making the very kind of estimates of benefits that we're talking about in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.683" offset="17339099">That was never addressed in their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.347" offset="17349757">That point is still, I think, unaddressed by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.435" offset="17366162">Why EPA can engage in the kind of exercise that the Fifth Circuit contemplated and this agency can't is absolutely beyond any understanding, as far as I can see.</text>

            <text syncTime="4354.766" offset="17523419">The reasonably necessary clause applies to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.374" offset="17533868">The first sentence of section 6(b)(5) applies only to toxic substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.769" offset="17551423">The second and third sentences of section 6(b)(5) apply to both health and safety standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.349" offset="17573784">The third sentence of 6(b)(5) mentions feasibility, so that I think safety standards comprehend feasibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.911" offset="17600010">But I do think there's a difference, and I think that difference is why the debate arose and why there is a separate provision, and that is, section 2(b)(6) recognizes that there are differences in toxic substances because there are the problems that Mr. Cohen was referring to, the problems of determination of cause and effect relationships and determinations of latency period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.978" offset="17696350">I don't think that Congress wanted any different, you know, level of stringency of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.070" offset="17716726">But I do think that Congress wanted the agency to recognize, and I think the language of the first sentence of Section 6(b)(5) does this, however inartfully, that there were going to be somewhat different problems presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="4460.134" offset="17944931">There are going to be industries where it's very dangerous work in those industries, if you're working on tall buildings or construction projects, obviously it's a terribly, terribly dangerous thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.382" offset="18001878">And I think the Secretary should be equally concerned about those hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.947" offset="18016193">I think Congress was equally concerned about those hazards, really, because the legislative history reveals a discussion of, I think it was, 14,000 deaths a year and some 600,000 injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.065" offset="18064677">And most of those obviously are related to health and safety problems, related to construction accidents and so forth and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="4503.392" offset="18117966">I think it's significant, though, once again, to point out that the Secretary's opening brief seemed to pin almost its entire case upon some distinction between toxic substances and safety standards, and now I think they concede, if I understand Mr. Alsup correctly, that safety standards are covered by the second and third sentences of section 5(b)(5), and it seems to me the reference to feasibility there must mean that we're talking about roughly comparable levels of stringency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.569" offset="18250668">I don't want to leave the substantial evidence test without a little more discussion, because I think that is so critical to the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4555.522" offset="18326528">Now, it's important to recognize that industry in this case has looked, and looked very hard, to discover whether there are any problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="4571.192" offset="18389117">To be sure, the Secretary has faulted the methodology of some of those studies, but every epidemiological study has the same problems, including the ones they are relying on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.246" offset="18429346">The studies we are talking about have been relied on by, for instance, the National Academy of Sciences, who felt that the Thorpe study which was done by the petroleum industry showed there just couldn't be any significant problem there, regardless of any minor methodological defects.</text>
