            <text syncTime="48.244" offset="297336">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.908" offset="312069">This case involves one question, the question of whether the First and the Fourteenth Amendments invalidates the provisions of Section 20, paren g, of Chapter 22 of the Schaumburg Village code.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.597" offset="370792">These sections require that as condition to receive a permit for charitable solicitation within the Village there must be presented a certified audit or other comparable evidence that 75 percent of the proceeds will be used directly for the charitable purposes of the organization seeking to solicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.226" offset="465251">The ordinance covers both door-to-door solicitation, and the use of public streets and public ways within the Village.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.584" offset="502763">The District Court held that specific provision, and that specific provision alone, to be unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.233" offset="541320">The action was initiated by declaratory judgment action brought by the Citizens for a Better Environment, an allegedly environmental group that sought a permit and complied with all other requirements of the ordinance except the 75 percent provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.868" offset="623867">On appeal the Seventh Circuit held that the ordinance was not necessarily unconstitutional on its face, as applied to what the Court said was the more traditional forms of charitable organizations; but nevertheless, sustained a summary judgment, and held that the statute in question--the ordinance in question was unconstitutional when applied to an organization which allegedly was involved in the dissemination of information and political discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.407" offset="770048">Our position here, Your Honors, is first, that the ordinance is not unconstitutional on its face; is not unconstitutional as applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.460" offset="926260">We allege as affirmative defense is the fact that a substantial portion of the funds in fact go to the solicitors and to the organizers of the group; and we suggest that a summary judgment was improperly granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.256" offset="985401">We think it's apparent from the Seventh Circuit's opinion that the Seventh Circuit had great problem with this issue; it in effect held that this ordinance was not unconstitutional on its face, but was unconstitutional as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.258" offset="1049454">And yet we suggest that they--that that court could not have reached that conclusion without some evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.798" offset="1071606">The only affidavits in support of the motion were the very skeleton affidavits which appear at page 40 and 43 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.823" offset="1119671">These affidavits, in essence, say that this organization was created under the laws of Illinois; that it's a not-for-profit organization; that they maintain a group of solicitors; and that they go from door to door; and that they give out environmental information, and take complaints.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.870" offset="1207860">This case was initiated by the CBE against 22 villages and cities in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.817" offset="1255612">Judge Marshall at the district level sustained summary judgments on a number of ordinances, most of which simply required a permit, and left discretion with either the police department or the village board.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.943" offset="1316216">Our ordinance, we believe, is substantially different from the other ordinances in question, because it does not vest any discretion in the administrative officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.322" offset="1361669">It sets forth what we believe to be definite standards guiding the issuance of a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.029" offset="1392494">And if the applicant meets all the requirements of the permit, the Village is required to issue a permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.800" offset="1431573">Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals treated the ordinance as, in fact, a mandatory requirement if all the conditions were met.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.681" offset="1639090">We view this, Your Honor, as not an attack on freedom of speech at all, but as a police power regulation in which the local community has made a determination that in order to protect its citizens both from physical danger, if you will, from annoyance, from disturbance in their homes; but also from what we've loosely referred to as fraud; that we have the right to require that when a terrible organization comes into town and says that it's soliciting for charity, that in fact it devotes a substantial portion of their funds to charity.</text>

            <text syncTime="818.403" offset="3378009">Because we recognize that there is a very serious problem--at least there was in Schaumberg--of people knocking on the doors at all hours of day and night.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.833" offset="3423775">And Your Honor, in the Hynes case said, that there's no constitutional right to knock on anybody's door on private premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.622" offset="3454913">We feel the legislative body made the determination that when all the funds go to a charitable purpose, we are willing, particularly in the light of the other requirements, to permit this invasion into the privacy and the possible threat to our householders.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.795" offset="3523563">But when organizations parade themselves in the mantle of charity, and in fact have an undisclosed amount going directly to the people who solicit the funds, rather than for the charitable purpose, then we have the right, as this Court has said over and over again, I think going back to Cantwell, going back to Martin, certainly in Hynes, indicating that this is--that these are very important public rights that the municipal government has full power to preserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.037" offset="3656579">As I indicate over and over again in my brief, I think the closest case before the Court of Appeals decision in this one was that Ft. Worth case in 1969 in the Fifth Circuit where the Court of Appeals there said that a municipality can deny permission to solicit if the cost of solicitation is excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.059" offset="3752605">And they, relying on cases that predated Hynes, actually recognized this Court's view that this was an important municipal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.812" offset="3799625">So our position, Your Honors, is simply that this is not a case of prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.538" offset="3822508">It's not a case of interference with freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.808" offset="3835674">We have no desire to keep CBE or anybody else from spreading the message.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.208" offset="3861274">Our desire, and we think this ordinance is a carefully drawn and a clear ordinance--our desire is simply to protect our householders from the problems of invasion of privacy, from fraud if you will, from misrepresentation, and to preserve what we feel is very important, a constitutional right, perhaps, almost as important as the First Amendment, that is the right to be left alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.995" offset="3980392">I think that in Hynes this Court quoted Professor Chafee writing back in 1945 where he indicated that this was the least likely type of expression to receive protection under the Sixth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.375" offset="12009911">I don't limit it to national; I'm simply speaking on behalf of a number of major, national voluntary charitable organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.230" offset="12049304">I suppose regional organizations, organizations which have to deal with large numbers of local regulations, which aren't simply soliciting in one area, and therefore can adopt their solicitation practices to the needs for that area or that municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.677" offset="12123073">Now, the court below declined to decide the reasonableness of the 75 percent requirement as applied to solicitation by traditional charitable organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.643" offset="12178975">The amici for whom I'm arguing include the major national traditional organizations, and the arbitrary percentage limit puts, I submit, an unconstitutional burden on these organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.024" offset="12240520">Solicitation, including door-to-door solicitation, is essential to the continuing existence of these organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.245" offset="12277405">And what these organizations are engaged in is communicating public means, whether advocacy or more traditional means; whether they're preaching environmentalism or whether they're selling Girl Scout cookies, or soliciting money for the Heart Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.566" offset="12358698">Solicitation involves their right to communicate, and it involves a citizen's right to receive that communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.628" offset="12398926">And I would even go so far as to suggest that on the citizen's side, contribution is a form of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.496" offset="12438424">There have been several references to Martin v. Struthers, which recognized the distinction and said that the community can't substitute its judgment for the judgment of the householder, the judgment in this case of spending 25 percent of contributions on what the village authorities deem to be administrative costs, is a bar to solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.856" offset="12539779">I do think one has to distinguish commercial organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.463" offset="12554198">That distinction was recognized in Schneider and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.214" offset="12565274">One has to distinguish governmental organizations which can call on the taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.231" offset="12589307">The amici for whom I speaking in many cases would have difficulty surviving under the regulations governing commercial peddlers' licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.137" offset="12632984">Now, I suggest that there are two reasons why the ordinance is an unreasonable restriction as applied to all charitable organizations, not just to advocacy organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.923" offset="12700066">The proportion of contributions that goes for fundraising is largely beyond organizations' control, beyond the control of the organization that's doing the fundraising.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.969" offset="12760252">For example, sometimes causes tend to attract large contributions from comparatively well-off people; other kinds tend to attract small contributions from lower income people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.711" offset="12807272">Some solicitation goes on in areas where population is concentration; others in areas where it's less concentrated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3761.059" offset="15148680">Well, I think if it was drafted in such a way as to make distinctions, if it was an outright prohibition, I suspect it would probably not violate the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.376" offset="15193924">I don't regard, in short, solicitation for funds alone as a violation--a prohibition of such solicitation as a violation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.884" offset="15235929">I find nothing in any of the cases that would indicate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.657" offset="15250975">And I think it's quite interesting--I've got at least a half a dozen briefs from the various amici, as well as Mr. Shadur, and I find no cases in any one of them that goes that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.001" offset="15300399">It's always, solicitation coupled with something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.867" offset="15319834">Our ordinance is not a prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.331" offset="15329761">Our ordinance doesn't care what your message is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.559" offset="15338642">God bless you with your message.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.539" offset="15346584">But when you start asking for money, then we say that the community, through its local officials, have a right to make a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.620" offset="15382841">And I would point out, because I know your Honors are well aware, that the Breard case said, in its substance, that the community could substitute the collective judgment for that of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.783" offset="15435504">And the mere fact that you post a sign that says, no solicitors, doesn't keep solicitors out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.637" offset="15458910">We had that no soliciting sign for four years in our ordinances before we adopted the present ordinance which is here in contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.931" offset="15492138">Because unfortunately, when commissioners--when solicitors work on a commission, they don't always pay attention to such signs, and unfortunately, bewildered housewives--and I don't mean to paint a horrible picture here--but it's a terrible burden on an individual housewife to have to go through the procedures, in Illinois at least, to file a complaint for trespassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.160" offset="15597046">I think it's unrealistic to say that the traditional remedies against fraud and trespass are sufficient to deal with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.786" offset="15635498">In the case of pure First Amendment freedoms, exercise of freedom of speech and freedom of religion, we certainly can say that that inconvenience is outweighed by the social benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.756" offset="15691400">But when the objective is to raise money, and most or a substantial portion of the money does not go to the charitable purpose, I suggest that the municipality and the interests of the public safety are entitled to enact the kind of ordinances we've enacted here without infringing upon the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.274" offset="15777499">I ask that the Seventh Circuit be reversed.</text>
