            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">The second case, US Parole Commission against Geraghty comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.628" offset="38452">Geraghty was a federal prisoner and he was twice denied parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.047" offset="60186">He brought a lawsuit in federal court challenging the validity of the United States Parole Commission's Parole Release Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.202" offset="92787">He purported to represent a class of all federal prisoners eligible for release.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.440" offset="113685">The trial court refused to certify the class and gave judgment for the defendants on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.435" offset="137718">Geraghty appealed and while that appeal was pending, he was released from prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.710" offset="162795">The Court of Appeals held that his did not render the case moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.223" offset="180872">It went on to hold that class certification would not be inappropriate and it therefore reversed the denial of class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.166" offset="216607">In an opinion filed today, we hold that a purported class action does not become moot upon the expiration of the named plaintiff's substantive claim even though class certification has been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.792" offset="275122">And this is because the representative of the purported class retains a personal stake in obtaining a class certification sufficient to assure the maintenance of the case or controversy standard required under Article III of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.982" offset="339905">We therefore approve the judgment of the Court of Appeals except for its ruling that the burden of constructing subclasses was on the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.275" offset="376999">It is our view that that burden is on the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.165" offset="392568">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion that has been filed with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.769" offset="431020">I'm authorized to say Mr. Justice Powell has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined therein by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Stewart, and Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
