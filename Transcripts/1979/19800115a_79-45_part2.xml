            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Griswold, you may resume.</text>

          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="16.888" stopTime="319.002">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="16.888" offset="170924">First, I would like to make a brief further answer to what in effect were two questions closely related from Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.918" offset="219094">This case does not involve a question of who makes a sale or what business is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.032" offset="247515">This case involves an aspect of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.716" offset="266219">The difference between Paine Webber and the appellee here is that the appellee is a bank, a bank holding company.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.967" offset="303208">And the whole history of this country for 200 years shows a constant struggle on the highest political level to maintain the position of the States with respect to the handling of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.150" offset="380008">And that's what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.698" offset="394115">This is -- both the Congress and the States have passed legislation in this area over many years, and the statutes which are involved here are statutes of that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.085" offset="451688">Now, I was referring to the particular provisions in the Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.928" offset="475094">The first one of which is that a bank holding company cannot own a bank in a State unless the State says it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.478" offset="513233">The second one is that no bank holding company may -- may own any company which is not a bank, and these things are not banks, this investment advisory and it's strange to say, the trust business is not a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.162" offset="576031">And then, there comes -- well, through these provisions, Congress has formulated a national policy in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.632" offset="637889">This case would never have arisen were it not for an exception to Section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act which is in 12 U.S.C. 1843 (c) (8) and is printed on page D2, Appendix D of the appellant's brief, and it says, “Hence, such prohibition shall not, with respect to any other bank holding company, apply to shares of any company the activities of which the Board,” that's the Federal Reserve Board, “after new notice, an opportunity for hearing has determined by order or regulation to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.”</text>
            <text syncTime="184.186" offset="840077">Now, the appellees contend that in substance by this exception, Congress has undone much of which -- what it so clearly did and intended to do in the basic parts of the very same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.617" offset="897860">I do not think that this exception needs to be construed or should be construed to authorize any such result to authorize in effect the introduction of a new cutting edge of expansion from outside the State when the whole tenure of the statute, in its history, shows that the basic policy choice made by Congress was to protect the States from expansion by outside bank holding companies except to the extent that the State chose to authorize such expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.647" offset="1037981">The basic policies established by Congress are clear, no bank outside the State, no subsidiary which is not a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.850" offset="1082807">This gives color to, and helps to define the scope of the exemption given in (c) (8).</text>
            <text syncTime="253.134" offset="1115930">To use the words used by the Court in another text, this basic -- another context, these basic prohibitory provisions provide emanations and a penumbra which helped to determine the intent of Congress which was expressed in (c) (8).</text>
            <text syncTime="275.761" offset="1206418">My suggestion is that (c) (8) can be given full scope and effect by construing it to have a territorial limitation, that (c) (8) authorizes the Board to authorize a bank holding company to own a corporation which is not a bank to provide services to the bank holding company in a State where the bank holding company is authorized to own a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.815" offset="1314670">But that it should not be construed in a wide open way to authorize the bank holding company to proceed in the other States -- all other States without a limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.459" offset="1797204">As Justice Cardozo said in the Panama Refining case, “The meaning of the statute is to be looked for not in any single section but in all the parts together and then their relation to the end in view.”</text>
            <text syncTime="436.767" offset="1850389">And I would call attention to the fact that in the recent case of (Inaudible) against Boyle involving jurisdiction of appeals from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.944" offset="1995107">I should point out initially that the statutory provision that Dean Griswold was just referring to, which is at D2 of the appendix of the red brief, contains no territorial limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.031" offset="2067519">It has never been construed by the Board to contain the limitation that Dean Griswold contends should be read into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.407" offset="2109001">Indeed, until a few minutes ago, I wasn't aware that that argument was being made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.084" offset="2135751">And if that construction is adopted by the Court with no basis whatsoever, it will result in invalidating literally hundreds of substantial acquisitions made by bank holding companies with the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, not disturbed by any judicial proceeding for many years.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.275" offset="2348492">It remits the parties to the Court for that purpose which is why this case was instituted in a three-judge District Court in Florida and brought up here as it has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.757" offset="2398438">So the Board's final action was, “We would have approved or we would likely have approved this application but for the recent one, hastily enacted Florida statute --</text>

            <text syncTime="599.860" offset="2502823">The Court noted in its opinion in Whitney that the Board had at that point, considered that Section 7 of the Bank Holding Company Act permitted States to preclude the doing of business by bank holding companies entirely to preclude that form of commercial organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.502" offset="2593416">We don't have to reach that question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.253" offset="2612433">Of course, since Florida permits the doing of business by bank holding companies, it permits that form of commercial organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.126" offset="2639914">But I don't believe there's any indication that the Board reads Section 7 as permitting an -- and otherwise unconstitutional discrimination against out-of-state firms.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.121" offset="2867806">And the fact that the business that Bankers Trust proposes to engage in would be conducted in interstate commerce was not disputed by Florida before the three-judge District Court and in fact was conceded.</text>
