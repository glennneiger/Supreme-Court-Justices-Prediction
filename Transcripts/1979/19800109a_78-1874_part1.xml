            <text syncTime="102.235" offset="512293">The commonwealth seeks review of an order of the Supreme Judicial Court requiring suppression of a confession of certain real evidence which was obtained pursuant to a search warrant based upon that confession and a subsequent and culpatory statement by the defendant to his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.256" offset="580420">The basic issue is whether the Fifth Amendment requires such suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.539" offset="597556">I shall limit discussion of the facts to those surrounding the confession since the legality of the arrest is not at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.139" offset="627963">The body of the victim was discovered in the early morning hours of June 11, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.564" offset="649592">After being informed by neighbors that they heard a scream and seen a young man, approximately five-foot-ten, wearing dungarees and with his shirtsleeves rolled up, leaving the scene, the police conducted general inquiries as to young men who were known to frequent that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.176" offset="716048">These inquiries took place at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.453" offset="725138">One young man said that he knew the victim and that he had seen her sitting on some church steps with a young man in his teens, with dark hair, who was at that time shirtless.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.552" offset="769546">Another young man came to the station, one John Carroll, who told the police that he knew the victim and that he had seen her on those church steps with Joseph Meehan.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.397" offset="808939">As he was telling the police this, he looked out the window and saw Joseph Meehan hitch-hiking on the street outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.151" offset="836002">He told the police this, they immediately exited the station, went to Mr. Meehan, told him of their general investigations and asked him to accompany them to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.979" offset="875290">He agreed after first noting that he was on his way to the unemployment office either to pick up his check or to appeal the denial of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.521" offset="909458">He accompanied the police to the station and a Detective Solari began asking him general questions when he noticed what appeared to him was blood on the defendant's sneakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.620" offset="953866">He mentioned this to the defendant who stated, no, it was mud, but that if it were blood in any event he had gotten the blood in a fight with one George Quish the previous Tuesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.857" offset="1006843">The detective asked Mr. Meehan for the sneaker and he gave it to the detective who left the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.106" offset="1031816">As it happened, Frank Quish was also being questioned at the station at this time and he denied having the fight with Joseph Meehan.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.270" offset="1060446">Another officer looked at the sneaker and he concluded that it was blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.854" offset="1074761">This was later confirmed by the police chemist that afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.561" offset="1089599">Detective Solari returned to the defendant, advised him of his rights under Miranda and advised him that he was under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.476" offset="1121259">At 11:20, Officer Kelley commenced an interrogation of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.695" offset="1146128">This interrogation was recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.434" offset="1157099">The interrogation began with the full recitation of the Miranda rights again, and the defendant responded that he understood them.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.944" offset="1183117">He did respond, "right," "yes," one word responses, and he agreed to speak about the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.781" offset="1214464">The defendant first denied he knew her and then agreed that he knew her generally, had seen her around town but that he had last seen her on the previous Tuesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.437" offset="1241109">This is a Friday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.253" offset="1248423">The officer mentioned the blood on his sneakers and the defendant respond that it had come from a fight on Tuesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.789" offset="1270575">The officer said it was too fresh to have gotten there on Tuesday and the defendant suggested the freshness was due to the fact that he was swimming the day before but that he had last seen her on Tuesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.245" offset="1312371">The officer then advised him that witnesses had seen them together last night.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.247" offset="1328358">He suggested that this was serious and said, "I think truth is the best thing at this time, the victim is dead and you are under arrest."</text>
            <text syncTime="313.796" offset="1358555">The defendant said, "Under arrest for what?"</text>
            <text syncTime="315.801" offset="1366601">And the officer said, "For the death, for the murder, and we have witnesses who saw you together."</text>
            <text syncTime="320.625" offset="1385827">The defendant then asked if he could see those witnesses and the officer declined to do that at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.416" offset="1412995">He then admitted that he had in fact been with the victim the previous night, that they had met in a bar, that they had two beers, that they discussed getting some pot or marihuana and that they left the bar around 11:30 or so and had proceeded to the church steps where they sat for fifteen or twenty minutes but then that he had left and the victim had gone in one direction and he had gone in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.136" offset="1507871">After some discussion about what the victim had been wearing at this time, the defendant blurted out, "I was whacked out last night."</text>
            <text syncTime="357.865" offset="1534830">He then talked about having taken pills, some 15 Valiums of 5 milligrams each, he specified the milligrams, and that they had been drinking beer, but he continued to deny that anything had happened between he and the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.482" offset="1585298">At this point there is a pause in the interrogation and another detective suggests that the defendant had asked him what bearing it would have if he told them what had happened, what degree it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.469" offset="1633259">The police responded that they had no control over that, and Sgt. Kelley responded, "I can't promise you anything, I have no jurisdiction over anything like that," that he would inform the District Attorney and the court and defense counsel of cooperation, but said, "I can't say you are going to get a break."</text>
            <text syncTime="398.768" offset="1698461">He continued, "All I can promise you is that I will make your cooperation known, but again I can't promise you anything."</text>
            <text syncTime="405.105" offset="1723747">He then continued, "If you wish to tell the truth of what happened, then I can say in all fairness it will probably help your defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.128" offset="1751855">Is there anything else you want to know?"</text>
            <text syncTime="413.942" offset="1759169">The defendant asked if he could go home and get some clothes and the officer said that he would get them, that the police would get them, and then referring to the drinking of the night before, asked the defendant if he were still high.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.582" offset="1805667">The defendant responded, "A little jiggy," but then said that he could understand what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.419" offset="1829073">The officer again said --</text>

            <text syncTime="432.875" offset="1834924">The defendant responded what?</text>
            <text syncTime="433.993" offset="1839313">I didn't hear you.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.538" offset="1861569">The officer again asked if he wanted to tell him what the story was and the defendant said, "Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.976" offset="1879228">But if I tell you, is it going to come out in court?"</text>
            <text syncTime="446.767" offset="1890408">The officer said it will anyway, we have a good case and my suggestion is that the truth is going to make a good defense in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.765" offset="1922382">The defendant responded, "I don't know."</text>
            <text syncTime="456.502" offset="1929383">The officer asked, "You don't know what?</text>
            <text syncTime="459.147" offset="1939937">Do you want to tell us about it?"</text>
            <text syncTime="461.324" offset="1948714">And then said, "Did you say she provoked you?</text>
            <text syncTime="464.604" offset="1961775">Is that my understanding?"</text>
            <text syncTime="466.308" offset="1968567">The defendant responded, "Yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="468.168" offset="1976090">And the officer advised him to tell the story in his own words and the defendant, stating that he had been high on Valium and drunk, stated he flipped out when she made fun of him and then proceeded to confess and describe the events surrounding the killing.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.436" offset="2413066">While this interrogation was in progress, Officer Solari who had received the sneaker from the defendant went to court in order to secure a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.584" offset="2445667">While he was there, he was advised by telephone of the confession and included the fact of the confession in the affidavit to support probable cause for the search warrant, admitting the reference to the bloody sneakers and the other identification of the defendant, a pair of blood-stained dungarees recovered from the defendant's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.334" offset="2520691">At approximately 4:00 p.m., the defendant's mother and brother arrived at the police station and were escorted to the defendant's cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.679" offset="2546082">As they approached he blurted out, "Ma, I didn't mean to hit her so hard."</text>
            <text syncTime="614.966" offset="2563218">The defendant filed a motion to suppress and in an affidavit stated his grounds, his prior ingestion of alcohol and drugs and that he did not know that he had a right or a need of a lawyer and he was frightened.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.995" offset="2611388">The Supreme Judicial Court held that the confession must be suppressed as involuntary and that the dungarees must be suppressed on the grounds that the confession was involuntary and therefore directly offensive to the Fifth Amendment, and that the afternoon statement must also be suppressed under the "cat out of the bag" theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.665" offset="2682023">The common law submits that the lower court has misconstrued what is constitutionally permissible police interrogation and it has based its decision on a misconstruction of the scope and applicability of the Fifth Amendment privilege to the context of police interrogation.</text>
