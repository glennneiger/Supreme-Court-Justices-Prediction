            <text syncTime="65.942" offset="367156">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.948" offset="383143">Three years ago when Greer v. Spock this Court upheld an Army regulation that required the approval of the base commander before written materials could be distributed on base.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.272" offset="428492">The court held that the regulation was facially valid and valid as applied to the distribution of political leaflets by civilians on base.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.960" offset="467257">In this case the Ninth Circuit has held that essentially identical Air Force regulations are invalid when applied to the distribution of petitions by servicemen upon base.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.386" offset="516890">The case arose in 1974 when respondent was on active duty in the Air Force Reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.476" offset="541236">He prepared petitions addressed to members of Congress and to the Secretary of Defense opposing military hair length standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.862" offset="574777">He was informed by a military attorney at Travis Air Force Base in California where he was stationed that on base distribution of petitions required prior approval but the off base distribution did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.131" offset="627858">Respondent decided simply to distribute the petitions off base in locations near the base.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.878" offset="654921">But one week later he took a training plane to Guam and while he was at the base in Guam he distributed copies of his petitions to personnel at the Guam Air Force Base without seeking command approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.894" offset="706957">Because of this violation of the regulation he was transferred by the Air Force from active to inactive reserve status.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.968" offset="739244">Respondent then brought this suit and the courts below declared the Air Force regulations to be invalid and ordered Respondent's reinstatement to active duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.148" offset="779995">The Court of Appeals held that the regulations are unconstitutional as applied to the distribution of petitions in general and are also invalid under 10 U.S.C. 1034 as applied to petitions to members of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.900" offset="838928">We seek reversal of these two rulings and I will address the constitutional issue first.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.613" offset="885844">The District Court in this case entered declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.786" offset="902562">We haven't sought a stay of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.643" offset="909981">They also ordered reinstatement but that judgment presumably is held in abeyance pending the review in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.093" offset="1719777">And is the reason there is no question about it that it is not prohibited by the regulation or that it is protected by the Constitution or the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="411.351" offset="1748825">Which is your reason?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="412.262" stopTime="743.974">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="412.262" offset="1752377">Well, I think the reasons come very close together and I think that that will be more evident as I get into my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.292" offset="1788531">The regulations in this case concern only the public solicitation of signatures and the distribution of petitions on military bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.640" offset="1821968">Under these regulations any servicemen they privately solicit and may distribute petitions off base as Respondent Glines did in this case without seeking or requiring or needing command approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.438" offset="1873168">But when solicitation or distribution occurs on base the approval of the base commander must be sought and here as in Greer v. Spock the commander must approve on base distribution unless it would clearly endanger military discipline, loyalty or morale or materially interfere with a military mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.843" offset="1950699">Now, we submit that the regulations challenged in this case are constitutional for the same reasons stated by the Court in Greer v. Spock.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.916" offset="1987062">The Court held in Greer that military bases such as the Guam Air Base and Travis Air Base are not public forums, that is unlike parks and city streets, military bases should not traditionally serve as places for public assembly and expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.763" offset="2050382">Their traditional function, as the Court stated in Greer is to train soldiers to fight or to be prepared to fight and not to provide a forum for public speech activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.166" offset="2092074">Because of this, as the Court held in Greer, there is no historical or constitutional basis for right of access or use of military bases for public speech purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.922" offset="2139094">And military regulations that conditionally authorize public solicitation and distribution of petitions on bases thus do not entrench upon, abridge or deny any preexisting constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.638" offset="2193951">To the contrary, they establish a conditional regulatory right that previously did not exist and it is because of this that the Court rejected in Greer without comment the claim that the regulations are an over-broad or a prior restraint on speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.005" offset="2259362">The regulation's don't interfere with preexisting right.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.595" offset="2277752">As the Court indicated in the Lehman case, when a non-public forum is opened on a conditional basis for public speech, it is the equal protection clause that determines whether the conditions of access or use are constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.770" offset="2338461">And here as in Lehman, it isn't arbitrary, capricious or invidious for the military to choose to authorize on base petitioning activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.169" offset="2376077">Only when they do not clearly endanger military loyalty, discipline and morale and will not materially interfere with assigned military missions.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.188" offset="2416097">The limitation, to use the Court's language in the Police Department v. Mosley is tailed to serve a substantial Government interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.914" offset="2450996">It focuses precisely on the abuse to be controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.839" offset="2470745">The Court of Appeals reasoned that this case was distinct from Greer because this case involves servicemen who want to exercise speech rights on military bases, while Greer concerns civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.502" offset="2533334">But for servicemen, as for civilians, military bases have not served traditionally as forums for public expression and certainly not as forums for the distribution of leaflets and petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.670" offset="2586102">These and other forms of on base public expressive activities such as demonstrations and picketing have always been subject to command approval and indeed are subject to similar regulatory restrictions as those involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.928" offset="2647124">The fact that servicemen rather than civilians are involved in this case supports the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.663" offset="2673977">The military's authority over the speech and conduct of servicemen is necessarily far broader than its authority over similar conduct by civilians on military bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.166" offset="2724028">For one thing, servicemen are Government employees and this Court has held that the Government may reasonably limit speech and various forms of political activity by its employees when necessary to achieve effective government.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.582" offset="2785677">And, in particular, in the context of soldiers the Court has held in Parker v. Levy that military may properly prohibit speech by servicemen that undermines discipline and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.489" offset="2841370">It would be incongruous to conclude that servicemen have a greater right of public expression on military bases than do civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.079" offset="2875643">The Court was of course aware in Greer v. Spock that servicemen were subject to the Army regulation as well as civilians and there is no basis for distinguishing this case from Greer on the ground that servicemen as well as civilians are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.483" offset="2949308">Well, even if we are wrong about that and even if Greer is wrong, that military bases should be or are open to public speech activities, the challenge regulations would not be unconstitutional even under the principles applicable to public forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.900" offset="3019003">The substantive goal advanced by the regulations is undeniably of great importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.513" offset="3041468">The prohibition of on base distributions that clearly endanger effective military performance is obviously related to a fundamental --</text>

            <text syncTime="1325.545" offset="5405550">Indeed, in Carlson v. Schlesinger, decided three years before by the District of Columbia Circuit, the court construed the statute to apply only to individual correspondence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1451.248" offset="5908355">The regulation encompasses only what the statute doesn't public activities, distribution of petitions on base rather than the communication of the petition, the private communication, to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.166" offset="5964048">When Congress is legislated with respect to group petitioning activity in other contexts, it is done so expressly. 5 U.S.C. 7102 was enacted 40 years before this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.328" offset="6020681">And it provides that the right of civil service employees, and I quote individually or collectively to petition Congress may not be interfered with or denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1496.577" offset="6089644">But in 10 U.S.C. 1034, the language is limited to individual communications because the evil the Congress had before it was interference with the privacy of those communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.199" offset="6140217">Assuming that the statute applies to group petitioning, the challenge regulations are nonetheless valid because they don't restrict the communication of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.759" offset="6182431">The kind of restriction that Congress was it enacted the statute was on the communication itself on the requirement that the Navy then had that private letters be sent through the chain of command.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.241" offset="6232377">Well, the regulations don't restrict communications in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.954" offset="6247215">Any letter or petition may be sent to Congress wholly without military review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.767" offset="6270412">What the regulations restrict is the use of military bases, ships and aircraft as forms for solicitation and distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.665" offset="6310013">It is the military's unwillingness to provide a forum for this conduct in limited circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.361" offset="6336867">A restriction on the communication of the petition to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.973" offset="6351287">It is only if the statute intended to impose affirmative obligations on the services to open military facilities to conduct traditionally prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.788" offset="6394546">Certainly nothing in the statute or in its legislative history indicates that this is what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.514" offset="6425475">We agree with Judge Tamm in his dissent in the Huff case that it is inconceivable that Congress in 1951 in the middle of the Korean War intended to create a public forum right for group petitioning activities on military bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.202" offset="6484198">Group action as in the distribution of petitions on military facilities is not mentioned even briefly in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.514" offset="6521396">And because the regulations don't restrict communications within the meaning of the statute they are not invalid under 10 U.S.C. 1034.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.827" offset="6554728">There are additional points to be made on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.337" offset="6568730">The next case to be argued also raises the statutory issue.</text>
