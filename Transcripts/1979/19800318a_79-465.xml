            <text syncTime="80.904" offset="427029">Bernus Fischman of Houston, Texas for the petitioner, Navarro Savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.832" offset="442702">Your Honors, certiorari was granted in this case to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which held that the citizenship of a Massachusetts business trust, in this case, a real estate investment trust, was that of each of its trustees as opposed to its some 9500 beneficial shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.116" offset="543848">The petitioner believes that the case although one of first impression on the narrow point now before this Court, that is as to a real estate investment trust as a particular species of business organization, although it is a case of first impression that it is well governed by previous decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.243" offset="648338">The -- the principal decision or pair of decisions which believe are governing in this case are Morrissey versus Commissioner, cited in the brief, and that of United Steelworkers versus R.H. Bouligny and company.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.391" offset="712913">The Bouligny case – well, let me do it first with Morrissey.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.426" offset="725034">Morrissey holds that a real estate investment trust is an association as opposed to some other species of entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.594" offset="769755">It says in effect in the – the holding of the case is that it would be taxed as an association under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.840" offset="822732">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.502" offset="825344">The -- the Morrissey case is addressed particularly to the statutory construction of the Internal Revenue Act, but I think a careful reading of a case and we say this in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.550" offset="881560">The case does not confine itself to application on the narrow issue of what is this entity for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.610" offset="921788">What it does say is this entity is a business trust and we will treat as such incidentally for tax purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.439" offset="957106">My -- my question was not so much that the Morrissey case may not have relied on the Internal Revenue Code, but that perhaps, it may have been wrong in relying on the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.695" offset="1014157">Since we do have a diversity jurisdiction and for fairly, carefully defined statute setting out what shall be this test and for jurisdiction of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.740" offset="1062327">Why go to the Internal Revenue clauses?</text>

            <text syncTime="241.943" offset="1071104">I don't believe we're looking to the Internal Revenue Code, Your Honor, to determine where the jurisdiction lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.508" offset="1097435">As we say in the brief, it's really a two – a two-point analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.750" offset="1114363">All Morrissey says is, “This entity is a business association.”</text>
            <text syncTime="257.596" offset="1133798">We're not going to treat it as a conventional trust, because it has the features of continuity or perhaps perpetual life.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.042" offset="1171519">It has the features of transferability of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.075" offset="1183640">It's an active, ongoing business organization that has the object of making money and distributing the gains to the -- the beneficial interest holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.796" offset="1226585">It's not a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.240" offset="1232332">That's all that we say Morrissey holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.447" offset="1245184">To find out where the jurisdiction lies, one must then look to the Bouligny case, which is in itself only the natural outcropping of it's antecedents, the prior decision of this Court in Chapman versus Barney in 1887 I believe, decision of this Court, in which it was held as a matter noticed by the Court as opposed to anything that was suggested by either of the parties in their -- in their briefs that -- that the District Court or excuse me, the Circuit Court at that time did not have jurisdiction because the -- the entity there was – it's called an express company.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.463" offset="1401187">It was in essence, of joint-stock association and therefore, as it has been characterized, a -- a mere partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.313" offset="1432639">And the Court said, “We must look to the citizenship of each of the constituent members of this entity that have aggregated themselves for the purposes of conducting business.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="346.407" offset="1488959">But you're talking about the 1887 case now?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="350.051" offset="1503587">Do you think the changes in modes of doing business in that time with this was anything to do with how would this case should be viewed?</text>

          <turn speaker="bernus_wm_fischman" startTime="361.686" stopTime="465.802">
            <label>Mr. Bernus Wm. Fischman</label>
            <text syncTime="361.686" offset="1550085">None whatever, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.842" offset="1562728">We believe that the basic principle is one that is -- adheres from the earliest concepts of our federal – our -- our system of federalism which is, at ordinarily, this cases belong in the state courts and this was pointed out in the Carlsberg decision we've -- we cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.978" offset="1639320">That there is a – this federalism concept that says these cases belong in the state courts, unless there is a good reason they belong in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.114" offset="1671816">If you go back to the -- the problems that this Court -- in the antecedents that this Court had in -- in wrenching with the decision of what to do with corporations, they were artificial persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.776" offset="1726464">They had no citizenship of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.678" offset="1738062">So originally, in Bank versus Deveaux, the Court said, “We're going -- we're not going to treat them as -- as an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.687" offset="1774111">We're going look to the citizenship.”</text>
            <text syncTime="419.267" offset="1780485">The Court then reversed itself in the next case.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.985" offset="1791352">And then finally, in the Marshall versus Baltimore &amp; Ohio case, the Court said, “All right, we're going to treat this entity as being comprised of its individual shareholders, its beneficial interest holders, but we're going to indulge in the fiction that all of these people reside in the State of incorporation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="444.973" offset="1883303">Now, this persisted until the 1958 Amendments to the judicial code which said, “We're now going to codify that fiction,” but there has been no other effort on the part of Congress to recognize real estate investment trust, limited partnership, joint-stock associations or other forms of unincorporated associations.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="465.802" offset="1966582">But point you've just said suggested – suggest at least to me, that over the last century the -- the varying modes of business and practices have been reflected in decisions of the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.583" offset="2037739">But, if we look to the Bouligny case, we find that a labor union is certainly a type of entity that I don't believe existed in any great quantity during the -- the early part of the development of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.549" offset="2101582">The labor unions became strong, really as entities at the beginning of this century.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.848" offset="2122794">In the Bouligny case this Court said – speaking to Mr. Justice Fortas that we will not extend this rule to comprehend the labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.961" offset="2167202">We will not indulge in the same fiction for the labor union that we have indulged in a corporation and the Court could conveniently say that I think, because at that time the corporation had been treated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.035" offset="2223522">And this is why the opinion says that please, for extension of the diversity jurisdiction should be addressed to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.467" offset="2253197">And I think that's what the -- what the respondents have argued here in – a part of their brief, we finally get down to it and they say, “This is what the rule ought to be.”</text>
            <text syncTime="545.726" offset="2286320">This Court should create a fictional citizenship for this one particular type of entity, a Massachusetts business trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="687.271" offset="2852446">Rule 17, if it does, do that and perhaps it conflicts with Rule 82 under the construction that the respondents have argued for, Rule 17 would become in effect, a jurisdictional rule as opposed to one that merely determines the capacity of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.980" offset="2927261">And I think that's what Rule 17 was directed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.522" offset="2941471">The –- the -- it seems that the respondents have sort of put the cart before the horse.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.582" offset="3941752">Several of these cases that are cited, I think are distinguishable on the fact that all of the parties did in fact have diverse citizenship, even including the beneficial interest holders and including the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.338" offset="3992743">That's the case of the Dodge versus Tulleys and Bullard versus City of Cisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.904" offset="4030986">In those cases, which are relied upon by the trustees in this case, you already had diversity anyway, and I don't think that the -- the points made in those cases are necessary for the decision that was ultimately made.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.746" offset="4082395">In the Wyoming and Susquehanna case Blatchford, the -- the Court held there was no jurisdiction, because the trustee in the case did have the same citizenship as one of the defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.795" offset="4142582">So I don't know how much those cases furnish a -- a dichotomy between the line of cases of Bouligny, Chapman versus Barney, Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel, which was a case that involved a limited partnership which was decided by this Court and is nearly as I can see, squarely conflicts with the Second Circuit case which this Court denied sort on, but certainly did not hear and -- and affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1056.035" offset="4327528">First, I must disagree with my learned colleague as to the essence of the holding of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.922" offset="4355009">It is my reading of the decision by the Fifth Circuit that the individual plaintiffs who alleged that they were trustees of a business trust were the real parties and interest and that it was their citizenship that governed the question of the diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1087.452" offset="4453230">That's correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.010" offset="4459395">Like Mr. Morrissey, in the Morrissey case the plaintiffs in this case were trustees of an expressed trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.683" offset="4494085">The long ran of decisions that are cited in the briefs by both sides, hold two basic premisses that I think are essential to the analysis of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.026" offset="4539434">Those cited by Mr. Fischman on behalf of his clients including Chapman versus Barney, and Marshall versus Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad and the Bouligny case, all stand for this proposition that in unincorporated group of individuals that by state law or otherwise have the right to sue in a joint name are -- that joint name is nevertheless not a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.758" offset="4646431">Citizenship is a status that is attributed only to flesh and blood individuals and when there's a suit in a joint name, it becomes incumbent upon the Court to determine who really are the flesh and blood individuals that are suing in that name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.966" offset="4715186">The cases which we cited I think hold to the proposition that when a suit is brought in the name of a trustee for the benefit of a beneficiary, really and truly, then it is the citizenship of the plaintiff, the trustee and not the citizenship of the beneficiary that governs the question of diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.760" offset="4814451">Only when it is a non personal suit, that is a suit by an entity or in the joint name of several individuals do we have to question that counsel poses and that is trying to determine the citizenship of that name or that entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.554" offset="4901595">To analyze this case, we think it's important that the Court consider the basic purpose of the diversity jurisdiction, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall early in this Court's history, commented that the draft of -- of the Constitution either had apprehension as to the impartiality of the state courts or at least viewed with indulgence, the possible fears and apprehensions in that regard, that suitors might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.896" offset="5014967">The purpose of the diversity jurisdiction is to provide a device to give some protection against local prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.935" offset="5055091">Another kind of prejudice that is -- prejudice is a subject that this Court deals within many ways -- of course, this is not prejudice based on race, religion, or sex, but it is prejudice against United States citizens based upon their domicile, their citizenship in a State other than the State of the opposing party, the State before.</text>

            <text syncTime="1869.142" offset="7579982">Who are the real plaintiffs?</text>

            <text syncTime="1894.703" offset="7682173">If on the other hand, it is a name that sues Fidelity Mortgage Investors in this case, the court must determine who it is that is behind that name.</text>

            <text syncTime="1909.018" offset="7739434">In that regard, we think that it would be proper to look to the state law and to the documents establishing that trust or limited partnership to determine who has the right to sue as between the beneficiaries and the trustee on the one hand, who can be sued, who has limited liability, who has unlimited liability, who has the right to transact business from which the controversy arose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.787" offset="7854477">And by looking at those principles, it can be determined that in this case, the real people who sued even if it was FMI, the Fidelity Mortgage Investors who brought the suit, was the trustees not the beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.385" offset="7924903">The Marshall decision cited by the defendants in the court below, in fact seemed to imply or at least it can be read to imply that even with regard to a corporation, it is the directors and officers whose citizenship governs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.909" offset="7995016">I'll be the first to admit that the language in that decision is not clear when the -- this Court created a conclusive presumption that a corporation has its citizenship for diversity purposes in the State of its incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.875" offset="8054888">It was not clear whether the Court was presuming citizenship of the directors and officers on the one hand or whether it was presuming the citizenship of the shareholders on the other, I believe it can be read either way, but if it is read in the former, that is entirely consistent with -- with all of the analysis that we're suggesting to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2449.442" offset="9901119">Only in the sense that the labor union is not organized in the ultimate sense for a financial profit, but it does have as its goal, the distribution of benefits to its membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.086" offset="9951692">It is ongoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.338" offset="9956707">It has business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.501" offset="9961409">It has officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.470" offset="9965275">It has members who control ultimately the decisions of its managers, its presidents, its stewards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.408" offset="9997040">So in that sense, there really is no real difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.789" offset="10018565">I think if the Court here extends diversity jurisdiction in effect and expands it to accommodate the Massachusetts business trust, you create an infinite possibility for deceptive practices if you will, to create jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.041" offset="10095574">I think that is as clearly an issue which the Court will have to confront.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.621" offset="10113860">And I would point out to the Court that this -- that this particular lawsuit was not originally commenced in the Federal District Court in the Northern District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.923" offset="10151058">It was commenced in the State District Court in Dallas, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.610" offset="10165791">And only when a plea of privilege was sustained to transferring this case to the county in which Navarro has its headquarters, was the suit dropped and refiled in the Northern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.253" offset="10212394">So, some of the argument that there is the local prejudice doesn't completely reign through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.767" offset="10234441">It was the particular forum within the State of Texas that the -- that the respondents were seeking to -- to invoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.331" offset="10280730">Now, this Court must consider the Marshall versus Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad case, where it was simply stated that in creating this fiction, we're not going to disregard the fact that the corporators and those were in fact the people who were referred to in that opinion, I -- I can understand counsel's confusion with that term with the corporators as used in that -- that somewhat quaint or antiquated language, simply means the shareholders of the corporation where the ones whose residents would be looked to, to determine citizenship for diversity purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.648" offset="10429942">I would respectfully submit to the Court that you must in order to hold there is diversity jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.245" offset="10456377">You must overrule Marshall versus Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.190" offset="10476126">You must implicitly overrule Bouligny and the cases which are in its antecedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.359" offset="10496815">And I think you will do so with all the attendant risk that you will increase the -- the litigation which will be filed in federal forms as a direct result of that -- of that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.843" offset="10558777">I would also respectfully point out to the Court that the -- in this particular case, for example, it and -- of course it doesn't appear particularly from the record one way or the other, whether all of the trustees of the Massachusetts business trust are before the Court, but it should be pointed out that there is no requirement under the argument which respondents advanced that all of the trustees be before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.139" offset="10659924">Supposing, for example, they had several trustees who were residents of the State of Texas, it would be rather convenient to simply ignore their existence and bring the -- the action in the name of only those trustees who were non-Texas residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.982" offset="10723349">And there is nothing in what the respondents argue that would make that in effect, a collusive joinder to confer jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.306" offset="10748635">It's simply an omission to bring forward those parties who would in effect, destroy the diversity jurisdiction of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.477" offset="10793253">The -- the trust cases, the express trust cases Dodge versus Tulleys, first, as we pointed out, we believe, we respectfully submit, are distinguishable, an express trust in the sense of a mortgage indenture or in the case of Dodge versus Tulleys or -- excuse me, Bullard versus City of Cisco, you had a bondholders committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.429" offset="10889070">But that bondholders committee was organized for one limited purpose and also, all of the shareholders, a close reading of the case, says that the persons who elected to join with the bondholders committee, number one, had citizenship diverse from all of the -- the defendants, that was the first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.544" offset="10969527">Moreover, all of those bondholders who contributed their bonds to the committee --</text>
