            <label>Mr. Melvyn Carson Bruder</label>
            <text syncTime="49.794" offset="302582">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.424" offset="317106">We are dealing in this case with the right of a state to exclude prospective jurors from a capital case solely because of their attitudes or feelings about the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.628" offset="381889">By statute, that is section 1231(b) of the Texas Penal Code, Texas in our opinion has impermissibly broadened the base of exclusion beyond the parameters established by the Witherspoon doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.952" offset="451166">And to the extent that Witherspoon does not allow the exclusion of any juror because of personal feelings about the death penalty, unless there is unmistakable irrevocable commission on the part of the prospective juror to vote against death, 1231(b) impedes upon Witherspoon to the extent that it allows the exclusion of the juror for a reason less than that described in Witherspoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.323" offset="584704">As proof of our position, we submit that any time a juror is qualified under Witherspoon and says I can in a proper case and under the right circumstances vote death, whenever such a juror is excluded under state law solely because of the juror's feelings about capital punishment, the juror is excluded on a broader basis than provided in Witherspoon.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="147.521" stopTime="165.844">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="147.521" offset="693478">You are suggesting that there is a gray zone of some kind here where a juror, a prospective juror might be influenced by the fact that the death penalty was involved or, on the other hand, might not be?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="melvyn_carson_bruder" startTime="165.844" stopTime="179.027">
            <label>Mr. Melvyn Carson Bruder</label>
            <text syncTime="165.844" offset="766725">I'm suggesting that as long as the juror is willing to state "I can vote death in the right case," that juror is qualified vis-a-vis his feelings about the death penalty.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="179.027" stopTime="189.765">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="179.027" offset="819493">By the right case, taking that phrase, does that mean the right case as he sees it or the right case as within the framework of the instructions of the court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="melvyn_carson_bruder" startTime="189.765" stopTime="360.051">
            <label>Mr. Melvyn Carson Bruder</label>
            <text syncTime="189.765" offset="862438">It means the right case under the evidence within the framework of the instructions given by the court and as he views the facts, because he is a personal representative of the community and it is he who must express the community conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.902" offset="922937">And under the guarded jury discretions, that is specifically provided for under the Texas capital punishment scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.661" offset="958046">The jury has the discretion to utilize what evidence and facts is made available, and by answering the three questions, knowing what the effect of those answers explicitly is, the jury exercises that community conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.357" offset="1036831">Thus, Witherspoon requires that that base defined in Witherspoon apply to jury selection in the state of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.264" offset="1080404">Now, the state has constructed a theoretical model upon which it hopes to convince this Court that 1231(b) stands for a proposition that even the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has disowned.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.195" offset="1140172">The state argues and agrees with us that Witherspoon does apply in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.958" offset="1159189">I take that to dispose of question number one under the grant of cert.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.380" offset="1180923">So we go to the next question, and the state argues that Witherspoon is not violated in this case and theoretically in any other case in Texas because the real purpose of 1231(b) is to exclude those jurors who are affected to the extent that they will allow their personal feelings to influence their vote, and that is not what 1231(b) says and that is not what the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has construed 1231(b) to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.735" offset="1334314">In fact, the Court of Criminal Appeals has said just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.935" offset="1351137">A juror who states under oath "I will answer the questions honestly, I will answer the three punishment questions truthfully, I will put aside whatever reservations I may have about capital punishment when I answer those three questions," that does not rehabilitate a prospective juror who has already said "I will be affected by the existence of the death penalty in this case."</text>
            <text syncTime="339.532" offset="1461478">So clearly the Court of Criminal Appeals has rejected what this Court suggested could exist in Lockett v. Ohio, that is that it is fair to excuse from jury service any prospective juror who says "I can't follow the law," and Witherspoon pretty much said the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.456" offset="1725210">Juror White said, "I think I believe in capital punishment, but I don't want to have anything to do with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.237" offset="1904306">It is still equivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.660" offset="1917994">And the important thing is that, on the one hand, the state says in its brief we really don't have to concern ourselves about the ultimate issue because the juror writes yes answers or no answers and it is the judge who sets the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.750" offset="1982360">And at the same time Juror White says -- "Could you set aside your feelings and vote for the death penalty, either directly or indirectly?"</text>
            <text syncTime="478.085" offset="2015692">"I guess I could.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.367" offset="2036799">You have to vote the question, the answers to the questions honestly, irregardless of what you think the penalty should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.353" offset="2060831">Do you think you can do that?"</text>

            <text syncTime="495.568" offset="2085595">So under state theory number one, Juror White is eminently qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.057" offset="2103568">But under state theory number two, which is inconsistent with number one, Juror White is not qualified and it is difficult from an analysis of their positions to determine which theory it is that they want this Court to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.368" offset="2244838">That is correct, the juror said.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.005" offset="2391437">I think a fair reading of the appendix and a fair reading of the voir dire examination in this case clearly indicates that what happens is that a prosecutor defines it for the juror before asking him the critical question called for by 1231(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.089" offset="5959764">Now, he has correctly characterized what Mr. Justice Blackmun has called a quirk of Texas law, that we would not be able simply to resentence him as far as I know under our procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.994" offset="6007306">He would be entitled to an entirely new trial on guilt or innocence under Texas law unless the Governor were to act in the manner that he describes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.426" offset="6045027">Now, I want, to make perfectly clear what the holding that the state of Texas is asking the Court to make today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.126" offset="6075852">It is in essence exactly what the Court of Criminal Appeals has come out with in the matter and that is that we have side by side Witherspoon and section 1231(b) of our penal code, and that jurors who are excluded upon either basis consistently and accurately that that would comply with the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1518.784" offset="6178461">The problem with your statement is that Witherspoon said that jurors could not be excluded for cause unless they unmistakably make clear that their disbelief in capital punishment would prevent them in all cases from imposing it, not could be excluded on either basis, that they could not be excluded constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.053" offset="6287548">That is what Witherspoon held.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.564" offset="6297579">Your Honor, section 1231(b) is not aimed at all at excluding jurors solely because they are against the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.102" offset="6335822">It is neutral upon that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.614" offset="6341778">It is aimed as much at excluding jurors who are in favor of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.948" offset="6359124">It is entirely neutral with respect to that particular attitude about the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.811" offset="6374588">What is it not neutral about is jurors who can be biased in either direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.774" offset="6394441">Now, before counsel for petitioner made a statement that if a jurors says that he is not unalterably opposed to the death penalty, that he should be qualified to sit, period, under Witherspoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.392" offset="6460897">Although that may be true and was highly applicable to the pre-Furman type statutes that gave juries basically unbridled discretion in the imposition of the death penalty, it shouldn't be true any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.624" offset="6505827">Such a juror might well be an extremely poor juror for the defendant or for the state under Texas law because he no longer has unbridled discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.148" offset="6543966">The fact questions that they had in Lockett are now in Texas at the punishment stage of trial, and really I don't think it makes any difference at all what the jurors' feelings are about the death penalty, either pro or con, under the Texas statutes and Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.769" offset="6602480">And certainly the prosecutor and the judge in this case seem to be of the opinion that it made very little difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.755" offset="6630379">In other words, the common pattern in the voir dire was to ask the juror what his attitudes were about the death penalty, and if the juror said, well, I am unalterably opposed to the death penalty and I could never vote to impose it, typically in almost every instance there was no objection upon Witherspoon grounds or that the juror was disqualified for service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.131" offset="6715852">In one case where there was an objection that he was disqualified, the court said, well, tell him about our statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.380" offset="6740929">The prosecutor would then go on to explain, well, even though you could never vote for the death penalty, and I respect that belief, let me explain the Texas scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.606" offset="6777814">There are two distinctive features of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.348" offset="6784815">In the first place, we have fact questions at the guilt or innocence stage of trial, and you will never actually have to write life or death on a piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.852" offset="6822745">You will never have to raise your hand and vote that the defendant lives or the defendant dies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.440" offset="6841135">Instead, you deliberate the questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.210" offset="6852211">Now, even though your feelings are very strong against the death penalty, could you fairly deliberate the questions of fact knowing that you never have to vote for death or for life actually directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.916" offset="6907068">Some jurors said, well, yes, I could do that, and what the state submits is that those jurors are qualified to sit on a Texas jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.339" offset="6940714">Under Witherspoon, the doctrine of Witherspoon, they might have been excluded from jury service, and yet 1231(b) saves them for jury service and we don't think that we need submit statistical studies to show that many of those jurors will be favorably disposed toward the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.023" offset="9515447">The prosecutor went on to ask him the statutory questions, which is the way that all jurors are handled in this voir dire and he also agreed that he could not -- he had to say that "I believe I couldn't answer them all yes if it would send him to his death."</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.544" offset="9573543">That is page 49-59.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.662" offset="9582007">At that point, Mrs. James, the defense counsel took over and she rehabilitated him upon the basis of section 1231(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.335" offset="9624743">She explained to him Texas law in more detail, explained to him and asked him to go over his feelings and the next twenty pages are a fascinating study for us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.607" offset="9713768">But as he went through it and as she took him, at page 49-69 and 49-70, it is like a light dawning in his mind when she asks him -- she explains the procedure and says, "I do not, no matter what, I don't believe in the death penalty at all, that is what I want you to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.736" offset="9782314">Question by Mrs. James "You would completely ignore the facts and automatically answer the questions no, regardless of the facts in any case? "</text>

            <text syncTime="2428.673" offset="9818049">She says, "Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.615" offset="9821811">Then would there be a feeling in your mind that you would keep an open mind and you could take affirmative action in answering those questions if you ever get them which might result or would result in the imposition of the death penalty in the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.289" offset="9868518">In other words, could you answer the questions as questions honestly?"</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.822" offset="9898611">And he was rehabilitated and the judge stated that he was qualified to be on the Texas jury, in spite of the fact that he could have been excluded under Witherspoon earlier, and defense counsel rehabilitated him using that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2866.069" offset="11567626">In three of those five cases where cert is pending, where the records were requested in January, the defendants, the petitioners are raising the questions not as petitioner here is but that -- now, as I read their petitions -- but that jurors were excluded from their trials because of unalterable opposition to the death penalty, and the 1231(b) inquiry was not met and the petitioner is complaining because 1231(b) was not invoked, and in my opinion they have a stronger case than petitioner here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.790" offset="11702523">But it rests for another day, and the case that we have we feel got him the best jury that was possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.279" offset="11732511">Now, the only basis -- I have explained that in my opinion 1231(b) is going to create the fairer jury for the defendant than Witherspoon would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.218" offset="11772217">Why then would not petitioners in those three cases I described now pending before the Court be entitled to relief?</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.084" offset="11803669">And the only answer I can give to that is that even though the jury examinations in their cases were not as good as petitioners Adams had, the Constitutions even in death penalty cases does not require perfection and that Witherspoon exclusion, which has been upheld by this Court is a sufficiently fair method of qualification of jurors that those convictions too would survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.709" offset="11962180">One other question that I would attempt to give some guidance to the Court upon is what affect upon the statutes of the other states a holding in our favor in the manner we've advocated today would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.273" offset="12012440">There are 38 states by my count that now have a death penalty statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.257" offset="12028426">Five of those have judge sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.367" offset="12036890">So 33 still have death penalty sentencing by jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.858" offset="12050787">The common pattern, as the Court well knows, is a set of aggravating and mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.140" offset="12071894">As far as I know, no state has affirmatively experienced the Texas method of not having jurors actually vote on life or death but merely answering the questions with known automatic results.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.743" offset="12130304">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.715" offset="12134275">Now, the statute of Washington state appears to allow for that but there are no cases upon it yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.802" offset="12158621">It is a new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.784" offset="12162487">And there are other statutes that are ambiguous, but I have not read -- I do not read their case law as saying that it -- it is certainly not as clear as in Texas as far as I can tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.768" offset="12202402">But the statutes of all 33 of those states would be quite amenable to the kind of 1231(b) qualification and rejection of a Witherspoon type qualification if they so desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.535" offset="12253497">It might have that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.682" offset="12258095">As I say, if we have made the jump from Furman to Jurek, from the unbridles discretion statute to the guided discretion statute, it seems to me that the interest of justice and the interest of the defendant will best be served by having jurors who can swear that they are going to be fair on the questions of fact, that they will be fair in deliberating on the questions of fact, regardless of their feelings on the death penalty, and that that will lead to a jury more expressive of the community conscience than the jury the petitioner contends he ought to have had at his trial.Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3085.619" offset="12445863">It seems a shame to me somehow that if both Witherspoon and 1231(b) parallel each other, and the states contends 1231(b) is fairer and the defendant contends that Witherspoon is fairer, that we can't provide for an election prior to trial and let the chips fall where they may based on that election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.635" offset="12533948">I think it is fair to say that this petitioner does not agree with the state that 1231(b) is in any sense of the word fair.</text>

            <text syncTime="3142.126" offset="12671875">Yet, in Hovila I, 532 S.W. 2d 294, former Presiding Judge Morrison said that the court will presume that a juror's answers will be affected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.067" offset="13443636">Judge Clinton said, "Witherspoon is no longer a viable measure of qualifying jurors in the bifurcated proceedings of the capital case in that they do not directly assess punishment and that a good deal more manifestation than merely acknowledging the magic phrase of 1231(b) should be required for disqualification.</text>
