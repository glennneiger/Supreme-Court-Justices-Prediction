            <text syncTime="16.524" offset="66038">The Internal Revenue Service has been conducting investigation of his income tax liabilities for the years 1973 to 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.096" offset="108356">The investigating agent attempted to determine whether a number of bank accounts were being maintained by him under different aliases.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.510" offset="142002">To assist in this determination, the Service issues summons requesting him to appear and execute samples of this handwriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.295" offset="181081">When he refused to provide the samples, the Service brought an action Federal District Court seeking enforcement of the sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.195" offset="212741">The District Court ordered that the summon should be enforced, but the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed that order, concluding that Congress had not authorized the Internal Revenue Service issue as summons for the purpose of obtaining handwriting samples.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.534" offset="278047">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we now reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.306" offset="297169">We find that the Internal Revenue Service Code does have statutory authority and confers it on the service under 26 U.S.C. 7602 to issue us summons compelling the execution of handwriting samples.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.110" offset="360385">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Stevens joined and Mr. Justice Marshall has also filed a separate dissenting opinion.</text>
