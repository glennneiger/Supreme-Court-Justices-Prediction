            <text syncTime="1604.945" offset="6524197">First of all, the fact that the South Dakota is in the cement business comes as a direct result of the South Dakota citizens being in the teens and the 20s, some 50, 60, 70 years ago, about 70 years ago being unable to get the cement they needed to do the things that normal society carries on, things like building hospitals, building schools, building roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.983" offset="6612281">A good analysis is -- of this is found in the Eakin case that -- that both of us have cited in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.279" offset="6633493">And the South Dakota Supreme Court made very, very specific findings in its determination of the Eakin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.716" offset="6659302">It found, for example, that cement and its products are commodities that are necessary to the people of South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.359" offset="6681872">They cannot be produced at the present time through individual effort, that the construction of highways, bridges, streets, pavings, sidewalks and public buildings within the State, cement is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.925" offset="6724086">They found that the use of cement is rapidly increasing in South Dakota that a serious shortage of the supply of cement is threatening to the people of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.600" offset="6754806">That there had been a shortage on many occasions during the previous years, but the shortage has interfered with and delayed both public and private enterprises, that the materials for making of cement are found in large quantities and at necessary points within the State.</text>
