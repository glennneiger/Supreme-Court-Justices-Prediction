            <label>Mr. Max L. Gillam, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="96.646" offset="490956">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.211" offset="521258">The issue before the Court posed by this appeal is a narrow, very simple issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.717" offset="571308">This arises on an appeal from a judgment of the California Supreme Court which reversed a trial court's rejection of the request for an injunction that the Pruneyard and its owner, Fred Sahadi, be enjoined from denying access to its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.007" offset="672455">In other words, the appellees here moved for an injunction in the lower court to enjoin Mr. Sahadi from refusing to allow them to circulate petitions on his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.628" offset="750926">There was a trial of this request for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.891" offset="771929">Specific findings were made by the trial court as to the existence of adequate available alternatives in that Santa Clara County.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.237" offset="829294">This was coupled with the conclusion of law framed in basically, the terms of Lloyd versus Tanner to the effect that other effective mean -- means of communication existed in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.883" offset="911945">The denial of the injunction was affirmed by the District Court of Appeals and when the case reached the California Supreme Court, that court reversing its prior holding and what is adverted to in the briefs as Diamond II, asserted that the free speech portion of the California Constitution required a reversal of the trial court and the admission to Mr. Sahadi's premises of the persons who wished to circulate petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.035" offset="1088533">This Court, as it did in the Miami Herald case, deferred the question of jurisdiction until the time of the hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.666" offset="1147047">We would -- we have briefed pursuant to this rule's federal -- this Court's Rule 16, at the outset of our brief, the jurisdictional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.705" offset="1191246">It seems obvious that the decision below upheld the validity of a free speech portion of the California Constitution against a contention that the construction sought of that constitutional provision denied Mr. Sahadi and the Pruneyard their rights under the Fifth, Fourteenth and First Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.728" offset="1311305">We would therefore, submit that appeal is the proper remedy that there is federal jurisdiction and not any substantial federal jurisdiction and that in the alternative as we requested in our jurisdictional statement, if this Court should feel that appeal was not the proper route, to please accept certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.188" offset="1433140">I stated at the outset that this was a simple, narrow case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.473" offset="1458322">It does not involve any attempt to regulate the content of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.428" offset="1490087">It does not relate to any ability on the part of Mr. Sahadi to deny his shopping center customers the receipt of any view which the appellees would choose to put upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.514" offset="1550482">The adequate available alternatives finding, we think, is extremely important when it's coupled with the finding that the policy against solicitation was uniformly and disinterestedly -- disinterestedly applied by the center.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.421" offset="1634074">I would like to call your attention to the specific finding on adequate alternatives in Santa Clara County.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.717" offset="1671272">The finding of fact which was entered by the trial court and which was never contested at the trial or any appellate level was stated in the following manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.916" offset="1728010">The county in which the center is located has many shopping centers, public shopping and business areas, public buildings, parks, stadia, universities, colleges, schools, post offices and similar public areas where large numbers of people congregate and where people can freely exercise First Amendment rights including without limitation, distribution of handbills and seeking signatures on petitions.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.417" offset="1894045">Mr. Justice Marshall, I think it's important to focus on this from the standpoint of language you used in Hudgens, because we read your opinion in Hudgens as being concerned with the availability of the means for communicating ideas.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.035" offset="1976487">But we think this is a very key finding of fact which I say, was never challenged and a conclusion of law which then followed after the trial was never challenged and that conclusion was that there are adequate effective channels of communication for plaintiffs other than soliciting on the private property of the center.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.069" offset="2076693">The center with capital C, and it was defined to mean the Pruneyard Shopping Center and its owner, Mr. Fred Sahadi, the alternate, adequate, available, other places in which to solicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.215" offset="2157255">That is the state of the record which is before the Court in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.974" offset="2184317">Well, Mr. Gillam, can't -- couldn't you equally well attack a zoning ordinance by saying that there are other places you could build this same kind of factory and therefore, the State's prohibition of your building adhered -- is unconstitutional?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="545.699" offset="2287240">I would assume that there could be a set circumstances or facts which might permit you that kind of attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.342" offset="2321721">I cannot conceive them as I sit here right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.564" offset="2334678">I know that Agins versus Tiburon is coming up on this Court's docket, which deals with the similar question of whether after engaging in a condemnation proceeding and running out of money, the City of Tiburon could then zone the land it was prepared to condemn.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.495" offset="2402388">So, under certain circumstances, I think you could make that argument, but ordinarily speaking, the right to zone would not involve anything with respect to the property right to the extent that is at issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="590.045" offset="2464559">But it -- isn't it basically the old Mahon versus Pennsylvania Coal case that the State can limit the use of private property or place certain restriction on up to a point, but if it virtually destroys its use or comes close to significantly destroying its use, then it has to -- it has to pay just compensation and it's kind of a hard line to draw?</text>

            <text syncTime="616.608" offset="2570825">I do not believe that it would have to go to the extent to which the Court refers in virtually destroying the value of the land as in a condemnation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.493" offset="2618368">Zoning is an effective condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.552" offset="2630593">This Court in determining whether an interest which the State has denominated a -- an interest in property or the nonexistence of it, has historically applied federal standards to determine whether that which was involved constituted property and imposing the new legal disability on any prior freedom or property invites federal examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.273" offset="2745532">The situation here is, that with respect to soliciting at shopping centers, this California Supreme Court in reliance on this Court's opinion in Logan Valley had held that the shopping center could not exclude expressive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.201" offset="2841245">Subsequent to this Court's opinion in Lloyd versus Tanner, the California Supreme Court reversed that position and held that the shopping centers could, under the federal principles articulated in Lloyd versus Tanner, exclude expressive activity of this type on the assumption if, I should say if, there were adequate available opportunities in the community for expressive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.797" offset="2975619">It was only in this case in which the California Supreme Court by a 4 to 3 majority, changed that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.042" offset="3028595">And in effect, deprived Mr. Sahadi of what had been regarded as a property right up to that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.968" offset="3164223">However, it would necessitate an overruling or a refusal to apply the principles which formed the underpinning of the Lloyd decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.825" offset="3215736">The question in Lloyd really is whether the shopping center was such a creature of the State or the equivalent of a municipality as to -- as to have adopted the position of the State for First Amendment purposes.</text>
