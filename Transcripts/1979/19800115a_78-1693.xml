            <label>Mr. Harlon L. Dalton</label>
            <text syncTime="56.246" offset="328391">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.474" offset="333302">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.048" offset="347512">In this case, the Court is called upon to determine the means by which states and municipalities may acquire rights of way across land allotted to Indians and held in fee by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.082" offset="403728">The precise question presented today is whether the Municipality of Anchorage may, invoking Section 357 of Title 25, acquire a private road running across the allotment of one Bertha Mae Tabbytite by simply taking over that roadway and saying, in effect, “sue me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="100.296" offset="504560">In 1954, Ms. Tabbytite entered onto the land in question and began to homestead it.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.427" offset="537057">Four years later, Respondents, Clarke and Baker, filed a homestead application on an adjoining-80 Acres and, two months after that, bulldozed a road across the Tabbytite allotment without seeking or obtaining her consent and without obtaining an easement from anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.362" offset="624828">Tabbytite protested and continued to protest for the 11 years from the construction of the road in 1958 until this suit was commenced in 1969, without success.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.601" offset="677804">Now, from 1968 to 19 -- 1958, rather, to 1966, Clarke -- neighbors Clarke and Baker interposed three contests to Tabbytite's application for a homestead patent as a result of which, she was unable to perfect that application during the pendency of those contests.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.256" offset="756381">Clarke and Baker, however, were able to obtain, in 1961, a homestead patent for their property and they properly subdivided it into 40 parcels which were essentially sold before this suit was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.269" offset="804446">Also, in 1961, the City of Glen Alps, third-class City of Glen Alps, was incorporated and took over maintenance of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.036" offset="839555">Essentially, that city covered the territory surrounding the property of all of the aforementioned parties to this litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="192.054" offset="871633">It wasn't annexed to Anchorage.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.657" offset="878007">It was just incorporated as a city.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harlon L. Dalton</label>
            <text syncTime="195.301" offset="884590">Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.328" offset="896711">In 1966, apparently despairing of ever obtaining the -- her homestead patent, Tabbytite elected to take her land as an Indian allotment, as she was entitled to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.311" offset="952613">In 1967, she attempted to block the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.459" offset="965256">Prior to that, her attempts to block trespassers essentially amounted to posting “no trespassing” signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.630" offset="997857">In 1967, she tried physically to block the road, but pulled back when Glen Clarke indicated to her that she could be arrested for so doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.541" offset="1033488">At that point, she turned to the Bureau of Indian Affairs with her predicament.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.901" offset="1055013">In 1969, the United States Government instituted this suit to close the road and to seek damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.158" offset="1083956">In 1973, the district court, in fact, awarded damages but declined to enter injunction holding that the road across the Tabbytite allotment constituted a way of necessity, and that to close it would create undue hardship for the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.376" offset="1152920">Now, that determination was reversed by the Ninth Circuit in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.154" offset="1179982">Just a few months before that reversal, however, Anchorage and Glen Alps merged in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.309" offset="1212583">There was a unification of Anchorage and two smaller communities, and as the resulted entity of the Municipality of Anchorage took over maintenance of the road and entered this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.134" offset="1251871">Now, on remand, the Municipality of Anchorage opposed the Government's injunction -- request for injunction on the grounds that its predecessor in interest, Glen Alps, had, in effect, condemned the land inversely back in 1961 when it took over the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.441" offset="1321148">The district court entered two opinions, the second time around, which together held that Glen Alps did not have the power of inverse condemnation and, therefore, had not acquired the land in 1961 but that in 1975, when Anchorage and Glen Alps were unified, Anchorage had effectively obtained the land by inverse condemnation and that that was satisfactory within the meaning of Section 357.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.642" offset="1461896">The Government's position is 180-degrees away from that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.771" offset="1482480">Our position is that, despite the similarity of terminology, inverse condemnation and condemnation are by no means equivalent and, indeed, I may not use the term “inverse condemnation” again today.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.857" offset="1534830">What inverse condemnation is essentially is the second half of a taking by seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.119" offset="1703894">Absolutely and, indeed, one of our contentions is that, though this is somewhere further down the line of my argument, that is a general proposition we're taking our purposeful it is a policy of the United States and the policy of the State of Alaska that those takings proceed by condemnation not by seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.070" offset="1791666">In inverse condemnation actions they brought under the Tucker Act, isn't there a long line of federal authorities holding that if the Government may defend such an action by saying Congress had not authorized the intrusion and, then, the person's remedy is simply to have a person -- have their land back?</text>

            <text syncTime="454.993" offset="1923323">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.525" offset="1945475">The issue before this Court is not whether Anchorage has the power under Alaska law -- eminent domain law to affect takings this by seizure and that's because this land is owned in fee by the United States and absent the consent of the United States, there is no method by which Anchorage can acquire a roadway across the Tabbytite allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.591" offset="2041710">Now, Section 347, on its face, appears to consent to be a waiver of the United States' sovereign immunity with reference to state's attempts to condemn allotted land.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.598" offset="2093746">I suppose it's incumbent upon me to acknowledge, as the Court is aware, that Respondent Tabbytite draws into question whether even Section 357, at this point, constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity when rights of way are at issue and particularly when roadway rights of way are at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.025" offset="2183502">But, if we assume for the moment that Section 357 does apply, it should be construed narrowly, both because it constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity and because takings under it, condemnation under it, in effect, potentially results in derogation of interest of Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.994" offset="2299382">You're denying that there was a taking here, that the Indian inverse condemnation, and the Government, as I remember it, is seeking an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.605" offset="2325817">You want to stop traffic from going over the road until the state institutes a condemnation proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.759" offset="2518392">But, when Glen Alps was involved in this litigation, it, in fact, filed a counterclaim for formal condemnation in the event that its way of necessity argument was rejected by the court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harlon L. Dalton</label>
            <text syncTime="642.495" offset="2673351">Anchorage has insisted in its brief that the term “condemnation” -- that the definition of the term “condemnation” in Section 357 is subject to state law because Section 357 provides that condemnation may proceed under the laws of the states where the property is situated, but we submit that that simply cannot be.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.426" offset="2761122">The term “condemnation” is central to what Congress was about in Section 357.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.140" offset="2779930">It's determinative of the extent of the waiver of sovereign immunity and, to leave states free to define the very right which Congress confers in that section, we submit, would stand the whole notion of consent and waiver on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.113" offset="2847848">The decision below and Anchorage in its brief also suggest that United States seeks to deny Indians the right to bring suits for just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.661" offset="2890062">We certainly don't oppose the rights of Indians to receive just compensation but that, of course, can be obtained in the context of a formal condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.124" offset="2927888">Our point, rather, is that the state cannot relegate Indian allotees to an action for just compensation because, as I indicated in response to your first question, Mr. Chief Justice, the phrase proceeding for just compensation, while fairly mutual on its face, really carries with it the reality that, at some point, a taking by seizure has occurred or is being contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.643" offset="3041991">And, since it's our position that a taking by seizure cannot be squared with Section 357, it is inconsistent to place allottees in the position of having to -- the burden of bringing an action for just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.175" offset="3108028">Now, there may be a case in which there would be inadvertent taking in which an allottee ought to be freed to elect to proceed in an action for just compensation, but that's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.765" offset="3154422">That need not happen pursuant to Section 357.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.628" offset="3165915">That is, as this Court has said more than once, essentially a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.083" offset="3211682">We, of course, acknowledge that seizures by taking do exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.799" offset="3230595">That the Tucker Act, in federal practices is the proceeding by which persons whose land has been taken, may indeed proceed for just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.441" offset="3269151">This existed at the turn of the century at the time 357 was enacted as it exists today.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.234" offset="3288273">In general, we agree that it's an appropriate remedy for inadvertent takings, but it does not follow that this land owner's remedy can be converted into a means by which a sovereign, like the Municipality of Anchorage, can acquire a roadway affirmatively purposefully across an Indian allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.308" offset="3368626">With the Court's permission, I'm looking at the clock, I've got about a minute, I can enter into my next argument or I can pick it up in the morning.</text>
