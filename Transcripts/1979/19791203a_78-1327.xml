            <text syncTime="33.198" offset="236126">I speak for petition of The Boeing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.200" offset="252217">This case is here by writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review a 6-3 en banc decision of that court dealing with what it said it regarded as having unusual significance for the conduct of class action litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.854" offset="338840">Specifically, whether attorneys for plaintiffs who successfully prosecute a Federal class action for money damages are entitled to look for their compensation to the total amount for which a defendant would be liable if all class members perfected their claims by filing proofs of claims or only from the amounts payable to those class members who do file proofs of claim and thus receive the benefits of the legal services rendered by the plaintiffs' attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.772" offset="510412">The Court of Appeals decision here under review held that the plaintiffs' attorneys were entitled to be paid not only from money actually claimed by their client class members but also from unclaimed money which that court in an earlier decision in this very case held will never belong to or become the property of any client of these attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.166" offset="628067">Now, it is the position --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="132.531" offset="633501">What would you think of the hypothetical situation that one of the members of the class wrote in to the Court and said, I think the court has been wrong in the decision, I don't think there is any money due me from Boeing Company, and therefore I refuse to accept it?</text>

            <text syncTime="149.335" offset="700688">Well, Your Honor, I think you have almost that situation right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.881" offset="718869">The brief that is amicus curiaed that has been filed by the Special Master appointed to administer this fund informs the Court that claimant, or rather holders of 128,000 face amount of these debentures have been identified, they have been in touch with and they have declined to file proofs of claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="184.289" offset="840495">But there is no question of their not being reached and told that they could do this.</text>

            <label>Mr. S. Hazard Gillespie</label>
            <text syncTime="195.072" offset="883649">I think that is an an a fortiori case under those circumstances, if he renounces there is no reason why his share of that recovery should be utilized to pay the attorneys for the class members who have claims, under this Court's decision.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="211.749" offset="950418">You think there is no difference then between an affirmative renunciation and a passive, neglectful --</text>

          <turn speaker="s_hazard_gillespie" startTime="219.016" stopTime="484.382">
            <label>Mr. S. Hazard Gillespie</label>
            <text syncTime="219.016" offset="979466">Quite right, Mr. Chief Justice; quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.227" offset="992319">Now, it is our position, or the position of The Boeing Company on this appeal, and it was the position of a panel of the Second Circuit which decided this case prior to the en banc decision, that to allow plaintiffs' attorneys to be compensated for monies that are not claimed is two fundamental errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.664" offset="1102033">One, that it is requiring claiming class members, or it is entitling claiming class members to benefit from monies to which they are not entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.174" offset="1168071">And second, that it would be a direct violation of this Court's holding in the Alyeska Pipeline Company case because the funds which are not claimed would revert to the defendant in the case and therefore if they had skimmed off of them sums to pay the claimants' attorneys, there would be a case of the defendants paying part of the legal expenses of the plaintiffs in violation of this Court's rule in Alyeska that each party should pay its own attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.895" offset="1338911">Now, before proceeding to spell out the detail of that argument I would just take a minute to describe the background of the action against which this question comes to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.897" offset="1390947">This action is the consolidation of ten suits which were commenced in 1966 after Boeing, as part of its program to finance the construction of the 747 Boeing aircraft, called for redemption a $30 million convertible debenture issue which it had sold in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.041" offset="1483525">Under the terms of the indenture pursuant to which these securities were issued, the holders had a specified period after a call for redemption within which to convert their debentures to Common Stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.527" offset="1541517">Otherwise, the holder would be limited in the future to receiving only the face amount of his debenture and not any accrual that might have occurred in the value of the Common Stock at the time of the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.564" offset="1593657">In this instance on the day when the right to convert expired, March 29, 1966, Boeing Common Stock was selling for a price at which $100 of principal amount of debentures if converted would have been worth $316.25, or $216.25 more than its face amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.143" offset="1695953">These convertible debentures were unregistered bearer debentures and after the call for redemption and after the time to convert having expired, 1,544,300 face amount of the 30 million had not been converted.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.476" offset="1769305">Boeing, faced with this problem of what it should do about those who had failed to claim, sought the advice of two law firms, whether in fairness to non-converting holders and also in fairness to its own shareholders, many of which had become shareholders by reason of converting in time, sought the advice of two law firms as to what it should do under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.490" offset="1877347">I emphasize this because this is no case of fraud or impropriety on behalf of anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.688" offset="1906082">They were in a dilemma under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.863" offset="1918830">The two firms advised them that they could not extend the time without violating the provisions of the indenture under which these securities had been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.214" offset="1968253">And under those circumstances Boeing followed the advice and very shortly along came these ten lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.933" offset="1995107">They were consolidated in the Southern District of New York and The Boeing Company moved for class action treatment under Rule 23, which the court granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.258" offset="2056443">Well, the basis of jurisdiction, there were claims made under the Trust Indenture Act and under the Securities Act of 1934.</text>

            <label>Mr. S. Hazard Gillespie</label>
            <text syncTime="509.733" offset="2142333">Well, are you referring to the compensation decision or the original decision under which the District Court dismissed this action on the ground that the indenture had been fully complied with; are you referring to that decision, Your Honor, or are you referring to the compensation decision which is here before the Court?</text>

            <label>Mr. S. Hazard Gillespie</label>
            <text syncTime="529.784" offset="2222477">Well, I think on the first decision, on the merits it is very clear that they went on the Trust Indenture Act and the Federal Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.639" offset="2261974">On the compensation question which is here, I think they went as a matter of general Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.692" offset="2294157">They did not utilize New York law, although New York law in every respect as we see it is the same as Federal law with regard to this question.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="557.133" stopTime="563.353">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="557.133" offset="2331878">This was not in any sense then at any stage of the proceedings a case of pendent jurisdiction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="s_hazard_gillespie" startTime="563.353" stopTime="713.244">
            <label>Mr. S. Hazard Gillespie</label>
            <text syncTime="563.353" offset="2356746">It was not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.324" offset="2364688">Now, the District Court after trial dismissed the complaint here, as I said a moment ago, holding that the indenture had been complied with and that there was no basis for these debenture holders recovering.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.510" offset="2433442">Appealed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit agreed that the indenture had been complied with but concluded that the indenture provisions with regard to notice to these debenture holders did not provide, as they said, "reasonable notice."</text>
            <text syncTime="600.593" offset="2505749">And said that these debenture holders were entitled to recover the difference between the $100 and the $316.25.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.264" offset="2540440">They then sent the case back.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.906" offset="2550993">That first appeal was known as Van Gemert One.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.962" offset="2563218">They sent the case back, the District Court entered a judgment for $3,283,359, which was taking the face amount of the debentures, $1,544,000, and multiplying it by the $216 as to which each of these people were entitled, and said they were entitled to receive that amount of money if claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.755" offset="2658408">And that judgment provided specifically that each member of the class who had not redeemed his debenture, upon surrendering it would get $316 per debenture less his share of the attorneys' fees required to collect this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.173" offset="2748061">Now, if that judgment had stayed the way it was we never would be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.159" offset="2771989">We were satisfied with it as a procedural matter and ready to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.533" offset="2789543">However, the plaintiffs appealed a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.945" offset="2799156">They were not happy.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.372" offset="2804903">And they raised a very important, significant point that is involved in this appeal here at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.455" offset="2837191">They argued in the Second Circuit that the people who claimed were entitled not only to their own $216 over the $100 face amount but also to any amount that was not their share of any amount that was not claimed by one of their fellow class members, called a fluid class recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.590" offset="2949726">And --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="713.244" stopTime="718.944">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="713.244" offset="2956309">Am I right in thinking this is not -- was not an opt in, opt out type of class action?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="s_hazard_gillespie" startTime="718.944" stopTime="796.620">
            <label>Mr. S. Hazard Gillespie</label>
            <text syncTime="718.944" offset="2979192">You are quite right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.170" offset="2988074">This was 23 -- I think it is 1 or 2 -- there was no right to opt out.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.908" offset="3006986">That is quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.069" offset="3011688">So they made that argument to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that they were entitled to get not only that $2.16 but whatever -- on top of that whatever anybody else their share did not claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.878" offset="3066859">The Court of Appeals struck that down.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.406" offset="3080965">They further struck down a second request which was that even if we can't get something for our pockets with regard to this, we at least ought to get the attorney's fees paid from that unclaimed portion as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.306" offset="3140629">And the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit three-judge panel held, no, you are not entitled to that because that itself would be an infringement on our rejection in the Eisen case of the fluid recovery doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.241" offset="3204368">Furthermore, said the court, that would be a violation of the American rule on attorneys' fees as propounded in the Alyeska case because we would be taking money from -- that might go back to Boeing and using it to pay -- help pay the class members who do claim their attorneys' fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.889" offset="4730964">Without repeating our arguments on the brief, there are three principal reasons that we believe the Court of Appeals en banc was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.274" offset="4768475">The most egregious error we believe is in the underlying premise which the majority advances to support its stated desire to avoid, and I quote, "unfairness to claiming class members" and to permit them to enjoy, and I quote, "the spoils of victory."</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.006" offset="5067421">And the Court rejected it and explained the corollary to the American rule of attorneys' fees, that those cases embody and limited it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.787" offset="5114546">That corollary is to the effect that where a prevailing litigant has conferred benefits on other parties that can be identified, that those parties before participating in the benefits of the litigation must share their part of the cost of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.224" offset="5260309">This corollary to the American rule on lawyers' fees is founded on the common law principle against unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.599" offset="5309733">In other words, if somebody -- and it is on this very basis that the claimants who come into this case and collect -- the 46 percent who collect -- must obviously pay their share of the attorneys' fees, and with that we have no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.146" offset="5379950">But that is the principle of those two cases that I just mentioned, Sprague and the Trustees v. Greenough.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.768" offset="6690461">First, we believe that the decision of the Court of Appeals en banc violates the common fund principle of Trustees v. Greenough, as applied in Alyeska, in the opinion in Alyeska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.007" offset="6763395">Second, we believe that no judgment as far as an individual is concerned comes into being until a claim is filed, so that there is no common fund within the principle of those cases until a claim is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.172" offset="6840090">And last, and most important, we believe that any decision which encompasses using some of the unclaimed fund to benefit the claiming members is a clear violation of what is called the fluid class recovery, the rule that if it is a small amount perhaps, it may be fairly large, but it is allowing the claiming members, in effect, to benefit from those who do not claim from that fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.838" offset="6990764">And that has been not only in the Eisen case, in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was that ruled out, but in this very case it was ruled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.359" offset="7028799">And for these reasons, Your Honor, we believe that this Court should reverse the en banc decision of the Second Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2555.934" offset="10327124">Well, sir, the case was decided in Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin that there should be no fluid recovery, under no circumstances could a plaintiff get more than his personal damages; and so I have taken that to be law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.269" offset="10408417">This Court remanded on entirely different ground but it seemed to me approved that holding of the Second Circuit, that there should be no fluid recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.127" offset="10467871">Now, if I may continue then with what I said about the distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.487" offset="10509354">Professor Dawson of the Harvard Law School in the Harvard Law Review has written three articles covering this subject very fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.899" offset="10546970">And he takes the view, or I will quote his words, to the effect that the question here is distributing the loss, distributing the loss which accrues to these plaintiffs by having to pay a fee to get back their money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.494" offset="10629308">And I think when it is presented in that way it is a very clear and correct analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.651" offset="10662013">What we have here is a question of who is going to take the loss of paying a counsel fee for getting back what was due to these people 13 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.638" offset="10713945">Again, I want to say to you that Mr. Gillespie in going over quickly the question of benefit and unjust enrichment and so on has not quoted accurately or fully, I should say, the statement of this Court in Trustees v. Greenough which was when the acting plaintiff recovered the judgment for the benefit of the class of bondholders, he said two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.964" offset="10855215">He said it would be unjust to the plaintiff if he were not reimbursed as well as enriching the other members of the class unjustly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.289" offset="10912580">Now, Mr. Gillespie has some justification for pounding only the second part of that sentence, because the courts have frequently done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.309" offset="10960645">But the true fact is that what Greenough did was to follow the old English cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.740" offset="10986350">A creditor came in with a creditor's bill to save certain property for the benefit of all creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.559" offset="11021563">Somebody who was interested in a charitable trust brought an action to save a charitable trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.952" offset="11051133">Or a creditor brought an adverse petition in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.414" offset="11069001">Now, in all of those cases in England 200 years ago, and in this country ever since, anybody who produced a fund for the benefit of a number of people received reimbursement from that fund for all of the expense of the litigation and the net proceeds of the recovery were distributed among the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.673" offset="11190105">Now this, as Judge Kaufman said, is the unbroken line of precedents in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.353" offset="11228766">This case has nothing to do with Alyeska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.925" offset="11247052">Alyeska involved a case -- involved a situation where there was no fund, there was no fund there, there was a public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.131" offset="11299924">And the doctrine of a private attorney general was adopted by the Court of Appeals in this Circuit and this Court said that that was a different question than the production of a fund and went on to say that the rule which has persisted in this Court since Greenough, which was 1881 -- getting close to a hundred years -- is still the rule in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2866.920" offset="11571075">Now, the Court did not say that there is no such thing as a common benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.941" offset="11599182">In taking up for example the case of Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite, the Court did find that there was a shared benefit and that -- you recall that in that case stockholders brought suit to enjoin a proposed merger between a company which owned 54 percent of the stock and of the merges and that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.011" offset="11743378">Now, in that case this Court held that although there was no specific fund the benefit was for the benefit of all -- was granted to all stockholders because they saved this corporation from a bad merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.803" offset="11818611">Now, that I believe is the first real common benefit case decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.027" offset="11855496">And then it went on to the Hall v. Cole case where it was decided that it was for the benefit of all the members of the union that the protagonists had provided freedom of speech for all members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.291" offset="11916518">Now, those to the best of my knowledge are the only two common benefit cases decided here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3732.246" offset="15032404">Then it goes on and says, ordered that the members of the plaintiffs' committee be awarded their fees, expenses and disbursements fixed by the court to be paid out of said total amount of this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.344" offset="15080782">Now, we were faced when we saw that judgment with the fact that unless we raised that point now this would be final.</text>
