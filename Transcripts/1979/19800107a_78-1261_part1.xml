            <text syncTime="95.947" offset="487111">This case arose after respondent's son, Joseph Jones, died in a prison hospital in Terre Haute, Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.622" offset="521906">A year later, the respondent brought suit as administratrix of Jones' estate and as Jones' next of kin alleging that her son's death was the result of grossly inadequate and inappropriate medical treatment in violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="156.658" offset="730049">-- a doctor's aide and a hospital guard at the Terre Haute Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.707" offset="746245">All defendants were sued in their individual as well as their official capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.759" offset="766412">The respondent asked for $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.488" offset="797341">The District Court in the Southern District of Indiana held that respondent had sufficiently alleged a cause of action for damages directly under the Eighth Amendment under the theory of this Court's decisions in Bivens and Estelle v. Gamble, but it dismissed the complaint on jurisdictional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.077" offset="867662">The court held that under the particular facts of this case, Indiana law limited respondent's recovery on account of her son's death to the reasonable hospital medical and burial expenses and expenses of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.753" offset="922415">The court held that it was therefore apparent that respondent could not satisfy the $10,000 jurisdictional amount requirement for federal question jurisdiction under 27 U.S.C 1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.647" offset="969958">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.702" offset="986154">The Court of Appeals agreed with the District judge that the respondent had stated a Bivens type cause of action for damages directly under the Eighth Amendment, but it refused to apply the Indiana survival and wrongful death provisions to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.119" offset="1043832">The Court of Appeals stated, "Whenever the relevant state survival statute would abate a Bivens type action brought against defendants whose conduct results in death, the federal common law allows survival of the action."</text>
            <text syncTime="250.208" offset="1104227">I should add at this point, although I hope to come back to it later, that while it is true that by applying the Indiana survival statutes, respondent's claims would abate, that is because of the federal jurisdictional amount in controversy requirement and not because of any provisions of the Indiana statutes themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.782" offset="1178520">Now, the petition in this case presents two independent questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.754" offset="1194402">The first is whether it is proper for the courts to apply a Bivens type cause of action directly under the Eighth Amendment in instances where an existing federal statute, here the Federal Tort Claims Act, provides an adequate federal damages remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.450" offset="1261171">The second question, which need only be reached if the Court disagrees with petitioners' first point and holds that an Eighth Amendment cause of action exists, is whether the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the survival of respondent Bivens' action is governed by federal common law rather than by the state statutes that apply to analogous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.692" offset="1350092">I would like to turn first to the question of implying a constitutional cause of action for damages directly under the Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment clause in the circumstances of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.560" offset="3133628">We believe, on the other hand, that implication of constitutional causes of action for damages are not compelled but rather are, as Justice Powell stated last term in Davis v.

General Services Administration, in Butz v. Economou, and in Davis v.

            <text syncTime="921.875" offset="3790869">In fact, in Davis itself the Court stated in at least five separate places in the opinion that plaintiff had no other federal damages remedy available to her and therefore that the Fifth Amendment should provide one.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.026" offset="3843427">Therefore, if the Tort Claims Act is as we believe an adequate substitute for a Bivens claim such as the one respondent has alleged under the Eighth Amendment, we think that this Court's prior decisions lead to the conclusion that the statutory remedy alone should be pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.683" offset="3910092">I would like to turn then to respondent's argument that the Tort Claims Act is not an act which substitutes for an Eighth Amendment Bivens action.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.363" offset="3940812">Now, the respondent has catalogued a number of differences between the two types of actions, but in our view the relevant question is not whether the Tort Claims Act constitutes a remedy identical in every respect to that provided in Bivens, but rather whether the federal statute can and fully compensate for victims of unlawful government conduct such as that alleged respondent's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.772" offset="4046451">We think that the answer to that question is plainly yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.216" offset="4644237">That was the paragraph to which I referred a moment ago, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, saying that at the very end in the final count there is an allegation which incorporates all the previous allegations and essentially says in conclusory language that they were done maliciously and intentionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.722" offset="4706304">But if you go through the key portions of the complaint, which are paragraphs 1 through 18, there are allegations of gross negligence, negligence albeit of a gross nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.174" offset="4760116">It seems to us clear that if the events that occurred in this case had not occurred in a prison hospital with federal doctors but they had occurred in a private hospital with a private patient, the same exact events, there would be no question that what would be brought is a tort suit under a state negligence law, a malpractice law, and there would be fully adequate remedy available to compensate the plaintiff for his injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.577" offset="4861680">There is no allegation here that Indiana law is in any way deficient in allowing a plaintiff to recover if he has been the victim of malpractice such as has been alleged on pages 10 and 11 of this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.275" offset="4924479">But the respondent nonetheless points to a number of features of the Tort Claims Act suit that she claims makes the statutory remedy wholly inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.820" offset="4962617">First, she notes that the Tort Claims Act has an administrative exhaustion procedure and that jury trials are not available, but these differences we think really relate to the procedures of adjudication and not to the fairness or completeness of the compensation that may ultimately be awarded to a successful litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.652" offset="5042030">And I might add that the same restrictions involving exhaustion of remedies and the absence of a jury trial are present under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, yet the Court in Brown v. General Services Administration held that Title VII is an adequate substitute for a Bivens action and for other statutory remedies challenging racial discrimination under the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.157" offset="6331956">Now, the other thing to be said about the 1974 Senate report, Mr. Justice White, is that there is clearly the suggestion, at least the understanding on the part of the author of the report that Bivens was a constitutionally compelled remedy, because on the same page of the Senate report on which the sentence appears that you just read, there is the statement that in Bivens the Court held that the Fourth Amendment requires the availability of a damages action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.890" offset="6442924">Now, to the extent that Congress thought that Bivens actions were constitutionally required and that Congress couldn't abrogate them even if it wanted to, I think the statement in the Senate report is merely an attempt to avoid what might be viewed by some legislators as a possible constitutional problem if it were thought that the 2680(h) remedy was intended to abrogate the Bivens action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.413" offset="6529024">But once again we are not dealing with the 2688 claim here, it is not a tort such as Congress allowed to be pursued under the Tort Claims Act for the first time in 1974, it is a negligence action which has always existed under the Tort Claims Act and there is certainly no reason to believe that Congress thought that the state laws which were incorporated in the Tort Claims Act for negligence or medical malpractice albeit of an egregious kind, was not an adequate remedy and that therefore Bivens actions would have to continue to be recognized despite the adequacy of the statutory remedy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Deutsch</label>
            <text syncTime="1723.323" offset="6996616">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.923" offset="7011035">My name is Michael Deutsch, and I am the attorney for the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.080" offset="7027649">The government urges before this Court two related theories which would provide no remedy at all for the decedent in this case, despite the serious deprivations of the Bill of Rights that he has suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.538" offset="7085537">It is imperative that the Court properly understand the claims that we brought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.530" offset="7105494">We brought a claim for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs causing death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.837" offset="7130676">This Court in Estelle v. Gamble held that that claim in that language, and the District Court found it and the Court of Appeals found it, created an Eighth Amendment violation for cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.638" offset="7181876">It recognized that this man, Joseph Jones, was in the custody of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.585" offset="7201729">He could not walk down the street and get medical care, he had to rely on the government to give him that medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.956" offset="7227225">And when he went out to a private hospital and the doctor there said transfer this man to another prison because he had asthma and the government ignored that, and when the doctor of the private hospital said give this man medication for his asthma and the government ignored that, and when the man predictably had a serious asthma attack and when he went to the hospital for eight hours no doctor from the Bureau of Prisons came to see him, and when the respirator didn't work, even though they knew for two weeks that it wasn't working, and when they gave him Thorazine which killed him, and that hospital, even though Thorazine is clearly contra-indicated for asthma -- we say that is cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.999" offset="7383333">And what Justice Marshall said in Estelle, in the worst cases it causes torture and lingering death, and that is what Joseph Jones suffered and that is what we allege and that is what the courts below found, based on the truth of the allegations in our complaint as the court must take them to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.195" offset="7460133">And we also claim that government deprived him of life without due process of law, a Fifth Amendment claim. Clearly it is recognized as one under the Fifth Amendment, as well as that deprivation was caused by racial animus, another equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.410" offset="7528991">We do not allege medical malpractice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.785" offset="7538500">We do not allege battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.381" offset="7544874">We do not allege any tort or any negligence theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.190" offset="7560129">We come here and we have come to the federal court with a violation of a fundamental protection of the Bill of Rights against federal officers in a federal prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.147" offset="7603911">Now, I ask you, why doesn't Bivens apply to that claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.386" offset="7620942">Is not the Eighth and the Fifth Amendment an independent limitation on the power of the federal government?</text>
