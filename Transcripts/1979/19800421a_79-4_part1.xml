            <label>Mr. William A. Wenzel, III</label>
            <text syncTime="90.062" offset="463600">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.536" offset="481468">I'm appearing here today on behalf of Jeffrey C. Miller, the acting Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.718" offset="506232">Director Miller, the defendant below, appeals the ruling of the District Court which invalidated Illinois Public Act 80-1091 as violative of the equal protection of the laws for women who are seeking medically necessary abortions, but not abortions which were necessary to preserve their lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.470" offset="585226">The issue today before the Court is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.254" offset="608423">First, there is the equal protection issue, whether or not the State may validly limit abortion funding under its medical assistance programs to instances where the mother's life would be preserved taking into account the State's interest in fetal life and also taking into account the State's willingness to fund alternative treatments to abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.992" offset="691388">The second issue really should be discussed first, because it certainly shapes and clarifies equal protection issue, that issue is, what is the State's obligations under Title XIX of the Social Security Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="160.570" offset="745618">A short background would be appropriate to bring these issues into focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.532" offset="765471">The Illinois Generally Assembly in December of 1977 enacted on a Public Act P80-1091 in response to two federal initiatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.323" offset="808626">Earlier that year, this Court had issued it's rulings in the cases of Maher versus Roe, Beal versus Doe and Poelker versus Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.832" offset="842689">Those cases stand for the proposition that indigent pregnant women have no constitutional right, nor statutory entitlement to a nontherapeutic abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.157" offset="892008">Earlier, United States Congress, as was explored in a case that just preceded us, had enacted the first version of the Federal Hyde Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.911" offset="930983">The Federal Hyde Amendment limited abortion funding under the Medicaid Act, except where an abortion was necessary to avoid the endangerment of the woman's life.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="217.644" offset="973928">Mr. Wenzel, just a -- let me see if I understand the appropriate statutory context to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.572" offset="1009664">When Title XIX was originally enacted, the criminal laws of many, if not most States, made the performance of an abortion a serious offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.689" offset="1074134">And I suppose that nobody could have argued back in those days in 1965 when Title XIX was enacted by the Congress that Title XIX authorized or directed the States, let alone authorized them to pay for therapeutic abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.234" offset="1164309">Is that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="266.570" offset="1169638">And then came along this decision -- this Court's decisions in Roe and Doe, Bolton and thereafter, I suppose it was clear that Title XIX, this is prior to any Hyde Amendment, authorized and directed the States to cooperatively finance such therapeutic abortion.</text>

            <text syncTime="717.541" offset="2973550">Essentially, this dispute is a result of a footnote in the Court's ruling in Beal versus Doe, it said that serious questions would be raised if the Court – if the States intended to exclude medically necessary care and the Court in that opinion also made reference to the definition of medical necessity in Doe versus Bolton which said that an abortion is necessary when a physician exercising his professional judgment in light of all factors whether they'd be physical, emotional, psychological, economic, familial age, all of those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.597" offset="3149720">If they're relevant to health, the doctor should be giving that leeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.868" offset="3170826">That is an appropriate standard within the context of litigation dealing with criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.344" offset="3204786">We feel that it is wholly inappropriate to impose that the District Court did below the Doe versus Bolton definition with medical necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.499" offset="3257344">What that does in effect is to transform the Medicaid program into a program run and controlled by providers as opposed to being run and controlled by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.915" offset="3311052">The State under Medicaid has discretion as we pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.820" offset="3326621">Illinois has exercised that discretion, has made exclusions beyond merely abortions.</text>

            <text syncTime="847.742" offset="3494327">Congress by repealing in 1972, the requirement that the States achieve a goal of comprehensive medical care by 1975, left intact the original intent, which was merely to provide adequate care.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.165" offset="4680077">I represent the intervenors in both cases, but I am addressing myself to the Zbaraz case this morning and in the course of the limited time that I have, I hope to be able to address the nature of the right to privacy within the context of the Constitution and whether the Hyde Amendment infringes on that right especially through penalty analysis and I hope also to be able to address the appropriations issue which raises another theory of constitutional issue for this Court, that at a minimum would counsel restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.691" offset="4822183">With regard to the nature of the right to privacy, may I point out that the Court's use of the term, “a child birth” in the Maher decision was used interchangeably with the language of normal childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.048" offset="4899610">So for example, at -- at page 474 of the U.S. Reports in -- in Maher, the Court had said that it implies no limitation on the authority of a State to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion and to implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.393" offset="4988949">It is our position that the – that at least to that time that the use of childbirth and normal childbirth when used by the Court interchangeably and that in any event the -- the Court's ruling was with regard to their being no limitation on the authority of the State to make a value judgment favoring childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.413" offset="5068988">Similarly, with regard to the -- the Maher test of the – the Maher test is – as we understand, was a test that used three words as the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.973" offset="5127293">The words of unduly, burdensome, interference, an adverb, an adjective and a noun and we would take the position that with all respect that the adverb is not violated, that the adjective is not violated and that the noun standing alone is not violated either, that there is indeed, no interference by the State or by Congress here with the defined right to privacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.042" offset="5987558">The test that was established by this Court for interference is that test of an unduly burdensome interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.860" offset="6018800">So presumably, the Court would still allow even an interference and we would assert that in this instance, there is not even that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.851" offset="6054745">That there is the full regard and the full preservation of the woman's right to privacy in this instance, that penalty analysis consequently is peculiarly inappropriate in the type of a situation in which there is full respect of the exercise of that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.973" offset="6123290">Now, if the position that is advocated by the plaintiffs were to prevail here, the legislature would be reduced to the position of implementing a notion of neutral principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.602" offset="6181804">There would be no purpose served in having election or there would be no purpose served in stimulating people to participate in those elections, quite to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.587" offset="6221720">The consequence would be that it would make no difference because anytime a legislature wished to exercise the initiative or make the value judgment to fund A, it would be required at the same time to fund non-A or anti-A and consequently to reduce the legislature to engaging in mere empty rituals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2332.388" offset="9432900">The plaintiffs did not claim that they were harmed at all by reason of the Hyde Amendment and the District Court obedient to the mandate, considered it.</text>
