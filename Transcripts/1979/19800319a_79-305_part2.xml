            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="261.269" offset="1148426">A couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.332" offset="1160652">First of all, I wanted to be clear with regard to the question that Justice White asked earlier about whether the interrogation itself is a fruit of the illegal seizure that that was true in Walder, that was true in Harris, that was true in Hass.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.436" offset="1245080">And therefore, in order to base a decision affirming the Court of Appeals in this case on that ground, you would have to retrace steps that you've already taken in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.382" offset="1292936">Now, it seems to me that what we have here is basically the straightforward exclusionary rule policy case with which the Court has often been confronted, balancing the values of accurate trial outcomes and particularly, the value of -- of exposing false testimony on the one hand against the deterrent values of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.434" offset="1393142">And I think that the balance has basically already been struck in Harris and in Hass.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.473" offset="1433266">The Court made clear there.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.514" offset="1441416">It stated explicitly that keeping the evidence out of the prosecution's case in chief is sufficient deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.911" offset="1470986">We're now in the area of speculation which respondent engages in about whether the distinction between impeach and cross-examination answers an impeaching direct examination testimony, and as we've seen earlier in the argument of this case, that can be a very fuzzy distinction, will materially alter the behavior of police officers and secure a greater degree of compliance with the dictates of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.421" offset="1585089">Essentially, the argument that the prosecution will arm itself with means of keeping the defendant off the stand was an argument that was equally applicable in Harris and in Hass.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.261" offset="1640364">And indeed, in Hass, that was the very argument that was made that the prosecution -- that the police there having given Miranda warnings and the defendant having asked for a lawyer, they could do nothing to get a statement that would be admissible on the Miranda at that point, therefore, they had every incentive to go ahead and collect this evidence for possible use for impeachment purposes and the Court refused to --</text>
