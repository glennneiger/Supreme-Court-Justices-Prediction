            <text syncTime="923.495" offset="3799395">I find it that my time has run to the point where I must very brief about the background facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.286" offset="3834608">The difficultly in the case arises because in 1868 when the Sioux Nation severed or relinquished the large part of its territory, it was provided among other things that no further secession should be accomplished, should be valid except with the concurrence of three fourths of the adult male members.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.332" offset="3946726">That treaty in 1868 had made a number of provisions which were designed to make, to encourage, furnish incentives by way of money and -- and material aid to the Sioux to become farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.199" offset="4014226">However, it had wholly failed in that respect and shortly after the 1868 Treaty, the background situation against which this transaction must be judged included these elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.977" offset="4089354">The first gold reports had come, that the Black Hills were rich in gold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.070" offset="4117671">Those reports had begun as early as 1868 and indeed some miners had intruded that early.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.435" offset="4159154">Gradually, the invasion multiplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.287" offset="4174618">There were concededly serious governmental efforts to prevent the miners from intruding and indeed to remove them from that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.896" offset="4221012">Those efforts continued between the date of the Treaty in 1868 and the end of 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.397" offset="4263016">They were however largely unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.298" offset="4278585">No doubt, the greed for gold exceeded the fear of the soldiers and the invasion of the miners became in effect, unstoppable, at least without dedicating the entire army resources to that single purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.297" offset="4410556">Mr. Justice Blackmun, the reason for that exchange which suggests that in the view of one general, the President might wink at some invasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.635" offset="4456009">On the other hand, there are concededly instances in which the army did arrest, did remove, did incarcerate miners who had penetrated into the Black Hills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.215" offset="4502298">It's a matter of timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.522" offset="4511493">Towards the end of 19 -- of 1875, the President had determined that this was an impossible policy and he eventually abandoned it by withdrawing his orders to the troops, though he did not publish them in November 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.936" offset="4593204">Now, another aspect of the background of the case is the conceded dependence of the Sioux on governmental food rations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.274" offset="4626536">As I have said, the Treaty of 1868 which it sought to make the Sioux self-sufficient farmers had entirely failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.072" offset="4661750">The Sioux in 1875 and 1876 and 1877 were still wholly dependent on the government for rations, the government expending something over a million dollars a year for that purpose alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.327" offset="4726742">The Sioux Treaty of 1868 had provided that rations should continue for four years, but gratuitously, without any legal obligation, the Congress continued those appropriations for two or three years more and the Congress was unhappy with the prospect that that situation might continue indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.304" offset="4842621">After all, guardian, though it was, the guardian is not normally expected to put his hand in his own pocket for the sake of his ward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.919" offset="4885044">Another consideration that is an important background of the case is the value of the Black Hills to the Sioux themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.705" offset="4916287">They knew there was gold there, but they had no intention of removing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.562" offset="4935617">There was no large gain in the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.849" offset="4944812">This was not the haunting ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.745" offset="4956411">There was valuable grazing in agricultural land, but it appears that it had been put at this period to very little use by the Sioux.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.385" offset="4994968">And finally, because of the miners coming in, there had been clashes between the miners and the Indians and there was a prospect that that conflict between those two forces would escalate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.467" offset="5059333">In these circumstances, Congress determined at a much patient consideration, that the only practical, the only realistic solution is to persuade the Sioux cede the hills and that determination in the mind of the executive and legislative branches of the United States had occurred by the beginning of 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.390" offset="5154941">President had the area surveyed with the view determining its value so that a fair equivalent could be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.358" offset="5194856">He invited the Sioux leaders to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.827" offset="5208754">He appointed a Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.588" offset="5215754">That Commission, the Allison Commission failed and this is all in 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.456" offset="5239265">Upon the failure of any agreement, Congress considered the matter and while it is not really relevant to determine precisely what threats were made about cutting off rations since this is not a case based on duress, it is nevertheless important to note that Congress at no time ever cut off the rations, and indeed never threatened to cut off the rations except a year hence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.347" offset="5378759">In all events, a new Commission was formed, that Commission ultimately reached an agreement with the Sioux leaders albeit the requisite number of members did not sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.593" offset="5427764">That agreement, later ratified by Congress in the 1877 Act, provided relevantly in Section 5 that in consideration, and those of the words of the agreement and of the Act, in consideration of the cession of the Hills, several undertakings were made by the United States, the important one which was a promise to provide rations for so long as the Sioux might need them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.215" offset="5554301">Congress was well aware that it had just appropriated in the preceding years over a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.982" offset="5577394">It had deleted a provision that rations would continue for only ten years more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.383" offset="5602994">This was entirely open ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.020" offset="5613547">Congress was obviously aware that it was undertaking a very substantial burden.</text>

            <text syncTime="1403.379" offset="5718977">There was a finding by the Court of Claims itself in 1942 when this case first reached that Court that as of 1942, the total amount had been some $43 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.662" offset="5772058">Even allowing for discount, considering that the payments in the first 20 years exceeded or averaged something over $1 million dollars a year, it is evident that the United States not only paid the interest but repaid the principal long before 1942 or the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.382" offset="5934958">There is one irony about this case which is that the question of taking would not be here at all if either the 1968 Act did not provide that the signature of the Sioux leaders was not sufficient in this, and therefore become a proper treaty or if they -- three quarters of the members had been persuaded to sign because no matter what duress, no matter how unconscionable were considerations, no matter how dishonorable the dealings, no court has ever found the taking when there was an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.017" offset="6085528">Compensation may be due because advantage was taken of the Indians and they're entitled to an award for the difference but not for the interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1516.059" offset="6169642">After all, the dependence of the Sioux on their rations might have informed callous executives and a callous Congress to simply wait until such time as the Sioux having been cut off which they were was so desperate that they would indeed, sign.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.414" offset="6259085">Indeed an irony here is the Sioux who in a companion case involving the 1868 Treaty have recovered subject to offsets, something over $40 million on the ground that they were grossly underpaid, that's more grossly than here, will not proceed interest on that reward -- on that award.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.668" offset="6648101">It specified exactly, a pound of flour, a pound and a half of beef and so forth per day per person.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.097" offset="6721766">Now, we believe that the Court of Claims went astray in two respects and I must be prompt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.372" offset="6742873">First, we think the Court of Claims, applying its own good faith test, presumed the wrong way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.277" offset="6778504">It should have accorded to Congress the presumption of good faith as the Lone Wolf case teaches us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.586" offset="6811732">Rebuttable presumption, if the evidence is overwhelming at the contrary, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.698" offset="6836182">But instead, the Court of Claims relied on the failure of Congress expressly to say, “We all hereby, granting a fair equivalent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.084" offset="6873799">They did say, this is in consideration of -- we must assume they meant a fair consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.455" offset="6903265">Now, secondly, it seemed to me -- seem to us that the Court of Claims too narrowly focused on the question of monetary equivalents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.636" offset="6944016">The United States as guardian is not merely a land manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.409" offset="6959062">It has broader duties and in the special exigent circumstances with which it was faced here, it may have been in the interest of the Sioux to acquire even for less than full value, this land relatively useless to them, in order to avoid all the dangers, including the danger that that land would be lost to the miners for nothing, including the danger that if they did not sell it, If it was not acquired, they would be without rations, Including the danger of that hostilities between them and the miners, would endanger the future of the Sioux Nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1834.973" offset="7445358">The issue in this case is whether the Act of February 28, 1877, effected a taking of the Sioux Black Hills Country in violation of the Fifth Amendment for which just compensation must be paid under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.865" offset="7516829">It is the Act of 1877 that affected the taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.691" offset="9900136">First, the United States created this crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.467" offset="9911317">It wasn't the Indians who created it, it was the United States who created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.720" offset="9928349">The United States took the bulk of the Sioux land under the 1868 Treaty and as Government counsel has already pointed out, paid them $40 million less than the land was worth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.288" offset="9994595">Then the United States kept them from their hunting grounds so they became dependent on the United States for food.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.981" offset="10021345">Then the United States first encouraged the miners to come in and then withdrew the troops.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.239" offset="10050393">Then the United States rounded up the Sioux and put them on them on the reservation and took their guns and horses so they couldn't hunt and there, we had this crisis that the United States created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.616" offset="10095846">Now, let us assume the United States didn't have enough money to handle that crisis other than to take the Black Hills away from the Sioux which is exactly what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.473" offset="10139314">All we say, “It is okay, pay us” and that is what the United States did not do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.100" offset="10225831">And I think Mr. Justice Stewart, you put your finger on it right at the beginning because the Government concedes it hasn't paid us and it concedes it owes us under some theory, under the Indian Claims Commission Act.</text>
