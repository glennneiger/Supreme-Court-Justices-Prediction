            <label>Mr. Albert N. Proujansky</label>
            <text syncTime="73.006" offset="395368">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.731" offset="410311">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.571" offset="437687">The issue involved in this case is a novel one and has not had judicial determination before the determination made by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.121" offset="483871">It involves the issue of whether or not under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which authorizes the award of attorneys fees as a part of costs to a prevailing party, whether that statute extends to state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.467" offset="601213">This case was initiated in early 1975 by the filing of a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.102" offset="655757">In accordance with the statute, the matter was referred to the State of New York which has an anti-discrimination statute and has had one prior to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.905" offset="711032">In accordance with the procedures under the state statute, the hearing was held and the complainant was awarded an affirmative judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.516" offset="765471">The employer was directed to offer her an opportunity to accept employment, which was done, and she is currently an employee of the New York Gaslight Club, and back pay to compensate her for the loss of wages that she sustained as a result of the conduct found to be violative of the statute, was awarded to her and paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.352" offset="868812">While this matter was proceeding before the state court or before the state civil rights division and subsequently the state courts, the attorney for the complainant importuned EEOC for the issuance of a right to sue letter which the EEOC granted to him in July of 1977, and in September of 1977 he commenced an action in federal court seeking to redress the same grievance which was then before the state board.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.955" offset="1039235">At that stage, at the time of the commencement of this action, at the time of the issuance of the right to sue letter, the commissioner of the New York Human Rights Division had awarded relief to the plaintiff, all of the relief to which she was entitled.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="250.827" offset="1106631">Mr. Proujansky, you just referred to the commencement of this action, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.029" offset="1139440">As one reads through the '64 federal act and the '76 Attorneys Fee Amendment, you read the terms "action" or "proceedings" and "actions" -- do you think that Congress was extremely careful and precise in the terms it chose as between "actions" and "proceedings" and "commencement" in those various acts, or do you think that it may have occasionally simply used one as the synonym for another?</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert N. Proujansky</label>
            <text syncTime="302.588" offset="1313729">I think if Your Honor contrasts the language with respect to attorneys fees as contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act with the language that appears in the Civil Rights Act, we have a difference between day and night.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.656" offset="1374020">In the Fair Labor Standards Act, the statute says specifically that an action under this act can be maintained in federal or state courts and any judgment shall include an award of attorneys fees in addition to costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.242" offset="1444342">Now, the statute --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="337.584" offset="1453746">Of course, the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in '38 and that doesn't necessarily mean that a Congress sitting in '64 or '76 might not have used somewhat more ambiguous language and still meant the same thing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_n_proujansky" startTime="353.621" stopTime="491.268">
            <label>Mr. Albert N. Proujansky</label>
            <text syncTime="353.621" offset="1517902">It is hard to determine exactly what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.838" offset="1534725">There is very little legislative history, as this Court has pointed out with respect to section 706(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="364.070" offset="1559698">But if we look at the purpose and the procedure of the two statutes contrasting the federal procedure with the state procedure, perhaps some insight will flow therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.355" offset="1604838">Under the EEOC, assuming we have -- the state of New York had no anti discrimination statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.041" offset="1635558">A complaint would be filed before the EEOC, no hearing would be held and investigation would be conducted by the EEOC and then either the commission itself or would commence an action under federal court and it would by a right to sue letter authorize the complaint into commence and action in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.149" offset="1723956">The statute that we are dealing with 706 (k) follows closely after a number of sections dealing solely with procedural or as distinguish from substantive matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.604" offset="1781739">There is no constitutional right to attorney's fees, and only this morning Judge Powell announced the decision in which he noted that the American rule is that attorney's fees are not normally paid, it depends upon the existence of the statutory exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.525" offset="1853524">Now it is most unusual for congress to pass a low with respect to of course in the state of New York or in any of the individual state.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.003" offset="1907336">Had Congress intended that attorneys fees as a part of course that was the language of the statute, was to be applied in state court proceedings, it seems to me that Congress should have made clear its intent so to do and absence such indication I draw the consequent inference that Congress did not intent this statute to apply the state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.128" offset="2015901">The whole -- all of the proceedings sections FGHJK relate solely to matters dealing with federal court proceedings.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="491.268" offset="2068459">Well, I don't read the Second Circuit's opinion as holding that if the respondent here had simply gone before the New York Human Relations Commission and appealed to the New York courts and never filed an EEOC complaint that nonetheless state courts of New York would have been obligated to award her attorneys fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.508" offset="2161455">Just because the filing in the federal court that brings into play the '76 amendment, isn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert N. Proujansky</label>
            <text syncTime="522.336" offset="2192697">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, as I read the Circuit Court of Appeals decision, they framed the issue as to whether or not an attorney is entitled to compensation for services rendered in a state court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.358" offset="2248808">As I read their decision, they authorized the commencement of a suit in the federal courts solely for the purpose of collecting attorneys fees, even if the matter has been successfully concluded in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.206" offset="2304188">They have extended 706(k) far beyond what I think Congress intended it to be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.389" offset="2352880">There is no need, in my view, for that extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.618" offset="2373883">The human rights law functioned very satisfactorily in New State prior to the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.208" offset="2416201">Judge Monticello in the Lopino case, which is cited in my brief at a lower stage referred to the fact "the state division has a staff of competent attorneys to aid potential claimants and thus it is not necessary to retain private counsel to obtain relief from that agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.230" offset="2500315">"A hearing is conducted before the New York State agency, the hearing officer develops a record with or without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.091" offset="2531767">As a matter of fact, in this case, with respect to the principal witness, Mr. John Anderson, who testified in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.789" offset="2562487">The cross-examination by the complainant's counsel took eleven pages of stenographic minutes, the interrogation by the hearing officer took 23 pages of stenographic minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.089" offset="2611702">The Human Rights Division in New York functions very well and adequately protects complainants, and I am totally appalled as a citizen of New York State by the position of the Attorney General of the State of New York in the amicus brief which he filed in this case, where he totally denigrates the activities or the ability of the State Human Rights Commission to function adeuqately.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.931" offset="2715146">I think he should be here standing up for the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.310" offset="2732596">In fact, if there is anything wrong with the manner in which the Human Rights Commission functions, why isn't the Attorney General paying attention to what the Human Rights Commission is doing, instead of saying no, we need the intervention of attorneys because New York has a fiscal problem, and this is going to save it some money.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.052" offset="2807620">I don't think these principles should be decided on the basis of the fiscal problems of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.777" offset="2858506">Moreover, I would like to point out that under 706(k), 7O6(k) which to some extent uses the same language as section 54 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, refers to attorneys fees being awarded to a prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.145" offset="2947950">Now, there is no question that Ms. Carey was the prevailing party in the state courts, but Ms. Carey was not the prevailing party in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.821" offset="2986611">The federal court action was dismissed as moot, with the consent of Ms. Carey's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.820" offset="3022660">The only thing that was retained was that part of the cause of action which sought to recover attorneys fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.130" offset="3047842">Now, this whole procedure that has been adopted here was one that was calculated to get to this point where the attorney for Ms. Carey can get attorneys fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.140" offset="3091937">Under the provisions of Title VII, a complaint should be filed in the state -- with a state agency if the state has an agency which provides for redress against discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.876" offset="3154840">That was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.695" offset="3162154">The complaint was initially filed before the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.591" offset="3185768">After the plaintiff had won at the first stage of the proceedings before the State Human Rights Division, counsel for Ms. Carey began to importune the EEOC to issue a right to sue letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.045" offset="3263509">Ultimately that right to sue letter was granted in July of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.006" offset="3283362">In August of 1977, the employers appealed to the Human Rights Appeal Board and resulted in an affirmance of the earlier decision of the Commissioner of Human Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.285" offset="3352534">On September 30th, Ms. Carey commenced an action in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.181" offset="3388061">At stage stage, virtually at the same time that the action was commenced in federal court, counsel for the employer filed a petition for review in the appellate division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.091" offset="3467786">This review resulted on November 3, 1977 in an affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.234" offset="3500283">Thereafter, leave to appeal was sought and was denied, and the matter was closed as far as the state courts were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.627" offset="3533928">The award made was satisfied, the complainant was hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.966" offset="3575202">The question has arisen in the Circuit Court of Appeals as to whether or not in making an interpretation of 706(k) we are saddling the federal courts and the federal agencies with a great deal of work by awarding attorneys fees or are we lessening their burden by denying attorneys fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.520" offset="3685439">If this case is any example, in an effort to obtain attorneys fees, they have involved unnecessarily the EEOC in this case, they have involved the federal courts unnecessarily in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.387" offset="3748968">The question of attorneys fees is a matter, as Judge Morgan pointed out in the dissent in the Circuit Court of Appeals, "it seems to me to be fundamental that remuneration of private counsel successful in state agency and state judicial proceedings in vindicating rights under state law should be determined by the law of the state which established the substantive right, created the agency and provided for judicial review."</text>
            <text syncTime="948.552" offset="3897553">I have serious question in my mind as to whether or not if this statute be construed to impose costs in state court proceedings, whether it does not run a foul of the Tenth Amendment which reserves to the states the rights to control their courts and procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.894" offset="3994937">I wish to point out further that when the 1964 act was enacted, Congress knew what the procedure would be in a federal court and they knew because they were establishing an appropriate procedure, they knew whether costs or attorneys fees should be awarded, whether there was a need for attorneys fees to be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.170" offset="4100054">But in 1964 there were very few state anti-discrimination statutes and Congress did not set out any procedural safeguards as to the method in which anti-discrimination claims should be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.942" offset="4175182">This was left to the various states to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.148" offset="4192005">Conceivably, many of the states, as does New York, provide some alternative means in lieu of awarding attorneys fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.901" offset="4239026">If those means -- those means may or may not be adequate, but I suggest that that is a matter that ought to be left to the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.583" offset="4281657">I respectfully submit that the judgment should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.597" offset="4301720">I would like to reserve any additional time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.064" offset="4503594">There are several points which I would like to elaborate upon to the Court in order to be in proper focus to the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.989" offset="7995329">Well, let me suggest to you, Your Honor -- and I might point out that we were forced to go into the federal court in effect involuntarily because after we sustained our burden before the New York State Division of Human Rights and the appeal board, which entered its decision in August of 1977, immediately thereafter the respondents, on a very questionable appeal as reflected by the absence of any legal or factual discussion by the New York courts on that appeal, was in effect a perfunctory affirmance, immediately thereafter went into the New York State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.117" offset="8143809">Why they had nothing to lose -- no attorney fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.502" offset="8157393">It was at that point in time, almost 90 days after we had involuntarily received our right to sue letter, in which I said we had better go into federal court, file our complaint in case for some reason, which I didn't anticipate, the case was reversed by the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.717" offset="8242239">In other words, it was again the respondent, Ms. Carey, being involuntarily dragged into the state court, as she had been involuntarily dragged, so to speak, into the state proceeding which precipitated the need ultimately for us to go into the federal court to get the relief which we would have automatically been entitled to if we had gone into and permitted to go into the federal court initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.708" offset="8366164">In other words, if we were not in a deferral state, Your Honor -- and you must remember that Congress envisioned a uniform policy throughout this country -- if we weren't in a deferral state, having filed my EEOC complaint on behalf of Ms. Carey, we would have gone after 90 days or 60 days or 180 days, whatever the appropriate time period, into federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.074" offset="8719653">She did it in a deferral forum under the statute, she did not get all of the complete relief to which she was entitled, which is attorneys fees, among other things, for several reasons, and in effect to deny her the leave to go into federal court would penalize her for having enforced the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.128" offset="8811917">It would result in the inequitable result that if she had lost in the State Division of Human Rights and proceeded ahead into federal court and won there, she could have gotten more relief than having won in the State Division of Human Rights.</text>
