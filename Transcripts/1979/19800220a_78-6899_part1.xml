            <label>Mr. J. Calloway Holmes, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="78.185" offset="416162">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.259" offset="436433">This is a death penalty case out of the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.457" offset="453151">I represent Mr. Robert Franklin Godfrey, who was convicted of murder in the first degree in the killings of his wife and her mother, his mother-in-law.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.908" offset="511039">It is here by writ of certiorari from Georgia Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.890" offset="526921">The issue, as framed by this Court in this case, is whether in affirming the death sentence in this case, has the Georgia Supreme Court adopted such a broad and vague construction of Section 27-2534.1(b)(7) as to violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="129.672" offset="622111">Section (b)(7) is one of ten aggravating circumstances that are the statutory guides to jurors in posing the death sentence, the sentencing phase of the Georgia proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.687" offset="698075">Before getting into the merits of the construction of Section (b)(7) by the Georgia Court, I would not want to dwell too long, but I think it would be important to cover the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.581" offset="769651">This defendant, Mr. Godfrey, and his wife, the record shows, had had a stormy marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.996" offset="807372">He had been committed by her on three previous occasions to the state mental hospital in Milledgeville, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.682" offset="858049">They had had a violent argument early in September of 1977, and she had left the house after he had threatened her in a drunken rage.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.976" offset="911235">After about a week, the wife had filed divorce proceedings and had moved in with her mother, who was urging her to go ahead and finally put an end to this marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.165" offset="976018">The defendant had worked for approximately 20 years at the Northwest Regional Hospital as a surgical nurse and a post-operative male nurse.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.923" offset="1035055">He had been to work that day, and his mother-in-law had called him out of the hospital to tell him that his wife wanted to speak to him that evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.249" offset="1080404">The defendant testified that that led him to expect that he was--or to hope that he was going to be able to reconcile the situation as he had been able to do in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.255" offset="1128364">His commitments to the state mental hospital in the past had been voluntary, part of which was the condition for reconciliation with his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.498" offset="1173400">When he got home, his wife did in fact call him.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.700" offset="1190222">They had a rather violent argument, could not reach any kind of agreement on reconciliation or any of the divorce issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.590" offset="1229720">She hung up, told him that she would call back later and see if they could discuss it further.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.373" offset="1252916">He testified that that affected him deeply, that he was put into a very depressed state.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.715" offset="1290219">After the second phone conversation, which was even more heated and she finally hung up on him, he testified at that point that he blanked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.499" offset="1341419">He had had some--whatever history that is in the record--blackouts in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.048" offset="1367542">The record substantiates that he then proceeded to get a shotgun, go down the hill to where the mother-in-law's trailer was, about a hundred, two hundred yards away, came up behind the trailer, fired one shot through the back window, killing his wife instantly, came into the trailer, hit his daughter as she was going out, on the head, causing several stitches, went into the trailer, reloading his shotgun, and shot his mother-in-law in the head as well, creating a very gory scene inside the trailer, which the prosecutor in the case portrayed by color pictures even though he had black and white pictures of the same scenes in his file.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.125" offset="1587911">The petitioner then called the sheriff's office, told them what he had done, told them to come get him.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.157" offset="1619989">They asked him where he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.445" offset="1625109">He explained where he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.293" offset="1632528">He then goes outside the trailer, places the shotgun in the branches of an apple tree, and then sits down under a shade tree to await the arrival of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.653" offset="1689997">When the police get there, he tells them that they are dead, it is all over with, and shows one officer where he has placed the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.582" offset="1737749">He is taken into custody, taken downtown, is in the county police building.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.495" offset="1769305">In the presence of one officer he has allegedly told him that he had done a heinous thing and had thought about it for a long time and would do it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.494" offset="1813400">At the trial Dr. Davis, the psychiatrist from Atlanta with quite impressive credentials, testified in behalf of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.503" offset="1873377">He had seen the defendant twice pursuant to court order, had also treated the defendant back in the '60s in Rome where the defendant worked in the hospital there.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.316" offset="1924681">The second session with Dr. Davis was for the purpose of a sodium anatol interview, truth serum, to aid the psychiatrist in his diagnosis of the mental state and I suppose also to determine the credibility of the defendant's story.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.653" offset="2026036">The psychiatrist concluded that at the time of the second phone call and the blackout of the defendant, that the defendant had been impaled by the immense emotional provocation that he felt about the breakup of his marriage into what he described as a dissociative reaction and admitted on cross-examination that that state is an altered state of consciousness but that the defendant probably would have known right from wrong but would not have been able to consciously control his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.022" offset="2163440">There is a type of psychiatric condition where suppressed feelings are played out in sort of an automatic fashion without real conscious control over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.559" offset="2217566">The state had psychiatric testimony from Milledgeville Hospital, with some--also the records of the defendant's previous incarceration down there.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.937" offset="2279111">All these things you are telling us, Mr. Holmes, were advanced to persuade the jury to a contrary conclusion, I take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.961" offset="2331251">The jury did not accept this defense, did they?</text>

            <text syncTime="561.384" offset="2348910">They did not accept the defense of temporary insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.740" offset="2366360">They were advanced for two purposes, to try to establish the lack of criminal intent and also for purposes of mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.636" offset="2409932">We felt that we were--this was a case that ought to be--ought to get a light sentence, felt that the prosecutor should not have requested the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.847" offset="2462804">But that testimony was really going more to the mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.939" offset="2495091">Our psychiatric witness admitted that it was a non-psychotic condition, and they equated a psychotic condition with insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.379" offset="2548903">So, I think the jury by that concession concluded that there was no real insanity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.712" offset="2598222">When the prosecutor argued during the sentencing phase to the jury, under Section (b)(7), which was the only aggravating circumstance submitted to the jury, which is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.196" offset="2656110">That the offense of murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involves torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim--</text>

            <text syncTime="676.278" offset="2808456">As a matter of fact, there is a case decided at the same time as Godfrey, Holton v. State, in which the Georgia Supreme Court expressed the opinion and dicta that if a circumstance was only composed of depravity of mind, that that would probably be insufficient under the Furman decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1413.038" offset="5755486">In 1973 the General Assembly of Georgia, in response to this Court's decision in Furman, felt that the states could still inflict a death penalty, providing the manner in which they did so set forth certain articulate standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.234" offset="5848273">In March of 1978 a jury in Polk County found that one of these standards had been complied with, based upon the state's case, and imposed the death penalty under the seventh aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.161" offset="5915982">This is a case of premeditated murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.164" offset="5927999">The district attorney on that basis sought the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.257" offset="5980348">While there was an altercation between the petitioner and his wife some three weeks prior to the fatal shootings, that altercation also involved violence, and it also involved a weapon capable of producing death, a knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.946" offset="6047117">On two occasions, on the 5th of September, the petitioner drew a knife on his wife the first time to make her remain seated at a couch in their house, and the second time, actually used that knife on his wife in the bathroom in which he cut her clothes to and through some of her underclothing, although there was no apparent physical injury as a result of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.444" offset="6285145">We need to take into consideration the fact that even though there had been some phone conversations between the petitioner and his wife, there appears to be a sufficient interval, which the jury considered, where there would have been a cooling off of any passions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.936" offset="6347107">The killing takes place at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.877" offset="6358915">The petitioner is able to lurk in the back of this trailer, has the advantage of lights on so that he can silhouette, pick out his target.</text>
