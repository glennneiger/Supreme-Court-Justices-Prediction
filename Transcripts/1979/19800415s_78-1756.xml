            <text syncTime="7.875" offset="31451">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.662" offset="54648">The question presented is whether the General Allotment Act of 1887 authorizes the award of money damages against the United States for alleged mismanagement of forest located on lands allotted to Indians under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.040" offset="128104">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we hold that the Act does not expose the United States to such liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.766" offset="159033">The Act authorizes the President of the United States to allot each Indian residing on a reservation specified acreage of agricultural and grazing land.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.749" offset="202919">Under Section 5 of the Act, the United States retained title to such allotted lands in trust for the benefit of the allottees.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.252" offset="240953">Pursuant to the Act, the Government allotted all of the land in the Quinault Reservation's to individual Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.251" offset="272927">Respondents are individual allottees of land in that reservation, the Quinault tribe which now hold some allotments in unincorporated association of the allottees.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.134" offset="328516">They brought action consolidated in the Court of Claims to recover damages from the Government for alleged mismanagement of timber resources found on the Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.391" offset="373551">The Court of Claims held that Section 5 of the Act holds a fiduciary duty on the Government to manage timber resources properly and constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity against a suit for money damages as compensation for breaches of that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.879" offset="455471">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.893" offset="463517">We hold that the Act created only a limited trust relationship between the United States and the allottee and that does not impose any duty upon the Government to manage timber resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.924" offset="519628">The legislative history of the Act plainly indicates that the trust language of Section 5 was enacted simply to prevent alienation of allotted lands and to ensure that the allottees would be immune from state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.743" offset="594965">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Stevens has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.629" offset="622446">The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case.</text>
