            <text syncTime="20.255" offset="184404">There is no dispute about the facts in this case and we concede essentially that if this Court adheres to its ruling in Hawkins, the judgment below must be reversed because without the spouse's testimony there is nothing in the record to link the petitioner to the conspiracy charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.419" offset="269040">I qualified my concession with the word "essentially" because the Court could decline to hold that the privilege against adverse spouse testimony does not apply where the witness spouse is willing to testify and it could still admit her testimony here for the reasons that she and the petitioner were joint participants in the conspiracy to import heroin as charged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.770" offset="370500">This argument about their being joint conspirators was not presented to the court in Hawkins, nor was it considered by the Court in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.747" offset="414386">We also observe at the outset that the opinion in Hawkins does not foreclose our request that the Court reconsider it, because although the Court said "under these circumstances we are unable to subscribe to the idea that an exclusionary rule based on the persistent instincts of several centuries should now be abandoned, nevertheless," it stated, "as we have already indicated, however, this decision does not foreclose whatever changes in the rule may eventually be dictated by reason and experience."</text>

            <text syncTime="169.574" offset="781667">She had refused to talk with the prosecution or investigators, she is called to the stand when the case is in trial, she could assert the Fifth Amendment, could she not at that stage in this case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="201.633" offset="909876">Well, she could still as we suggest claim the privilege as the witness spouse not to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.696" offset="942164">She could claim it on the basis of preserving marital harmony.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.790" offset="958568">And we do not ask the Court to overturn that, we just say that the privilege should continue but the privilege should be exercised by the witness spouse instead of the defendant spouse, because she is the one more likely by her decision to indicate whether there is anything worth saving.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.741" offset="1050311">We suggest that by placing the privilege in the defendant spouse, he will invariably prevent the witness spouse from testifying, not because of a desire to save the marital harmony but to save his own hide in the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.179" offset="1124080">So we are suggesting that her decision is a reliable indicator of the existence of a marriage whose harmony and felicity should be protected, but to place it with him doesn't serve the underlying purpose of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.372" offset="1208822">That essentially is our argument about the rule enunciated in Hawkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.880" offset="1230869">We say don't destroy the privilege but give it to the witness spouse instead of the defendant spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.823" offset="1270680">As we suggested in our brief -- and I won't dwell on this at any great length -- actually there are two related rules and we are only talking about one of them, and I would like to make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.864" offset="1322820">As the concurring opinion in Hawkins states, there was originally only one rule and it stemmed from two concepts both long since rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.315" offset="1368586">One was the rule that a party, an interested party could not testify in a lawsuit, and the other was the fiction that at law husband and wife were one and, as some persons have said, he was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.881" offset="1422921">And since he could not testify in his own behalf, he could prevent his subordinate alter-ego or his subordinate alter-ego also was incompetent to testify in his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.712" offset="1478196">But after the law evolved to permit interested parties to testify, two rules evolved from this earlier one.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.991" offset="1515290">One is the rule that prevents either spouse from testifying against the other, and that is the rule that Hawkins -- with which Hawkins was concerned, and the other rule, of course, is a rule relating to confidential communications, and neither spouse can be required to reveal a confidential communication and each spouse has a right to prevent the other from doing it, and that rule even survives the demise of a marriage, and we are not talking about that at all here.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.504" offset="1669413">We are talking --</text>

            <text syncTime="393.149" offset="1675995">We are not challenging that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.209" offset="1684250">And we point out, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that in Trammel, in the court below, the court very carefully made this distinction between these two rules, and we are talking about what is sometimes called the anti-marital rule, although the reason for that nomenclature rather escapes me, it is the rule that permits either or both spouses from preventing the other from testifying against him as to matters not confidential communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.899" offset="1823013">And it is our submission that this rule should not permit the defendant spouse to exercise it but should permit the witness spouse to exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.814" offset="1874631">We begin in our argument by pointing out that the public has a right to every person's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.109" offset="1911829">This Court has frequently enunciated that rule and, as has been observed, whenever the public will be deprived of relevant evidence, there should be an overriding consideration to compel such an exception to this general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.678" offset="1990092">And we suggest that there may be, with reference to confidential communications between spouses, we don't touch that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.466" offset="2033246">But we suggest that if the price would be that an offense would not be proved without violating any effort to be confidential between the spouses, that that is too great a price to pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.776" offset="2102523">Mr. Solicitor General, putting aside the confidential communication, would not the logic of your argument equally apply to a claim of privilege by the witness as well as by the defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="512.828" offset="2154663">I'm just wondering if you are writing on a clean slate, wouldn't you ask the Court to abolish the privilege entirely except for the confidential aspects?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="519.392" stopTime="659.366">
            <label>Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="519.392" offset="2180890">MWell, I think I would and many states have.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.563" offset="2193638">As a matter of fact, the mandate of Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures is that the privileges should be based upon principles of the common law as interpreted by the United States courts in the light of experience and reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.996" offset="2263333">I would address first the question of experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.034" offset="2279528">The experience of this country indicates the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.962" offset="2299173">In 1958, when Hawkins was decided, as the concurring opinion states, there were 19 states that permitted inter-spousal testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.466" offset="2353194">Now that number has increased to 27 states, including the District of Columbia, which incidentally did not change but had the rule then.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.697" offset="2390183">Now, a clear majority of the states have no rule that would prevent the Hawkins result, and we think that this tells us something about the experience of the country because these 27 states and the District include some very populous states like New York, Illinois, California, Ohio, and in their totality they include 60 percent of all the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.493" offset="2505331">And if this is their experience, we think this Court could consider it, particularly in the light of the fact that this Court has regarded matters pertaining to the family and to domestic matters as peculiarly within the concern of the states under an appropriate approach to federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.113" offset="2595819">So we think on experience there is a reason to reexamine Hawkins, and we think on the basis of reason there is, as I have suggested, if we want to see whether there is a marriage worth saving, find out whether the witness spouse is willing to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.562" offset="2669589">If it is a good marriage, she is not going to want to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.161" offset="2687979">If it is just a sham, if it is a shell, if it is just a nominal marriage, she is likely to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.662" offset="2726013">But the defendant spouse always will.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.366" offset="2740851">In these 27 states, Mr. Solicitor General, has the rule been altered with respect to both civil and criminal cases or are they --</text>

            <text syncTime="676.315" offset="2808665">We set them forth in the appendix to our brief and some of them relate to civil and others to criminal, but almost invariably they relate to criminal and that is what we are talking about in Hawkins and for that reason I did not pursue it to determine it to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.118" offset="2879822">It is interesting to observe that the District of Columbia has had a rule that allowed a witness spouse to testify against a defendant spouse in a criminal case for more than half a century, and I think that is significant because the Congress has approved the District of Columbia rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.192" offset="3336129">Because here a major drug trafficker is going to go free if we adhere to the rule of Hawkins, without it serving any purpose of promoting marital harmony here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.108" offset="6735809">But you put that on the basis and the rule rests on the basis that that kind of a marriage is pretty well shattered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.624" offset="6773844">When this wife took the stand in the criminal case to testify against her husband, is that marriage any less shattered?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Terry Wiggins</label>
            <text syncTime="1677.633" offset="6813863">By the time that she elected to take the stand in this case to protect herself, I think it is no less shattered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.548" offset="6845524">I think in this case it might easily be said that the marriage were shattered by her choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.468" offset="6873213">It could have had problems prior to that time, but certainly once she took the witness stand, the marriage I would think would have been ruined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.742" offset="6902366">But the question is whether the government should have the opportunity, it seems to me, to try to convince her to destroy the marriage by taking the witness stand so that merely for her own protection the government argues in their brief about the fact that they feel a defendant in almost every case for his own self interest would claim the privilege, and I wouldn't deny that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.323" offset="7004662">But by the same token, Mrs. Trammel in her own self interest, to keep herself out of jail, elected to speak about activities between her husband and anyone else, including everyone involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.207" offset="7056175">I would point out that the co-conspirator exception that the government argues for has a glaring problem in this case that can be seen from the record, and that is how simple it is to accuse someone as an unindicted co-conspirator without actually them having any great involvement in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.262" offset="7144469">I'm not speaking of Elizabeth Trammel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.829" offset="7154709">I am speaking of Ben Richardson, Jr. and Josephine Flewellen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.914" offset="7171009">If you look at the record in this case, you will find that both of those persons were named as unindicted co-conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.738" offset="7194311">Ben Richardson, Jr. did no more than drive Mr. Roberts to the airport, not knowing his reason for going and not knowing what was going to happen when he arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.775" offset="7226493">Josephine Flewellen did no more than ride in an automobile from the airport at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines to the airport so that Mrs. Trammel could get on an airplane to come to the United States, and yet both of those people were named as unindicted co-conspirators simply to get in testimony that may have been available and otherwise would have been unavailable perhaps because of the rules of hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.196" offset="7332133">Mr. Richardson testified at trial, didn't ask for immunity, denied all personal culpability in the case, but he was named as an indicted co-conspirator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.523" offset="7365465">If the same circumstance had taken place where Mrs. Trammel was concerned and she had been permitted to go on and testify simply because the government chose to indict her or name her in the indictment, then the marriage would equally have been destroyed but to no gain for anyone because it would have been clear that she was not a part of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.899" offset="7446967">I'm not arguing that there was not a conspiracy in this case, there certainly was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1885.786" offset="7646542">In that case, both denied and laid it off on the other, but the Eighth Circuit held that the rule prevented the testimony of one against the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.453" offset="7681233">The Cameron case, that the government relies on strongly, out of the Fifth Circuit, a 1977 case, would if this Court adopts what the government argues for, of necessity should have been overruled because Mrs. Cameron said "I don't want to testify against my husband, I'm not involved, I have no desire to testify," and the judge said, "I don't think you have much of a marriage anyway, therefore you will testify."</text>

            <text syncTime="2101.724" offset="8510255">Yes, that is one of my problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.053" offset="8519555">But I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the granting of witness immunity -- I think the Tenth Circuit confused the rights of witness immunity and the privilege considerably because witness immunity I had understood after the Kastigar case was a fairly settled matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.731" offset="8586324">And now to take witness immunity and try to superimpose a husband-wife privilege where the privilege has always been held not in the immunized party but in the other person, both not only confuses the privilege, the husband-wife privilege, but I think confuses immunity, because the Solicitor General argues that there are circumstances where a person could be granted witness immunity and still claim the marital privilege, at least the way the law has been to date.</text>
