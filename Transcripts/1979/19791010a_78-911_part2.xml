            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Mr. Lettow, you may resume.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles F. Lettow</label>
            <text syncTime="16.583" offset="170695">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.486" offset="182293">Regarding both the exposure and the research evidence grounds that the Fifth Circuit had for its decision to set aside the dermal contact prohibition, we have nothing further, really, to add to the points that they put forward in response to the action by OSHA, except for one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.202" offset="265153">In its reply brief in this Court, OSHA makes reference to a 1976 publication by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.980" offset="308308">That's the group that set up the consensus standard that provides the 10 parts per million level that's now in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.422" offset="334117">And it says, in 1976, that ACGIH put forward a skin notation for benzene.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.099" offset="360761">I just want to call the Court's attention to the fact that -- and only because it's in the government's reply brief -- that for two years now, '78 and '79, the ACGIH has no skin notation for benzene.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.390" offset="413947">It's absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.302" offset="417604">They just focus on the airborne hazard.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.120" offset="436830">The one other issue of statutory construction that arises with respect to the research evidence ground is that what is best available evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="94.878" offset="483955">The Court can find a definition for best available evidence fairly easily by just going to Webster's Third New International Dictionary, and that says "available" means that which is accessible or may be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.773" offset="543514">And indeed one of the examples that the dictionary uses for that type of usage is "the latest readily available information".</text>
            <text syncTime="119.549" offset="582593">Now, "readily available" is actually what the Court of Appeals used as it was defining that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.834" offset="603700">And that is fairly easily explained also by what Congress did, because the second and third sentences of 6(b)(5), section 6(b)(5), were actually taken from -- or the terms of them, the words were taken from the research provisions of the bill that was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.417" offset="670051">The research provisions were there first.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.819" offset="679664">And the research provisions in section 20(a), especially 20(a) (3), make a reference to research, demonstrations, and experiments.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.914" offset="716027">That's where that language comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.341" offset="721774">So they knew what they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.019" offset="728461">They knew that OSHA had to do some research in order to be able to come up with standards under some instances.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.941" offset="752180">Earlier in your argument, Mr. Lettow, you suggested that if this standard prevails, that the tire industry just won't make the grade, that it will shut down.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.344" offset="885823">The issue of feasibility is one that we have argued strongly in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.647" offset="907034">But because they didn't decide it, they said that was the issue that was most affected by the amendment to the standard that came at the eve of oral argument, literally on the eve, the afternoon before.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.400" offset="946009">We argued that issue in supplemental brief to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.519" offset="962518">But because it didn't decide it, it hasn't been briefed here.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.557" offset="1150600">Well, Mr. Justice White, the Secretary, that is OSHA, does make a reference to the fact that in the tire industry you need skin contact, you need dermal contact with solvents.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.485" offset="1202322">They have put forward, and the basis for the feasibility claim is now based on the percentage exclusion to the standard, whether or not that's sufficient in terms of these solvents.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.387" offset="1249970">That is what is actually briefed.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="287.798" offset="1255612">Well, if the feasibility issue would have to be remanded, would it be remanded to the Court of Appeals or to OSHA?</text>

            <text syncTime="295.402" offset="1286019">Your Honor, I honestly don't think that it ever left the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.286" offset="1301588">When you granted certiorari you didn't get to that issue, and I guess the question you would have in your action in this Court is whether or not you would agree with the Fifth Circuit on the two grounds they adopted, if you did or did not it would go back to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.095" offset="1368775">If the Fifth Circuit had -- well, the Fifth Circuit would decide the feasibility question and then it would or would not go back to OSHA.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.758" offset="1387478">Well, if you were right and it was not feasible, and that meant the standard was not valid, it would certainly save us an awful lot of work.</text>
