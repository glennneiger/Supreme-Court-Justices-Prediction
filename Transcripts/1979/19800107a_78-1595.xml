            <text syncTime="98.469" offset="497246">They charged him with a violation of Section 1202 of 18 U.S.C. App. that is the possession of a firearm having previously been convicted of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.912" offset="551058">The case came on before the United States District Court in Richmond without a jury, on the morning of trial, counsel in a motion in a context of a motion for a continuance pointed out to the Court in a proffer that the conviction which formed the basis for the indictment had been obtained in counsel's judgment in violation and pure violation of Gideon against Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.936" offset="667146">Counsel told the Court that he had called a lawyer in Florida that had been kind enough to check the records and that the records of the Florida court, the records on the day of trial showed affirmatively that Lewis had no lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.667" offset="734020">Collaterally, the -- was also represented to the Court that the indictment possibly was defective although that that issue was not pursued in view of the trial court's ruling on Gideon.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.872" offset="2098866">One has his constitutional guarantees for example to a speedy trial which will remove it in a short time and the use of the word indictment certainly is unequivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.211" offset="2156231">May it please the Court, in constructing the statute I would argue that it is not necessary to reach the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.368" offset="2204818">The Government I think, the trust to the Government's argument has been and seems to be that if Congress had meant to exclude Lewis from the scope of the statute that is to exclude people who've been convicted in violation of Gideon that it would have spelled it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.428" offset="2293112">I think the reverse really is true I think that had Congress with its awareness of Gideon had meant to include people like Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.666" offset="2326026">I think it's just as logical to say that they would have spelled that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.498" offset="2341386">I'm told that -- for example, after this Court's decision in Miranda and some other cases, there was considerable congressional discussion about certain cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.109" offset="2383809">And of course I don't believe there's ever been any great congressional stir over the Court's ruling in Gideon so that certainly they were aware of Gideon.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.838" offset="2490702">Likewise, we are dealing with a penal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.743" offset="4082395">I would like to, if it please the Court, to touch on some more aspects of the constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.002" offset="4107368">As -- as I said, I believe throughout the case in my brief, I think the -- the issue before you boils down to an interpretation of three cases chiefly Burgett, Loper and Tucker, and analyzing each of the three, I come not only within the majority opinions but I believe that I am safe on the dissents as -- as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.492" offset="4205380">I know again, Mr. Chief Justice, that some members of the Court were concerned because in Loper and in Tucker, you -- you were speaking not only or not of a prospective application of Gideon but you were talking about a retrospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.311" offset="4276642">That is, these trials where the evidence was introduced of the Gideon violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.739" offset="4294301">These trials have taken place long before Gideon was ever decided and at the time they were introduced, this is the case, I believe, in Tucker, the -- or in Loper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.270" offset="4328469">The trial judge rule correctly was law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.385" offset="4340903">That is not the case here, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.575" offset="4349680">Lewis' trial in -- in Richmond a couple of years ago, the law of the land was Gideon and he had been clearly convicted in -- in violation of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.907" offset="4390954">So I believe I have excluded that portion of the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.944" offset="4415195">I find it impossible or difficult as Judge Winter did to make any meaningful distinction between this case and Burgett against Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.851" offset="4450826">I had thought that the Court had made it clear that a conviction obtained in violation of Gideon was useless to any purpose due to enhanced punishment or to establish guilt, and both were done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.557" offset="4509550">That is -- he gets 18 months to serve for -- by reason of this conviction so he's got an enhanced punishment and it was used as a predicate for the conviction itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.649" offset="4562004">That is the -- the whole basis for it was this conviction in violation of Gideon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.563" offset="4605576">I would, Mr. Chief Justice ask the balance of my time be reserved for whatever rebuttal I had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.643" offset="4625951">Finally, I had one thing that I -- I think I've made clear but it's worth repeating and that is, the Government and I apparently differ on the phraseology of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.668" offset="4658030">I phrased it so in the petition that whether one convicted in violation of Gideon against Wainwright could defend a firearms charge on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.679" offset="4694079">The Government has a more sweeping phraseology and they had throughout their brief referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.716" offset="4718216">It has made one attack to the constitutionality.</text>

            <text syncTime="1205.327" offset="4924688">In response to Mr. Justice Blackmun's and Mr. Justice Stewart's inquiries, I think, that the Government has conceded for the purposes of the proceedings here that the petitioner has alleged that his conviction was invalid under Gideon against Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.149" offset="4995950">If the Court accepts either petitioner's statutory or constitutional claim and objects the Government's arguments then the appropriate remedy, I think, both petitioner and respondent agree would be remand to the District Court for determination of whether or not in fact the prior conviction was void under Gideon against Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.890" offset="5086960">As I understand his proffer, the record of the conviction does not affirmatively show that the -- that the petitioner did not have counsel at -- at the time of his 1961 conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.048" offset="5135548">Rather the -- I believe that the Florida lawyer indicated to Mr. Wood that the record or transcript of -- of the proceedings did indicate that he was without counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.016" offset="5291447">We've never had an opportunity to explore that as a matter of proceedings because the District Court and Court of Appeals correctly in our view said that whether or not he was without to counsel at his 1961 conviction is irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.657" offset="5470020">And the judge said, "Well, there's no need for a continuance because it's irrelevant," which is our point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.372" offset="5504815">And he started to say -- petitioner was convicted in 1961 in a Florida state court of a felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.520" offset="5553403">Nonetheless, he claims that the Act should be construed to permit him to attack the validity of his prior conviction for the first time in his federal gun law prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.076" offset="5591646">Alternatively, he claims that if the Act does not provide such a defense that the Constitution requires it at least where it is alleged that the prior conviction was obtained in violation of the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.204" offset="5636159">In our view, the language and structure of the Act refutes petitioner's statutory claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.697" offset="6114200">And then, proceed to purchase the firearm in which he could recite that there was no valid conviction outstanding against him or words to that effect.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="1515.164" offset="6164041">That's absolutely correct Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.181" offset="6172087">I will point out a couple of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.360" offset="6176789">First, of course in this case the petitioner was not going to become a guard at an institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.884" offset="6206882">He was arrested for having a concealed weapon on his person as he was about to enter an illegal gambling casino.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.201" offset="6240214">I would further point out that the Act gives the defendant who was been convicted and think he's either being convicted unfairly or who thinks that his conviction is not indicative of his propensity to misuse firearms, three alternatives before going out and possessing the firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.976" offset="6307297">First, he can collaterally attack his conviction in the appropriate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.211" offset="6324224">Here, he should have gone back to Florida state court where they are familiar with Florida law and Florida proceedings and Florida records and not raise it for the first time in a federal court after going out in possessing the firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.721" offset="6366229">Second, he could obtain a qualifying pardon under Section 1203 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.812" offset="6386604">The pardon must state specifically, not only that his pardoned but that he's pardoned and can use firearms or can posses firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.285" offset="6416488">Third, failing -- the ability to overturn the conviction for one reason or another or get a pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.088" offset="6439685">The convicted person has the alternative under Section 925 (c) of the Act to petition the Secretary of Treasury for dispensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.617" offset="6473853">This is not a meaningless procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.366" offset="6480854">In the year 1978, some 1700 and 54 applications were made by convicted felons for dispensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.789" offset="6510529">And of those, something like 574 were actually granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.653" offset="6529964">And so, this is a real procedure which is followed by many people who are apprehensive about their prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.779" offset="6562461">Now -- so far, there's no exception in the Act, there's no defense in the Act regarding the validity of the prior conviction and such a defense would similarly be reconcilable with Congress' decision to impose a similar firearm disability on persons under indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.942" offset="6635186">If -- if a person -- if petitioner is correct by the statutory construction of the Act then he would attribute to Congress the following purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.226" offset="6668309">The person who was convicted, albeit without counsel, obviously has already been indicted yet even though he was indicted and a jury or judge has found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt albeit without counsel, he would be deemed more trustworthy than a person who's merely under indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.969" offset="6735287">Yet, a person whose conviction is overturned for lack of counsel is not scot-free, he is still under indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.255" offset="6768410">It's simply irreconcilable with -- with the congressional language to the construe the Act to permit a validity defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.308" offset="6844583">Well, the -- that there's a lot more discussion about the parallel provisions in Section 922 and those were enacted the same time and use the exact same language, has been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.630" offset="6889932">And the legislative history as a whole shows a -- a clear congressional purpose to broadly reach out as this Court has recognized in Scarborough, in Barrett, in Huddleston, and in Bass, a broad purpose of Congress to limit the flow of firearms to persons who might potentially be dangerous to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.676" offset="6970075">And certainly, petitioner fits into that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.424" offset="6989093">And it's particularly reflective of congressional intent that there is no specific validity defense because first all, there are exceptions and defenses contained within the Act, express ones but not -- not the one sought by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.430" offset="7045099">Moreover, where Congress has thought it appropriate to allow defendants to challenge prior convictions it has so provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.775" offset="7078431">For example, in the special dangerous offender statute which is found at 18 U.S.C. 3575 (e), Congress has specifically provided the defense sought by petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.032" offset="7123466">Interestingly -- and not provide in this Act, interestingly, the special dangers offender statute was enacted as Title X of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.155" offset="7167979">Title XI of that very same Act is an explosive control statute which in haec verba adopts the gun control provisions and yet in that Title XI, no special defense is made, the defense of the -- a validity that is sought by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.412" offset="7241017">So it's therefore clear that Congress knows how to create such a -- a defense or exception when it wants to and it purposely did not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.928" offset="7271111">And that's quite understandable given the general thrust of the Act which is that persons who by their prior acts or characteristics have indicated they might be dangerous, should clear their name first before going out in possessing a firearm, it's a clear bright line rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.297" offset="7340596">Petitioner's construction of the Act would encourage defendants and people who have been convicted to simply guess whether or not they think that their prior conviction is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.376" offset="7372884">That would certainly narrow the ambit of the Act and would also tend to defeat the purpose of Congress, which was to make sure that people who are running around with firearms or getting firearms are to be trusted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2769.772" offset="11182477">That's in any way -- I'm aware of no federal persecution for someone who has possessed or received a firearm after the time that their conviction was overturned and that is the policy that the Government follows with regards to this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.058" offset="11231587">I started to try to distinguish Burgett and that line of cases and I first -- at the first distinction, is the distinction that this Court drew in Loper itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.365" offset="11264815">In a footnote in the majority opinion in that case, the Court distinguished between two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.952" offset="11283205">First of all there is a -- what was not good in that case, was the use of an uncounseled conviction to impeach a defendant's testimony generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.661" offset="11326046">However the Court's suggested a different result would be reached if on direct testimony the defendant got up and said, “I've never been convicted” simply ignoring the fact of his prior conviction albeit uncounseled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.252" offset="11372335">In that case he would just be for ignoring the historical fact of his conviction as opposed to its -- the general impeachment where the reliability of the conviction is critical to its impeachment value and here we say the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.577" offset="11429700">The reliability of the individual conviction with regard to the defendant's propensity to misuse firearm is only relevant in two aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.771" offset="11474422">First, in the administrator proceeding before the Secretary of Treasury and also that the general groups of persons who have been convicted are more likely to misuse firearms than the populace at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.179" offset="11528129">However, in the criminal trial itself is only the historical fact of conviction which is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.479" offset="11557282">The second distinction I would draw between the Burgett line of cases and this case is that Congress has simply provided a timing differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.188" offset="11596152">The defendant who was personally been convicted must go out and clear his name prior to obtaining the firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.367" offset="11628857">And the civil disability which is imposed by the statute attaches immediately upon conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.795" offset="11654562">The criminal penalty is imposed when he simply ignores the civil disability and ignores the administrative procedures set up by Congress or judicial proceures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.799" offset="11698552">In Burgett and in Loper and in Tucker, the first time that the prior conviction allegedly uncounseled convictions in those cases became relevant was that the criminal proceeding itself, not immediately upon the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.923" offset="11747035">And therefore it was appropriate to allow the defendants in those cases to challenge the validity of their prior convictions at the criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.896" offset="11782980">Here, petitioner eschewed his right to challenge those -- his prior conviction at an earlier stage which Congress recommended him to do so and for failing to do that, Congress has imposed a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.016" offset="11835434">If counsel's interpretation of the Burgett line of cases and the Sixth Amendment is correct, it would lead us to conclusion that a person who is convicted albeit without counsel and is in jail could escape from jail without any kind of penalty being attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.428" offset="11897083">You could only ignore the fact of his conviction and walk-out tomorrow because under his theory there's no -- it's as if there is no such thing as the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.385" offset="11928952">And I don't think that's what Congress or this Court meant in those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.002" offset="12303339">The appendix will show that the -- after the Government had rested its case-in-chief, and I -- I believe called Mr. Lewis to the stand to testify on other matters, we made the proffer again and that as we told the judge that in view of his earlier ruling that the evidence of the Gideon violation would not be received that we would not go into that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.027" offset="12403440">Of course it's conceivable that we could've gone forward even without any records and had the man testified to it, he may have been believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.857" offset="12434787">But in view of the judge's earlier ruling he held that that would not be necessary to present that such proof.</text>
