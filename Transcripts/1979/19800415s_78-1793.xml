            <text syncTime="6.803" offset="27167">This is a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.677" offset="34691">It comes to us on certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.324" offset="61231">The question is whether the defendant's failure to cooperate with law enforcement authorities was a proper factor for consideration in determining his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.342" offset="105326">The Court of Appeals held that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.289" offset="117133">The petitioner confessed involvement in a heroin conspiracy, but he refused to identify the others who had participated in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.176" offset="160601">The District Court imposed a heavy sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.147" offset="172513">It explained that petitioner was a dealer that he was given the opportunity but failed to cooperate with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.114" offset="216398">Petitioner's unwillingness to assist law enforcement suggested the possibility of an intention to return to dealing in narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.200" offset="256731">It also suggested that petitioner would not respond affirmatively to rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.068" offset="284212">Petitioner offered no explanation for his declining to cooperate nor did petitioner claim that his silence was an exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.053" offset="348160">As he failed to invoke the privilege at a time when its legitimacy could be determined, he waived his right to claim it on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.676" offset="386612">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.424" offset="401659">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a concurring opinion and Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
