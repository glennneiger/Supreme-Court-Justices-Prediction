            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.325" offset="37198">This case comes to us from the California Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.194" offset="52767">California has a resale price maintenance statute for wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.843" offset="75337">Under this statute a wine producer may set prices through a fair trade contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.808" offset="99161">If this is not done, wholesalers must post a resale price schedule for that producer's brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.331" offset="133224">Wine merchants are required to sell to retailers only at prices established in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.478" offset="161855">Respondent charged with violating established prices successfully challenged the California system as violative of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.723" offset="202815">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.270" offset="213055">The California statute was defended in this Court on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.341" offset="229355">First, that its program is immune from federal antirust laws under the state action exception, an exception this Court created in Parker against Brown decided in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.975" offset="287869">Secondly, it was argued that the Twenty-first Amendment that repealed the prohibition amendment authorized the states to regulate traffic in liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.486" offset="329874">For reasons stated in the Court's opinion, we reject both of these arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.995" offset="351922">Neither the state action doctrine of Parker against Brown nor the Twenty-first Amendment authorizes a state to delegate the private parties the right to fix prices in a manner that would violate federal antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.690" offset="414720">We therefore affirmed the judgment of the California Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.011" offset="431961">Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
