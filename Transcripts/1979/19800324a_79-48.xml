            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="15.989" offset="167372">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.270" offset="180433">This case is here on the government's petition to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.417" offset="201017">The focal point of this case is the so-called Buy Indian Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.974" offset="215228">The act itself is quite brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.159" offset="224005">It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior insofar as may be practicable to employ Indian labor and to make purchases of Indian industry in the open market.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.154" offset="264025">The Secretary has delegated his authority under the act to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau in turn has promulgated a detailed policy statement concerning Buy Indian contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.877" offset="306866">The Buy Indian program is fairly narrow in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.247" offset="320345">It pertains only to BIA procurement and that by definition pertains to the welfare of Indians, Indian tribes and Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.177" offset="364126">The policy statement directs the local BIA contracting officer where practicable to first ascertain that there is a qualified 100 percent Indian owned contractor capable of filling the contracting need.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.717" offset="430268">If there is more than one such firm in the normal competitive area, whatever the contracting need is, then the BIA officer is directed to arrange competitive bidding among the various Indian firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.907" offset="483035">If there is only one such qualified firm, then the BIA officer is authorized to negotiate a contract with that firm at a fair and reasonable price.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.409" offset="520965">And if there is no such qualified firm or if no firm is willing to fulfill the contracting need at a fair and reasonable price, then BIA turns the contract over to open competitive bidding.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="118.151" offset="575927">Mr. Levander, are you going to cover the chronology of the statutes and the regulations some time in your argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="128.908" offset="618977">Now, the controversy in this case centers on a five-mile stretch of Indian logging road that cuts through Indian trust lands in Pushmataha County, Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.203" offset="664221">In 1977, in accordance with the BIA program I just described, the BIA contacted three qualified Indian firms in the normal competitive area and asked each to submit a bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.788" offset="718555">The respondent, which is a non-Indian corporation, was not asked to bid and subsequently the contract was awarded to Indian Nations Construction Company, a company wholly owned by three Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.014" offset="767457">The price that it was awarded at was considered to be fair and reasonable both by BIA and the National Highway Administration.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="172.722" offset="794311">When did the Secretary first start construing the Buy Indian Act to cover construction of roads?</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="181.163" stopTime="240.402">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="181.163" offset="828061">I think that as we detailed in our brief that the earlier reports -- the Buy Indian Act itself was enacted in 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.083" offset="863692">However, suitable language appeared in a series of appropriations acts between 1884 and 1908, almost identical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.205" offset="900159">And the temporary administrative reports, that is reports that were required by Congress to be filed by the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reflected all during this period, including 1910 and thereafter, that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary considered the Buy Indian Act and the preference contained in the act to apply not only to goods, as respondent argues, but also construction of all kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.396" offset="1004962">For example, the 1908 appropriations act specifically expressly applied the preference to irrigation construction and a road on the Hooper Valley Indian Reservation and it --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="240.402" offset="1064939">That was before the Buy Indian Act was even enacted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="243.348" stopTime="312.508">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="243.348" offset="1076746">There was a predecessor act which has the same language and therefore should be construed similarly, and in 1910 when the act was enacted the legislative history and again the contemporary administrative reports show that Congress intended the act to apply to construction as well as to goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.749" offset="1170369">The 1910, 1911, 1912 reports all show that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior considered it their duty to employ Indians and to hire Indian teams, which are the sort of forerunners of today's modern corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.285" offset="1232541">Certainly at that time Indians didn't have corporations, but they did have entrepreneurs who had teams.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.458" offset="1253230">And Rep. Sherman's statement, which is quoted at page 23 of our brief, I believe, and a subsequent comment in 1910 by Rep. Burke all show that they expected the act to be applied to irrigation construction, and I don't think that for the purposes of this case that you can distinguish meaningfully between irrigation construction and road construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.559" offset="1341628">It is still construction.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="312.508" offset="1353435">Did the Bureau or the Secretary ever construe it as not to apply to construction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="318.396" stopTime="379.605">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="318.396" offset="1376946">No, they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.012" offset="1383424">It has been a consistent interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.358" offset="1396799">The language of the act is certainly broad enough to encompass construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.739" offset="1418324">The word "product" as defined by the dictionary encompasses anything that human effort produces or creates, and that certainly includes road construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.744" offset="1466389">An example of a very common usage of the word "product" to include construction is the gross national product.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.658" offset="1490004">That includes goods, services, and construction work in the nation in a particular year, and that is a very common usage going back for quite some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.131" offset="1523858">So the word "product" doesn't take any strain of the imagination, as the Court of Appeals suggested, to construe the word "product" to encompass construction work.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.680" offset="1566072">And we think that Congress' intent, and the consistent administrative interpretation should have been deferred to by the Court of Appeals as reflected in the legislative history and those --</text>

            <text syncTime="409.803" offset="1742555">Doesn't that convey a message that products of industries in which Indians typically engage?</text>

            <text syncTime="416.174" offset="1768051">And the respondent concedes that the Buy Indian Act would apply to an Indian corporation today that produced electronic computers, and you would not think of that as a typical product.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.497" offset="1813400">In fact, both the legislative history and the administrative reports show quite clearly that there was an anticipation that Indians would engage in all kinds of modern industry, and there was a whole -- by use of preference legislation like the Buy Indian Act, that in fact Indians could finally rid themselves of dependence and that they would eventually become self-sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.743" offset="1922382">For example, in the 1911 report, the annual report of the Secretary, he states, "Indians all over the country are entering gradually into ordinary industrial activities," indicating that there was a hope and an anticipation and recognition that the Buy Indian Act would apply to these kinds of activities and that --</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="603.781" offset="2518497">That's right, but as soon as it got started -- I mean I'm not sure what that -- in any event, we think that the construction of the words "products of Indian Industry" should be given a liberal construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.400" offset="2572936">It is not only supported by the legislative history and what we consider to be a consistent and long-standing administrative practice, but also by two very important policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.151" offset="2615986">First of all, this Court has reiterated over and over again in cases such as in the last term Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe and Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States and other cases, that when you are construing a statute that has been passed on behalf of Indians, that you must give every reasonable and possible inference to the benefit of the Indians, and certainly the word "product" is easily stretched or easily encompasses the word "construction" and it doesn't take much imagination to get it to road construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.270" offset="2760495">Furthermore, the second policy consideration is that the Buy Indian Act is very important, it is not a theoretical benefit to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.528" offset="2797484">As we detailed in our brief and as also detailed in the brief of the amicus curiae in this case, the impact of the decisions below has been severe on Indian industry, especially in the field of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.040" offset="2851506">It takes a fair amount of know-how, money and expertise to get into complicated Industries like electronic computers.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.049" offset="2883584">That is not true of the construction industry, although there obviously is some expertise needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.470" offset="2901243">But there is a lot of labor needed and that kind of an industry can be started up much more easily.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.763" offset="2922454">In many reservations, the construction industry or logging industry are the most important employers and source of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.028" offset="2963519">The effect of the decisions below has been to cut off in large part Buy Indian contracting, as a result of which several Indian firms have actually gone bankrupt and there is loss of employment and economic dislocation among the group who has been recognized by this Court and Congress over and over again as terribly disadvantaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.032" offset="3047528">The second issue in the case, assuming that the Court agrees with us that products of Indian industry includes road construction, is whether the Federal Property Act, what I referred to FPASA in our brief, impliedly revealed the Buy Indian preference in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.470" offset="3133210">Now, respondent concedes that the Buy Indian Act was initially passed not only as a preference for Indians but also as an exception to the general federal advertising requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.533" offset="3181484">He also acknowledges that it continues to be an exception even in 1980 for the purchase of electronic computers.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.780" offset="3214503">His sole claim is that section 302(e)(B), which appears I think at page 41 of our brief -- on 42 actually -- impliedly repeals the Buy Indian preference as regards major construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.440" offset="3289109">Now, before turning to the act itself, I think that this Court's unanimous decision in Morton v. Mancari is very instructive on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.762" offset="3334457">In that case, the question was whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act had impliedly repealed a long-standing Indian preference, and this Court said in the absence of affirmative indications that Congress intended to repeal the long-standing preference, the Court would not construe the two acts -- the Court would give each act force and would not find implied repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.659" offset="3429961">Now, even if the act was not as explicit as it is -- and I will get to that in a moment -- about preserving prior exceptions to the advertising statutes, Morton v. Mancari, it seems to me, indicates quite strongly that the Court should be wary of finding implied repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.890" offset="3510941">There is nothing in the legislative history or language of the 1965 act which refers to the Buy Indian Act, so if it repealed it, it repealed it implicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.761" offset="3546467">Now, three separate sections of the Federal Property Act expressly state that there is an intent to preserve prior existing exceptions to the general advertising statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.704" offset="3598190">The Buy Indian Act was not only express exception to what was then called Revised Statute 3709, that is, the original federal advertising statute, but it also talks about purchases in the open market which was a well understood phrase in contrast to advertised bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.737" offset="3666317">So there is no doubt, and respondent concedes that this was a well established exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.432" offset="3689096">Section 310 of the Federal Property Act, which is printed on page 41 of the brief, specifically states that any statute which was a prior exception to Revised Statute 3709 -- which was then codified at 41 U.S.C. 5 -- is also to be considered an exception to the Federal Property Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.381" offset="3764851">The respondent concedes that the Buy Indian Act falls within Section 310, and it seems to me that now this is a case that is a fortiori after Morton v. Mancari since the act specifically says it is to preserve the preexisting exceptions and that it should not be -- no change is made in those exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.862" offset="3862862">Section 310 further states that the act shall be considered to be an exception under section (c)(15), 302(c)(15) of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.926" offset="3915107">Now, section 302(c) says basically you must advertise except for the following 15 exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.201" offset="3940185">The first 14 exceptions --</text>

            <text syncTime="986.800" offset="4050526">Section 310 of the act, as I said, preserves all exceptions and directs you to (c)(15).</text>
            <text syncTime="992.931" offset="4075081">Now, the first 14 exceptions of subsection (c), 302(c) are exceptions to the advertising rules created by subsection (c), that is they don't depend on other acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.467" offset="4121266">They are exceptions created by the act, that is for things like impractability and emergencies and exigencies and national emergencies and professional kinds of things, experimental research and a number of them, and they are all created by the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.756" offset="4186363">(c)(15) merely recognizes exceptions created by other law, as otherwise provided by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.284" offset="4220531">Now, the respondent agrees again that we are in (c)(15) and as to non-construction work the binding act constitutes an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.715" offset="4262222">He turns to 302 (e)(B), however, and says, ha, 302(B) says that of the exceptions created by the Federal Property Act, seven are listed and (15) is not one of them and therefore (15) obviously was not intended to apply to major construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.983" offset="4339336">But (e)(B) states that this section shall not be construed to authorize, if there is nothing about what other sections or other statutes authorize, and it is simply a way of differentiating among the 14 exceptions created by the statute itself and does not have any effect or impact upon an authorization or an exemption created by other law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.192" offset="7392110">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.923" offset="7411022">Glover Construction Company's position is that five miles of roadway costing $1.2 million and located in Pushmataha County, Oklahoma is not a product for sale on the open market and it is not Indian supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.943" offset="7495137">We believe that such a project is a roadway construction within the meaning of the Federal Property Act and as such is subject to the competitive bidding requirements of that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.524" offset="7545501">The government's main thrust has been that the word "products" as used in the Buy Indian Act should be broadly and liberally defined to include roadway construction because of the policy of resolving doubtful expressions in favor of the Indian people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.155" offset="7623973">We are aware that this Court has on several occasions announced that policy; however, we believe that policy has no application to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.542" offset="7673501">Based on the facts that were developed in the District Court, those facts show that the Indian community in general does not benefit from the BIA's interpretation of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.604" offset="7737762">The facts that were developed in the District Court show that the beneficiaries of this interpretation were the owners of Indian Nations Construction Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.449" offset="7777155">The president of that company is a one-fourth degree Indian who is an administrative law judge for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare by occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.646" offset="7817906">The vice president of that company was a one-quarter blood Choctaw who is a self-employed rancher and who states his net worth at just under a half million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.614" offset="7865866">The treasurer and general manager of that corporation is a non-Indian and he states his net worth at $1.3 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.824" offset="7910693">Now, based on the reports that we have seen from the American Indian Policy Review Commission, the Indians are desperately in need of roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.010" offset="7947368">The report indicates that the roadway systems are about 40 percent inadequate, that they don't have enough money budgeted to build enough roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.167" offset="7984044">Basically, the crux of the report is that they need more roads than there is money to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.448" offset="8009122">Now, what is important about that is that in 1976 Glover Construction Company built the first five miles of this road for $538,000, and for less than what the engineer estimated the cost would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.742" offset="8082369">The second five miles of this same road in 1977 cost $1.2 million without competitive bidding and was 22 percent above the estimate that the engineers said it would cost to build it.</text>

            <label>Mr. D. D. Hayes</label>
            <text syncTime="2011.950" offset="8151124">I agree, Your Honor, it was quite different, but I think the significant point is that we built it for less than the BIA's engineer estimated it would cost, and also its specifications were changed, they built it for -- they let a contract to build it for 22 percent more than what it was estimated it would cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.800" offset="8242552">Based on these reasons, and another reason that we think it doesn't benefit the Indians is there is absolutely not one shred of evidence in the record, not one shred of credible evidence that any Indian workmen are employed on this $1.2 million project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.681" offset="8330115">Now, we don't think it benefits the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.679" offset="8338056">We don't think it gets them enough road built, we think it is more expensive and we don't think it is creating any jobs under this interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.507" offset="8369403">Now, we think that the usual methods of interpreting and construing statutes ought to be applied to case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.809" offset="8406601">We think it should be remembered that the Buy Indian Act was simply a proviso to section 23 of the Act June 25, 1910 and that section 23 was a remedial statute, and the obvious purpose of passing this remedial statute was to correct intolerable abuses in purchasing and contracting within the Indian Service which was the predecessor to the BIA, and this is made clear from Rep. Burke's remarks where he says that at that time the Indian Service was interpreting the 1908 act to permit them to engage in virtually unregulated purchases and that this was resulting in indefensible abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.281" offset="8596459">So they passed this statute to remedy that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.067" offset="8615685">I don't think there is any question but that the rule that this Court has previously announced and previously followed is that remedial statutes ought to be interpreted to achieve the remedy that the Congress prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.733" offset="8670333">Applying that rule to this case, that statute ought to be interpreted liberally to correct the defect and to promote competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.316" offset="8708681">Now, we also think it is significant that the Buy Indian Act was a proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.004" offset="8735431">It is almost uniformly held that a proviso should be strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.917" offset="8759045">It is almost uniformly held that the proviso should be construed in light of the enacting clause of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.206" offset="8788198">It is almost uniformly held that the national limitation of the proviso is to those things previously mentioned in the enacting clause and that no case is taken out of the enacting clause unless it falls fairly or plainly within the terms of the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.264" offset="8852459">Now, to interpret the word "products" to include roadway construction I think it would be necessary to violate or disregard every one of these usual rules of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.375" offset="8912854">We have to forget that the purpose of the enacting clause in this statute was to require competitive bidding on Indian supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.185" offset="8952142">Likewise, we have to liberally construe the proviso, instead of strictly construe it, and the lower courts said that you couldn't even get there with a liberal interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.378" offset="9000835">You also have to forget the subject matter that Congress was regulating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.365" offset="9016822">Congress was regulating Indian supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.915" offset="9031032">They were not regulating construction projects, and we think it is very clear that the kind of Indian supplies that was exempt from competitive bidding are products of Indian industry, that they weren't talking about --</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.364" offset="9200828">Yes, we believe that this is covered by the Federal Property Act and that it is a contract for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.177" offset="9224129">But what I am speaking of just now is the original act of 1910 where what they were talking about and the only thing they mention in the enacting clause was Indian supplies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.444" offset="9277106">That was in the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.859" offset="9282853">They mentioned Indian labor in the proviso, but in the enacting clause I believe the only thing they mentioned is Indian supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.553" offset="9309602">At any rate, you are absolutely correct, they do mention Indian labor in the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.792" offset="9342516">We think that it is also apparent that this act of 1910 was not designed to cover roadway construction by comparing this act with the act that it was designed to repeal, which is the Act of April 30, 1908.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.464" offset="9413256">And the important thing to note in the Act of April 30, 1908 is that that act contains standard construction-type language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.587" offset="9445752">The language in the pertinent part read that hereafter supplies may be purchased, contracts let and labor employed for the construction of artesian wells, ditches, and other work's of irrigation, and then they go on to say without advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.999" offset="9503326">Now, that is the act of 1908, and then Congress comes along two years later and passes this act for the express purpose of repealing that act and they deleted the language that I just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.536" offset="9561527">And we think the rule is that when Congress passes a revising statute in the place of an original statute and they leave out a provision from the original statute, they intended to repeal that provision and make it annulled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.318" offset="9628609">And in order to apply this statute, the Act of 1910 to roadway construction, I think you have to rewrite the statute to put that language back into it, and I don't think that is what Congress wanted done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.375" offset="9696841">At any rate, we believe that the Court is confronted with a very clear-cut choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.814" offset="9726621">You can define the word "products" by looking at a dictionary definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2484.174" offset="10040090">My client built one in 1976 by competitive bidding, and we believe -- and the evidence isn't clear on this point, but we believe that from 1935 to 1971, they had to be building these roads by competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.994" offset="10123368">And we also believe that the Court should give great weight to the interpretation of the BIA when they first commenced the road building program in 1935, because that is the point closer in time.</text>
