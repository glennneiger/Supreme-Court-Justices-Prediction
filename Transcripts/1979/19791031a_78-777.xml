            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="110.525" offset="545520">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.963" offset="563179">This case began on January 3, 1974 when Carol Owens, a student visiting Washington, DC for a brief course of study was robbed at gunpoint and sexually molested by the respondent in a stall at the women’s restroom near the Washington Monument.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.208" offset="640188">During the course of what must have been a most harrowing experience, Owens had an extended opportunity to observe her assailant at close range.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.027" offset="679476">She promptly reported the crime to the police and provided them with the description of the robber.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.500" offset="705390">Three days later, two other women were robbed under somewhat similar circumstances in the same rest room and they too gave the police a description of their assailant, which generally correspondent with the description given by Owens.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.146" offset="771950">Subsequently on January 9th, two Park policemen on duty at the monument grounds spotted respondent who appeared to them to fit the description given by the robbery victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.945" offset="823150">They approached him and during a brief conversation were told that his name was Keith Crews that he had walked away from school, but he was 16 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.026" offset="867453">After respondent went into the men’s room, the officers conversed with the tour guide who told him that he believe respondent had been at the Monument grounds on the day of the Owens robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.018" offset="911444">On the basis of this additional information, the officers detained respondent and called for the assistance of the detective who was investigating the robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.606" offset="949791">He arrived shortly and attempted to take a photograph of respondent, but was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.358" offset="980825">He thereupon ordered that the respondent be taken to the nearby Park Police station, which was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.801" offset="1006529">Respondent was detained at the station for perhaps as long as an hour during which time his photograph was taken and the school was called, he was then released.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.628" offset="1045922">Several days later, the photograph taken during the detention was shown to Owens, the robbery victim in a photo array and she identified the respondent as her assailant.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.933" offset="1091062">On the basis of this identification he was arrested, again identified in the lineup and ultimately brought to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.836" offset="1126693">Upon respondent’s motion to suppress all identifications of him, the trial court determined that the act of taking respondent to the police station was an illegal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.869" offset="1170892">The pretrial identifications were fruit of that arrest and must be suppressed, but that the in-court identification of respondent by his alleged victims had an independent basis derived from their substantial opportunity to observe him during the course of the crime and would not be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.346" offset="1240795">The trial was then held.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.285" offset="1248528">Owens positively identified respondent as her assailant, and he was convicted by the jury of armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.583" offset="1281755">On appeal, the en banc District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.276" offset="1316446">It concluded that Owens’ in-court testimony identifying respondent as the robber should have been suppressed as a fruit of the initial illegal detention of Owens.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.370" offset="1368900">Now, we argue in this case for reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals on three separate grounds, any one of which would be sufficient to justify reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.224" offset="1420309">The first ground is our contention that the in-court identification testimony was not a fruit of the illegal police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.476" offset="1453328">The second ground is that under attenuation analysis, any taint, if it was a fruit should be held attenuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.579" offset="1493661">And the third ground is that in any event under the circumstances of this case at least, if not generally, that the testimony of the victim of the crime, particularly a crime of violence ought not to be excluded as a matter of exclusionary rule policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.566" offset="1561684">Now, I’d like to consider first the question which I think is a perplexing one of whether Owens’ in-court identification testimony was a fruit of the illegal detention of Respondent Crews, a subject on which both sides have spilled a great deal of ink.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.618" offset="1645798">It is a given in this case that from the time of the robbery to the time of trial, Owens possessed on the basis of her observations during the robbery, the ability to identify her assailant.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.027" offset="1691460">Nothing that happened during the course of the investigation of this case altered or enhanced that ability except in one respect, the respondent was in court to be identified because of a chain of events proceeding from the unlawful taking of his photograph and of course, if he were not present in court, Owens could not have identified him as her assailant.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.480" offset="1793337">We stress the untainted nature of Owens inherent ability to identify respondent, while he stresses the uselessness of that ability without his presence to be identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.692" offset="1850180">What is really going on here?</text>
            <text syncTime="439.093" offset="1859793">Is it, as the Court of Appeals and respondent insist simply a wholly conventional application of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine?</text>
            <text syncTime="447.603" offset="1893752">Is the victim’s identification of her attacker really no different from drugs seized from a house during an illegal warrantless search or a firearm seized from a person of an illegally-arrested suspect?</text>
            <text syncTime="460.113" offset="1943803">It doesn’t seem to be the same on the surface at least to us, but let’s look more deeply and see whether the superficial appearances are deceiving.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.977" offset="1987271">Now, we submit that a close look at this case reveals what is actually happening here and that is, that the court is suppressing the defendant’s presence at trial on the ground that the probable cause underlying his arrest and indictment is the product of the illegal detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.827" offset="2062712">Respondent would agree, I think, that the court was not suppressing and could not properly have suppressed Owens’ testimony describing the circumstances of the crime or generally describing her recollection of the assailant.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.123" offset="2123839">It is just unconceivable that those things could be fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.673" offset="2138049">The only arguable suppressible ingredient of her testimony concerns her ability to point to the respondent in the courtroom and say, “That’s the man.”</text>
            <text syncTime="518.592" offset="2177755">Now the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in this regard is perhaps most clearly laid out in a portion of the opinion where they are actually discussing the temporal proximity factor and this is a page 38 (a) to 39 (a) of the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.818" offset="2246614">The court says, “While the initial arrest and the taking of the photograph did occur on January 9, 1974, the illegality in this case did not end on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.914" offset="2287052">He eventual rearrest” --</text>

            <text syncTime="580.376" offset="2424874">In fairness to the Court of Appeals, I think the issue is a little bit more complicated than that because the court, I think suggests and odd believe respondents suggests --</text>

            <text syncTime="597.099" offset="2491747">But the court suggests that if you had an independent, wholly, untainted basis for probable cause, then there would be no problem even though he may have been illegally arrested at some stage in the proceedings because you could justify bringing him into court on that basis.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="623.896" offset="2598954">Isn’t it in logic, my brother White’s suggestion inevitable?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="629.923" stopTime="967.108">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="629.923" offset="2623091">Well, if we we’re heading is toward store the Ker-Frisbie kind of problem, I will get to that in just a moment because I think it is very pertinent to this and if you would just bear with me very briefly, I’ll be right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.330" offset="2688711">What the Court of Appeals said was the entire course of events was accomplished in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.198" offset="2712116">Since apparently there was no independent probable cause for official detention the wrong thus continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.201" offset="2740224">And respondent in his brief also suggests that the, I think it’s page 46, Note 37 that the identification testimony by Owens would not be suppressible if the Government had untainted, independent probable cause to try the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.106" offset="2811800">Even, and I think, although you have to ask him, that he would accept that view even if the proceedings in some way originated with an illegal arrest of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.951" offset="2871150">Now, we are prepared to accept the notion that the respondent’s presence in court in this case was logically a fruit of his illegal detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.851" offset="2914826">What we do not accept because it is contrary to settle law, is that his presence in court is subject to suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.616" offset="2957876">That a defendant may not object to being tried on the ground that his presence in court is the product of an illegal seizure of his person is settled by the Ker-Frisbie line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.200" offset="3000195">And this Court said in Gerstein against Pugh the following on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.868" offset="3022869">“In holding of the prosecutor’s assessment of probable cause is not sufficient alone to justify restraint of liberty pending trial, we do not imply that the accused is entitled to judicial oversight or review of the decision to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.066" offset="3083682">Instead, we adhere to the Court’s prior holdings that a judicial hearing is not prerequisite to prosecution by information, nor do we retreat from the established rule that illegal arrests or detention does not void a subsequent conviction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="761.256" offset="3148361">Now in my view, there is only one arguably material distinction between the Ker-Frisbie line of cases and the present case, and I think that the Court of Appeals relied on it, and I should address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.627" offset="3205831">The distinction is that in the Ker-Frisbie line of cases, the probable cause to try the defendant was possessed by the police prior to the time that the defendant was kidnapped in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and brought to court for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.431" offset="3281063">And I think respondent would say that is critical difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.886" offset="3302902">We say that distinction does not help the respondent and we rely for that on the Costello, Blue, Collander line of cases and we have not discussed that in the brief, so I do want to stress it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.177" offset="3352116">It’s the fruit of some further thought in the course of preparing the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.191" offset="3372178">He is saying, “You can’t bring me to trial because the, in effect, the Grand Jury proceeding that found probable cause to try me was tainted.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.428" offset="3409063">It was based on illegally-seized evidence, this photograph and the out-of-court identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.297" offset="3432573">You have no business having me in this courtroom and therefore the inchoate ability that the police already possessed to have Owens identify me should not be usable by the prosecution because it can’t properly be put together with her pointing finger at me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="850.806" offset="3506552">Now, however, Collander establishes, Costello establishes, Blue establishes that you cannot attack the indictment or your presence in court on the basis that it is predicated on illegally-seized evidence or, indeed, on the general lack of probable cause to support the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.984" offset="3591293">So if we are right that the respondent cannot suppress the fact that his presence in court then the only logical basis for his claim is that Owens’ in-court identification was a fruit of his illegal detention disappears.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.161" offset="3648031">Now, I would like to present a hypothetical at this point which I think is quite illuminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.210" offset="3676244">Let us suppose that during the course of the robbery, Owens had a camera and she took a picture of her assailant and when she went to the police she gave the police the undeveloped roll of film and she said, “I think I have a picture of him on this roll of film.”</text>
            <text syncTime="910.070" offset="3743640">She also gave the general description, as she did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.622" offset="3761821">While the film is being developed, the police officers see respondent, exactly the same procedure as here goes on they say to themselves, “We’d better get his picture so that we can compare it with what may come out on the film.”</text>
            <text syncTime="927.358" offset="3812812">They get his picture, they compare it with what came out on the film they say it’s a perfect match.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.149" offset="3836008">He’s indicted, he’s brought into court, we introduced the picture and we say to the jury, “Look at this picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.855" offset="3862758">Look at the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.190" offset="3868087">It’s the same man.”</text>
            <text syncTime="943.613" offset="3877804">Now, in our view, this undeveloped photograph is the same thing as the mental image that Owens had of the crime and of her assailant, and we do not see how it could possibly be concluded in the photograph hypothetical that the photograph is a fruit --</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.262" offset="5068466">In connection with attenuation analysis, we -- excuse me a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.448" offset="5121128">The Court of Appeals and respondent and we all seemed to be agreed that the focal or critical concern with regard to attenuation and I am now assuming that you somehow conclude that this is a fruit and attenuation analysis is proper, is the gravity of the constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.409" offset="5189047">Now, our submission is relatively straightforward in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.624" offset="5205870">First we say there is absolutely no basis in this record for concluding that the police acted in knowing or willful disregard of their constitutional obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.208" offset="5244217">In fact, the Court of Appeals does not deny that they had a reasonable suspicion of respondent’s possible involvement in the crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.579" offset="5269713">He fit the general description, he was identified as having been at the scene on the day of the robbery and the police had at least substantial cause to wonder what he was doing at the Monument grounds on a rainy January day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.314" offset="5324675">Now, under the circumstances, it was entirely reasonable for the police to detain him briefly even to the extent of trying to get his photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.090" offset="5355708">Now, it may be, as the lower courts have held and we haven’t sought review of that question here, that the basis for their suspicion was not enough to justify the further step of taking him to the police station, detaining him for an additional hour or so, taking his photograph and calling his school while he was being held there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.029" offset="5443480">But whether that’s so or not so, it simply seems inconceivable to me that it can be argued that their actions were a flagrant violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of this defendant and the same sense that it was concluded by the court in Brown against Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.229" offset="5524250">Indeed, I might mention that there are cases of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals that suggest in closely analogous situations that a suspect detain on reasonable suspicion maybe taken for a show-up to the scene of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.023" offset="5591437">Now, perhaps those cases would not control this case, but in any event, I think there is no basis for concluding that the officers knew what they were doing was wrong and flagrantly ignored their --</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.920" offset="6287026">Let’s put sophisticated legal argument aside and let’s look at this case as an intelligent layman might.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.353" offset="6316805">Common sense simply cries out for reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.115" offset="6343868">There is simply no process of dry logic that ultimately can justify the holding that Carol Owens may not stand at the bar of justice and identify to a jury the man who robbed her, when her knowledge of the man and his actions are the product of her experiences during the crime itself and not of any subsequent police misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.029" offset="6435506">D.C. Circuit aptly summarized this common sense policy aspect of the case in Payne, where they said, “The consequence of accepting appellant’s contention in the present situation would be that the witness would be forever precluded from testifying against the defendant in court merely because he had complied with the request of the police that he come to police headquarters and had there identified the defendant as the robber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.883" offset="6538951">Such a result is unthinkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.416" offset="6549086">The suppression of the testimony of the complaining witness is not the right way to control the conduct of the police but to the advance the administration of justice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.417" offset="6589001">Accordingly, for that reason and the others that I have discussed, we submit that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.831" offset="10774653">Well, in Frisbie, the police already had, the Government already had probable cause and frankly, except for notions of federalism, the idea that the police can go into a neighboring state and bring somebody back when they already have probable cause, when they have the basis for a prosecution, is not that shocking to a respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2702.746" offset="10914356">But as far as Fourth Amendment law goes, again, the defendants on those cases, the Government did have a prosecution, did have probable cause and the difference between the two cases is exactly why the exclusionary rule needs to be applied in this particular case because here the government, the police had nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.326" offset="10980707">They had no way of solving this particular offense unless they committed the illegal arrest and they knew that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2736.415" offset="11049044">In both senses, Your Honor, the Court of Appeals found that this was a deliberate Fourth Amendment violation in the sense that the police knew that they did not have probable cause but committed the arrest anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.242" offset="11088332">It was also purposeful in the sense that they had an object in mind, a specific fruit in mind and that is identification testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.331" offset="11120724">So in both sense, the illegal arrest was exactly what this Court found in Brown versus Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.305" offset="11152593">A situation where the police committed a flagrantly improper arrest and they had a deliberate goal in Brown in my mind as well, a fruit in Brown and that is the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.486" offset="11197315">And in a situation where you can see what the police are doing or why they are doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.042" offset="11219571">We submit that that is a classic situation where the exclusionary rule needs to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.823" offset="11242663">Now, as far as the question of Frisbie goes and as far as the question of the Grand Jury goes, we are not challenging, and the Court of Appeals made it clear that we are not challenging the jurisdiction of the Court to try this particular case and if the Government had independent evidence they could have elicited the in-court identification or if they have other evidence they could have convicted the respondent in the case but they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.687" offset="11334092">As it turns out in this particular case, the only evidence the Government did have was the in-court identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.250" offset="11356348">The very fruit that the police had in mind at the time of the illegal arrest was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.736" offset="11418311">As we see this case, the decision of this Court makes will really be very similar to the decision that the Court of Appeals made in -- when they faced these facts and that again is a question of whether or not to sanction police misconduct in the situation where they deliberately overstepped the line with a specific fruit in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.096" offset="11503783">And if this Court upholds the Court of Appeals decision, we think again the message will be as clear as this Court has made it in Brown versus Illinois and Dunaway versus New York, and that is that the police cannot overstep the Fourth Amendment with a specific purpose in mind, and if they do so, that that fruit cannot be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.638" offset="11581942">There are no further questions?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="2874.562" offset="11601586">Couple of things, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.047" offset="11619558">First of all, respondent states that the Court of Appeals found the police that knew they were acting unlawfully and I simply have not found that in the Court of Appeals opinion anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.251" offset="11672325">It is true that the Court of Appeals characterized the action as flagrant and the basis for its characterization of it as flagrant was it was that it was purposeful for an investigative motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.065" offset="11715584">Now, the difficulty that we have with respondent’s effort to use that as a touchstone is that it sweeps far too broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.564" offset="11753618">The -- virtually all searches, there may be a few exceptions are made for an investigative motive or the detentions of suspected individuals and you may have the occasional case like Ceccolini where it’s random curiosity or a case where they’re investigating one crime and stumble across evidence of another but normally, there is the element of purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.016" offset="11843480">That can’t be the end of the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.595" offset="11853720">It must be the in determining whether this is the kind of conduct that justifies exclusion under the circumstances you look at the flagrancy and the willfulness of the misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.873" offset="11910875">Now, here it has been suggested that the police had no way of apprehending Mr. Crews and carrying on their investigation of this quite serious crime if they did not take them illegally to the police headquarters to photograph him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.843" offset="11966777">And then obviously is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.219" offset="11972211">They knew his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.450" offset="11977122">They knew he was a student.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.524" offset="11985481">If they had realized that what they were doing was illegal, which by the way had the consequences of costing them the out-of-court identifications and which for all they knew with the time might have cost them the in-court identification, if the trial court had not found that to be independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.218" offset="12052250">They could have called the school system said, “Where does Keith Crews go to school?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.700" offset="12066147">They could have sent an officer out there and taken his photographs at school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.171" offset="12084015">So it isn’t as though this was a question of the only way to enforce the law is to violate the Fourth Amendment, which is what they seem to be saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.255" offset="12124348">There were other alternatives and the conventional deterrence that derives from excluding conventional fruits of an illegal search is, in our view, ample to deter this kind of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.636" offset="12189968">Of course, it won’t always deter it but it’s clear that the policy of this Court is not to press the principal of deterrence and exorable to its farthest point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.040" offset="12227584">All one needs to do is look at the standing cases to see that there are other factors that must be balanced against deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.286" offset="12260498">And one final thing, with regard to this argument that focuses on the purpose to get a particular kind of evidence, the consequence of that argument is that in the case like Davis against Mississippi or Bynum, which Davis discussed, the first fingerprint taken from the scene of the crime ought to be suppressed, because the purpose of the police in arresting or rounding up people was to take their fingerprints to match against the fingerprints in the scene of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.081" offset="12371675">Now, I don’t think that there is anything in Davis that remotely suggests and indeed approves Bynum with the notion that in the re-trial you could still use that first fingerprint and here we say that Carol Owen’s recollection of the robbery is like that first fingerprint.</text>
