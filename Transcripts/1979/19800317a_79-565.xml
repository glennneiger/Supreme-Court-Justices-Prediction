            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">We will hear argument next in Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric v. Public Service Commission of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.885" offset="331922">Mr. Taylor, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready now.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="60.797" offset="347596">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.578" offset="362747">This case also involves an order of the Public Service Commission, it is in our brief on page 3, and is mercifully short "All electric corporations are hereby prohibited from promoting the use of electricity through the use of advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.016" offset="436412">I think the Court will readily see that the constitutional questions raised here are distinct from those in the case that has just been heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.369" offset="477895">The bill insert ban closes a particular channel to speech on public issues this is a complete ban on speech described as promotional advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.161" offset="545081">That, of course, falls within the general category of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.210" offset="561277">That in the decisions of this Court has been called commercial speech, but I think it will appear in the course of the discussion that the line here between commercial speech and other speech is not as clear as it has been in some of the other cases in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.898" offset="639958">Now, I think I should say a word about the genesis of this order because it is different from the chronology of the bill insert case.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.523" offset="682486">The ban there in the same language as on page 3 was enunciated by the commission in a summary emergency fashion in December of 1973 at the time of the Arab oil boycott following the Arab-Israeli war, at a time when there was a genuine and acknowledge belief of a shortage of oil which might not enable the utilities to continue service, and it was put in on that basis at that time, together with an order for voltage reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.700" offset="831175">Months passed, the shortage eased and the voltage restriction was restored, but the promotional ban was retained in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.730" offset="875269">In 1976, the commission inaugurated a proceeding to review whether the promotional ban should be continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.488" offset="918319">Central Hudson and other companies urged that it should be lifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.561" offset="942665">We urged that unsuccessfully, and after losing before the commission and rehearing denied, this litigation was commenced in the New York state courts and, of course, therefore is here on appeal on federal constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.368" offset="1009852">I might also just mention to the Court that a brief has been filed here in amicus on behalf of the Long Island Lighting Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.008" offset="1036392">That was a litigation started in the federal courts, in the Eastern District of New York, in which Judge Pratt ruled that this promotional ban was indeed unconstitutional under the First Amendment but upheld the bill insert ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.116" offset="1092817">That case is pending and has been argued in the Second Circuit but has not been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.963" offset="1128239">Now, before I come to the two matters that I think are very basic here, I would like to mention three things which either are or should be uncontroverted and which I think may clear up a couple of things and avoid the necessity for colloquy.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.723" offset="1199292">In the first place, in this case there is no question about who pays for promotional advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.342" offset="1229803">There is federal legislation declaring federal standards which require that promotional advertising be paid for by the shareholders and not the rate payers.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.948" offset="1272226">The commission's own view is to the same effect and therefore we do not have here any question about the source of funds for promotional advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.433" offset="1330113">The owners of the company bear it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="309.379" stopTime="324.919">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="309.379" offset="1341921">Would this bar, Mr. Taylor, ads in the form of essays, as is sometimes done, promoting the more efficient use of electrical energy?</text>

          <turn speaker="telford_taylor" startTime="324.919" stopTime="352.787">
            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="324.919" offset="1404092">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.637" offset="1410988">The ban is phrased in terms not of consumption of oil or energy resource but the amount of electricity and therefore if we urge by the use of an appliance or in any other way something which will increase the use of electricity, even though it might be a net saving of energy, it comes within the ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.568" offset="1498655">I will be coming in more detail to that point in a few moments.</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="361.424" offset="1550064">You're quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.070" offset="1552677">If the use reduces the amount of electricity used, it is not within the ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.390" offset="1573992">The promotional ban is defined as anything which might be expected to increase the use of electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.903" offset="1608056">In the second place, neither the commission nor any other authority, state or federal, has done anything which prohibits the underlying activity here, that is there is no restriction on the distribution, sale and use of electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.769" offset="1679423">It is perfectly lawful, and the commission's brief said that they haven't even tried to discourage the use of electricity for heating and therefore it is beyond argument I think that the effect of this ban is to with-hold from the public information about an activity which is perfectly lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.900" offset="1759984">In the third place, although this ban in its origin in December of 1973 was based on an actual shortage of oil, that is not the case with the commission's decision in 1977 which continues the ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.279" offset="1841486">There is nothing in the record, there is nothing in my opponent's brief, there is nothing which indicates any present or approximate shortage of oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.160" offset="1893000">The conservation theory which has been invoked in support of the order is rather that there is a continued dependence on foreign oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.578" offset="1942737">That is the conservation factor which is primarily relied on in the commission's decision in the Court of Appeals and therefore, of course, I will be addressing that value which is invoked to support the ban I hope before I sit down.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="473.300" offset="1997594">Mr. Taylor, supposing that a drug manufacturer sent out a letter saying ask your doctor to prescribe morphine for your pain you have, now the prescription of morphine is perfectly legal in most states, but you do have to get it by prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.825" offset="2083694">Would you say that that was a violation of the first Amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="498.286" offset="2097591">Well, if it was encouraging him to get it without a prescription, it would, of course, be advocating unlawful conduct and I suppose it would fall within the traditional category of speech which can be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.790" offset="2147537">But the point of my making my so-called point two there was precisely that there is nothing unlawful about the use of the electricity the sale or the distribution and indeed --</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="541.342" offset="2269790">That is encouraging the use of what are called controlled substances, well known to be dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.513" offset="2290479">It is very much like, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I take it the tobacco ban on advertising tobacco which is lawful to smoke, which Your Honors did uphold in the tobacco case. Of course, the nature of using morphine and the nature of using electric heating is different as night from day in terms of general opinion about whether this is good or bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.283" offset="2389535">May I come to the two points which seem to me of the greatest importance here and which I think go further than anything else to show why the court below and the commission have fallen into constitutional error here.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.221" offset="2445228">In the Court of Appeals, these two things I am about to mention led the court to say that General Hudson's First Amendment rights are in this case at the "nadir" and having them put them in that low a state, of course, it was unnecessary to scrutinize very carefully the value factor invoked to support the ban because so low a category is placed on the speech itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.015" offset="2560481">Now, the most important point here I believe is in our brief on page 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.057" offset="2596634">We have quoted the governing paragraph in the Court of Appeals decision which, as Your Honors would see, treats this case as simply one where, since we have a monopoly in the distribution of electric energy and since the price is controlled by the -- the rates are controlled by the commission, that there can be no value in discussion about the use of electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.500" offset="2714394">Consumers have no choice regarding the source of their electric power, the price of electricity simply may not be reduced by competitive shopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.015" offset="2744487">Well, Your Honors, we say that that demonstrates a very fundamental misconception about what the speech involved in this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.690" offset="2779178">Of course, it is true that the price of electric energy to the rate payer is regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.214" offset="2801225">Of course, it is true that, as a substantial matter, our company is the only source of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.221" offset="2821287">But it wholly overlooks the fact that people don't take electric energy for its own sake because it can be turned into heat and light and power and to goods of that kind, and that in terms especially of temperature control, of heating and cooling, the company's share of this is not only not a monopoly, it is very much a minority share.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.180" offset="3021072">Well, that question can't be answered fully without taking account both of statutory matters which I don't think are relevant here and constitutional matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.489" offset="3054404">There would be statutory problems about the commission's authority to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="763.452" offset="3158162">Well, there would be a matter of showing if there was a reasonable basis for the restriction and, of course, ordinarily the standards of review on that are very relaxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.981" offset="3200272">If this were a prohibition which began to impinge on existing service to customers and reduced them o a bad circumstance in terms of heat why, then you might well have a stricter standard of review to show the necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.353" offset="3965764">Well, to complete my point there, since the commission -- the court, in other words, in this passage on page 15, wholly mistook the nature of the market which is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.811" offset="4023651">The monopoly and the supply of electric energy does not mean at all that the company is not in sharp competition with other energy sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.976" offset="4064298">Now, the facts and circumstances about the relative merits of these energy sources are matters of public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1052.644" offset="4314969">It would seem to me not, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.803" offset="4327612">In the first place, this would bring me to the fourth point in my brief, that if this were regarded as an equalizing measure, it is a strange one indeed because 75 percent or more of the heating is by home oil furnaces and there is no restriction on the advertising and promotion of heat derived from that source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.133" offset="4416951">It is limited to the distribution of electric energy and therefore far from it being an equalizing thing, it is a discriminatory thing because only this one relatively small side of the energy picture is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.148" offset="4477032">The other matter on which it seems to us the Court of Appeals and the commission have been led astray is because, in addition to the point I have just discussed, they have relied here heavily on the thought that because Central Hudson is a regulated public utility, that by that fact in and of itself our First Amendment rights are less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.653" offset="4591031">I would have thought that the Belotti case had laid at rest that point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.661" offset="4615064">Of course, I am aware that that case was decided by a closely decided Court, but I don't think that the area of disagreement in the Belotti case has much to do with what is before the Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.357" offset="4665846">In the Belotti case, the state value invoked to limit the corporate speech was itself in the nature of a First Amendment value, the idea of a prophylactic rule that would prevent public discussion from being dominated by corporate resources, and the Court had to strike a balance between those and they disagreed on how to strike the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.505" offset="4754453">But we don't have that situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.287" offset="4761558">What is being invoked on the other side here is not of the same character or stripe at all and therefore the considerations in the Belotti case that led to the division in the Court don't seem to be of bearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.656" offset="4819028">Certainly I think it is clear in the Belotti case that both the majority and minority thought that corporate entities do have the rights of commercial speech and in the majority opinion the standard to be used was exacting scrutiny, both of the dissents recognized the same thing, and indeed Mr. Justice White's dissent strongly suggested that corporate rights in the commercial area might well be greater than the political area because of the closer nexus with the corporation's own business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.987" offset="4948386">In that connection, can I remark in conclusion here on this aspect of the case that we have here none of the factors which the Court has referred to in some of these cases, the common sense differences between commercial speech and other speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.494" offset="5010348">We have none of the factors which the Court has mentioned as reasons for giving commercial speech a lesser degree of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.976" offset="5044308">This order has nothing to do with whether speech is deceptive or misleading or anything of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.842" offset="5071788">It has nothing to do with overreaching solicitation, as in Ohralik.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.220" offset="5089238">There are several cases, including Friedman v. Rogers, in which the Court has tabulated these distinctive features of commercial speech and none of them are present here and therefore for all those reasons that I have now covered, we strongly urge that the speech in this case is highly akin to public issue discussion, that there is no reason in this case why the same standard should not be applied to speech that was applied in the Belotti case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.428" offset="6470071">They are also asserting the right to control promotional advertising because of its effect on the rate structure, an area in which they have full powers under their right powers to deal with it in other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.905" offset="6523988">So that the assertion of power here by the commission is pretty open-ended, Mr. Justice White, and it seems to us that the lack of the standard is fatal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.593" offset="6554812">May I come back, if I may, in conclusion, to the matter of conservation because I think this is crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.892" offset="6592010">Since the matter is not one of shortage of oil but of continued dependence on foreign oil, we have a problem which is primarily a national problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.303" offset="6629627">The federal decision is a considered one, the matter of prohibiting promotional advertising was raised, the committee report quite specifically says it is not intended to accomplish that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.157" offset="6705068">So we think that that is highly relevant in determining the substantially of invoking conservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.718" offset="6959292">Certainly Mr. Taylor has explained one of the reasons why we imposed the ban on the promotion of electricity by utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.246" offset="7005372">I want to say that our ban has been on all promotion of electricity by the electric utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.912" offset="7052079">Our order did consider in some detail the requests by some of the utilities that they should be allowed to promote off-peak uses for particularly space heating which is in the form of -- in two forms, one is electric resistance heating and the other is in terms of the heat pumps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.107" offset="7156778">Now, the primary reason for this ban is that New York is terribly oil dependent and any time an additional kilowatt hour of electricity is generated in New York, at just about any time, day or night, winter or summer, additional oil is burned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.496" offset="7266388">Oil is what burned at the margin in New York state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.197" offset="8753173">But what I am saying is that utilities, monopoly utilities, the reason the state has regulated them is a matter of historically because utilities really requested the regulation in order to be protected from having public power, which is true in so many other countries, but they are different in terms of how they operate and the competition that we have here is very limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.928" offset="8844079">The Court of Appeals was perfectly correct in at least recognizing that the dominant aspect of electric utilities was serving as a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.013" offset="8896428">Now, in terms of the conservation here, the reason that this is important, we think that having utilities promote -- now, by promoting it is not giving price information, it is essentially saying to the public, go out and use electricity and at the same time they are supposed to be telling the public to save electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.146" offset="8989006">And the more oil that we use, the more expensive it gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.956" offset="9004262">The oil in New York is the most expensive in the country, I suppose because it is the lowest sulfur oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.800" offset="9027563">Ninety percent or more than 90 percent of our oils comes from foreign sources because that is the kind of oil, residual oil that is burned in our generators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.420" offset="9066120">In addition to that, we have a rate problem, at least in New York, where the rates unfortunately are probably the highest in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.439" offset="9106139">I looked this up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.387" offset="9109901">I say with regret that the average price used at the time of highest consumption, which is basically in the summer time in the areas served by Central Hudson as well as LILCO, is priced below what the real cost to the society is or what the consumer is, but we have not yet been able to develop the marginal costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.675" offset="9219093">We haven't had all the information or the equipment that is necessary to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.156" offset="9237065">In the meantime, to have people add these services on the basis of the prices that are now being charged, encouraging to do that, promoting it, which is not just plain advertising, it is asking them to add that service, is really inherently misleading as we explain in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.035" offset="9320552">Now, we realize, of course, that in banning we are intruding on the commercial speech rights, the First Amendment considerations that were considered by the commission, but this case is different from the other case in that there was the problem that consumers could only get the price information of prescription drugs practically through advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.060" offset="9452628">Here the price information, there is one price for electricity, it is public knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.558" offset="12686587">It is a peculiar setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.879" offset="12691916">They are not subject to our jurisdiction because they get their power from the power authority of the state of New York and by statute we do not regulate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.866" offset="12735906">But unlike some other places, there is very little electric power sold by the municipals in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.231" offset="12785330">I do want to say that in the past we had restrictions on the promotion of telephone, we still have some restriction on the promotion of gas service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.375" offset="12849904">We imposed restrictions on telephone promotion in the early seventies when service in down-state New York was just incredibly poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.043" offset="12892536">As that service improved, the restrictions got lifted and the commission has been flexible and has adjusted to the exigencies of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.289" offset="12949588">And if a showing can be made that promotion in fact is going to conserve energy, which it has never been made to us, the commission's order says we are ready to relax our ban, we're not interested in banning for the sake of banning it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.292" offset="13021581">We think that is basically a bad idea, if we can avoid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.249" offset="13033388">In gas, we have been relaxing it as more gas has become available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.813" offset="13055645">And I think in viewing the commission's experience in this, I think that is something also to keep in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.568" offset="13086678">But what the utilities say, let us go ahead and do what we ever want to do, and it doesn't really make any difference what effect it has on the rate payers, the mere fact that there is competition on a small part of this business does not protect the consumers generally, it is an important reason to approve the ban on promotion here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.755" offset="13343410">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.570" offset="13354695">I would just like to make an additional comment with respect to the question that Mr. Justice Stevens addressed to Mr. Schiff, suggesting a newly developed housing area, should it be resistance heating or some other form, and Mr. Schiff's reply was that resistance heating would take more oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.129" offset="13432957">That of course may be true if the energy is electrically fired, but may I call your attention to Mr. Schiff's brief which says on page 18 that the commission has never taken the position that electric space heating should be discouraged, and also says that there is no sufficient basis for any action banning electric heating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.514" offset="13522401">That is certainly true, there is no shortage of oil, there is no shortage of electric capacity, there is no need for rationing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.389" offset="13621979">The advantages, of course, of electric heating are that it is clear, its use in the home is pollution free, you don't have gas trucks running over the place and polluting and burning up gas, and we say that under these circumstances that --</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.294" offset="13733575">Well, I read it though at page 18 of his brief that there is no basis for the restrictions on electric heating, and we say if that is so that you cannot put a sort of slow brake on it by forbidding the public to be informed about the advantages that are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.540" offset="13810584">Now, one other thing which I would like to mention, the notion that if we promote electric energy we are giving the public misleading signals about conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.865" offset="13855828">You will find in our reply brief an example of what has been done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.450" offset="13878188">We have save energy programs in which various ways of saving energy are indicated to the public and by display, and so forth, accompanied however by information about the heat pump.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.534" offset="13938584">The commission has questioned our doing that under this ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.748" offset="13951436">There is in fact a vagueness problem with this ban, too, though I have not stressed it because I think there are more fundamental arguments, but there is that vagueness argument and the fact is that, despite his adverse comments on the heat pump, the New York Legislature has recently required us to finance their installation under some circumstances and have specified the heat pump as an energy saving device.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.366" offset="14049865">So I think the gist of my very brief reply is that with all respect, Mr. Justice White, I think it is over-simplified to say that any promotion is going to be energy costly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.126" offset="14104931">It is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.693" offset="14107126">Some of it is going to be energy economical and the order ignores that.</text>
