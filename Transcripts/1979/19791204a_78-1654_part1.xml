            <text syncTime="39.850" offset="262771">I believe there are two essential questions before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.426" offset="277086">First, whether sponsorship alone infringes upon the constitutional rights of these respondents and secondly, whether it's in the best interest of this country to virtually end the patronage system.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.371" offset="332884">In this case, we are not dealing with full time teachers, janitors or deputy sheriffs whose only income is their government job which they have more than some expectancy of continuation, but rather before this Court, come the respondents, attorneys with private practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="73.902" offset="399026">Well, in your second -- your second question, counsel, whether it's in the best interest of this country to end the patronage system is not really a constitutional question over which this question would -- this Court would have jurisdiction, as a -- it's up to New York or Nassau County unless there's a constitutional provision to the contrary to make that decision for itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.845" offset="582719">However, I will -- if you want me to espouse in that, there is politics even in civil service.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.480" offset="609259">Since the department head can pick from the top three, and he could find his friend even sixth or seventh, if he wait until the exam comes out or when the examine is published, some of the top people have already received positions, and you can work it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.564" offset="669654">So there is politics in civil service as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.258" offset="688358">Rockland County actually has a very good record in civil service.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.588" offset="709674">In fact, out of 2000 employees, there are mere 50 approximately.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.720" offset="838301">We will argue that there was no compelling -- we don't have to show a compelling state interest because, in fact, we see no denial of any constitutional right in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.971" offset="887306">Unlike Elrod, there was no coercion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.693" offset="902144">No one asked the respondents to leave the Republican Party, to contribute to the Democratic Party, to swear allegiance to the Democratic Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.696" offset="934118">In fact, they were simply ignored, not rehired, and I cannot see where that is a denial of their right for freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.806" offset="974555">They do also make a claim of some sort of an expectancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.123" offset="991901">However, I do not see any objective expectancy equaling any property right or any denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.155" offset="1023979">In this case, the respondents served at the pleasure of the appointing authority, that was their public defender, Mr. Barone, the prior.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.353" offset="1068805">If you can envision that the public defender is the hand and the assistants are the fingers, when the hand goes so do the fingers.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.798" offset="1102555">Now, on December 31st, 1977 at 12 midnight, Mr. Barone's term was over, he was being replaced.By law, they also terminated.</text>
