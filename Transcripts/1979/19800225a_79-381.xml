            <text syncTime="62.452" offset="353155">Mr. Reid, you may begin whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John W. Reid, II</label>
            <text syncTime="66.331" offset="368724">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.434" offset="393070">The question presented in this particular case is whether the 1976 Revised Statutes of Missouri Section 287.240 which authorizes worker's compensation death benefits for the spouse of a male worker without regard to dependency but conditions benefits for the spouse of a female worker upon mental and physical incapacity or proof of dependency discriminates impermissibly on the basis of gender in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Question.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.755" offset="530369">This case arose at the death of Ruth Wengler on February 11, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.236" offset="560358">Thereafter a workman compensation claim was filed by the claimant for the death of his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.950" offset="587212">The referee and the Industrial Commission of the State of Missouri held that they did not have the authority to declare a Missouri statute provision on the death benefits unconstitutional and therefore disallowed the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.159" offset="651995">The claim was appealed to the Circuit Court of Madison County where the Circuit Judge there held that due to the Missouri Constitution and the Federal Constitution the Equal Protection Clause, the death benefits to the workman compensation for Paul Wengler had been denied and therefore ruled in favor of the claimant and indicated that the benefits should be applied to Mr. Wengler for the death of his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.954" offset="783235">Thereafter Druggists Mutual appealed this decision to the Missouri Supreme Court and there in a divided opinion the Missouri Supreme Court reversed the Circuit Court of Madison County, holding that they would not apply the strict scrutiny test as it had been applied by members of this Court in appropriate sex discrimination cases but instead applied the other test that have been applied, the substantial relation test.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.769" offset="906428">And held that under the substantial relation test that Equal Protection Clause had not been violated by the Missouri workman compensation benefit statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.908" offset="967032">But Justice Donnelly in a concurring opinion basically indicated that he was troubled because he didn't know what the supreme law of the land was and Justice Sieler in his opinion -- which was a dissenting opinion, the sole dissenting opinion -- pointed out that the majority opinion even though it applied the substantial relation test that the -- in his opinion that this Court would have found that the Missouri workman compensation death benefit violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of this Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.337" offset="1116766">And pointing out that members of this Court had applied the substantial relation test and therefore the substantial relations test and the strict scrutiny test both would not pass the Missouri workman compensation death benefit as it applied in the State of Missouri in the Wengler case.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.868" offset="1198895">And the dissenting opinion was held in favor of the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.063" offset="1219584">After this case was accepted and briefs started being written, we received a telephone call from the Department of Justice and also the American Civil Liberties Union and they both filed amicus curiae briefs on behalf of the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.206" offset="1288234">And I thought that this was very strange when I received the phone call from the Department of Justice, because the American Civil Liberties Union and the Department of Justice had been litigating these matters before this Court in the Social Security cases, Federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.914" offset="1347062">And after obtaining the amicus curiae brief from the Department of Justice I found out that what happened after the Goldfarb cases, the Social Security case which was a 5-4 decision, that Congress thereafter instructed the Department of Justice to go through the Social Security laws and to advise Congress how the gender discrimination in the Social Security law could be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.178" offset="1460120">And according to the brief of the Department of Justice they have complied with that public law which is on page 3 of the amicus curiae's brief and in February 1979 they had made a report back to Congress of how the gender-based discrimination can be corrected by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.095" offset="1543711">So that I think this is an expression by Congress that they want to correct the gender-based discrimination that still is in the Social Security laws.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="372.250" offset="1592404">Did Congress do anything in response to that report?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_w_reid_ii" startTime="376.216" stopTime="598.557">
            <label>Mr. John W. Reid, II</label>
            <text syncTime="376.216" offset="1608286">Justice Rehnquist, I think that this report took place in February of 1979 and to my knowledge, and what I have is from the amicus curiae brief, Congress has not passed any law at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.212" offset="1688221">I think that it is the claimant's position that the Missouri majority misread and misapplied the tests that have been applied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.405" offset="1732942">And to be quite fair with the Missouri Supreme Court, there were some cases that came down about the same time as the Missouri decision last term, this Court, the Orr case and also the Westcott case.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.049" offset="1783620">And in those cases the plurality of the Court held that the alimony statute of the State of Alabama violated the Equal Protection Clause and also a portion of the Federal statute on aid to dependent children, also violated the Equal Protection Clause where it only applied benefits to the father who was unemployed and not to a mother that was unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.161" offset="1888005">I think the American Civil Liberties Union -- of course I have a client and not a cause -- the American Civil Liberties Union would like to see the Court adopt the strict scrutiny test.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.483" offset="1933354">Quite frankly I don't believe that the decisions of this Court in the last decade would have been any different if the strict scrutiny test which Justice Brennan has written about in many decisions in 1970 would have been applied by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.271" offset="2004407">The Court has held in the Kahn case, the decision written by Justice Douglas, that in the area of taxation that the Constitution and this Court has given States great leeway and this is a particular area where they have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.871" offset="2094895">And I think that under that particular decision that applying the strict scrutiny test that that decision would stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.498" offset="2129377">The Schlesinger v. Ballard case involved a decision involving up and out of the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.508" offset="2181413">A member of the Armed Forces who was an officer had to move up or be booted out of the service and this Court held, the plurality, that in that particular case that the Constitution gave to Congress the authority to man the services and that this was of germane purpose and that the Court would not use the Equal Protection Clause to take away that duty and that power that is delegated to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.209" offset="2324250">In Califano v. Webster which was a pro curiam decision of this Court and there was a provision of the Social Security Act which gave benefits to a woman by deducting three years off of her earnings requirements for benefits that this was a specific Act of Congress to do away with some past discrimination that women had been shackled with over the many years.</text>

            <text syncTime="598.557" offset="2497599">Mr. Reid, do you think the Missouri statute discriminates against men or against women?</text>

            <text syncTime="601.713" offset="2510242">I think it discriminates against both, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.825" offset="2518706">I think it discriminates against a working woman and I think perhaps a few decades ago it was the place for the woman to remain in the home and take care of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.548" offset="2557576">Today, with inflation, with our way of life, a number of women work outside the home and raise the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.248" offset="2588400">And so by denying the workman compensation benefits it does discriminate against not only males but also females.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.748" offset="2702399">But she, on the other foot, if the wife passes away -- the mother -- then the father has a void there.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.675" offset="3646046">In the Reed case to eliminate hearings on appointment of administrators Justice Burger in his opinion indicated that that was not a legitimate classification, giving preference to a male over a female.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.032" offset="3699545">Also in the Reed come to avoid inner family controversy, that was not a valid classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.918" offset="3727026">Administrative convenience in one decision by Justice Brennan in the Frontiero decision was not a valid reason for the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.122" offset="3767881">In the (Inaudible) decision, Justice Brennan's opinion, the fact that the women were the -- the males were primary supporters, the fact that the women were given benefits in the event of a husband's death to take care of the children, which is very close to this case, that benefits should be paid to the male in the event of the wife's decease.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.798" offset="3890552">And in the Craig case Justice Brennan points out that statistical data is not very helpful in deciding Equal Protection cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.314" offset="3936632">The accident of birth -- and that is what this is -- sexual classification, gender classification, it is an accident of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.370" offset="3976861">And in the Goldfarb case, which is very similar to this one, a Social Security case.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.120" offset="3999848">And I would say that the dissenting opinion in those cases indicated that this was social legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.305" offset="4020642">The workmen compensation benefit cases are not social-type cases legislation on that Justice Rehnquist was writing about in his dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.650" offset="4069961">And finally, in the Westcott case Justice Blackburn indicated that the one-step test that was advanced in the dissenting opinion in Goldfarb no longer would be followed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.658" offset="4125968">I would also point out to the Court that the strict scrutiny test is based upon race and that was an amendment to the Constitution by the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.319" offset="4196603">And some 50 years after that an amendment was passed, the Nineteenth Amendment, and that gave women the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.494" offset="4229308">And in this classification I think that this could be a suspect classification, strict scrutiny should be applied to sexes as well as race because sex is an even broader term than race, alienage or national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.078" offset="4295659">All races have two sexes become extinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.451" offset="4305168">This is a law of nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.949" offset="4319169">Justice Powell indicated in a concurring opinion in the Craig decision that due to the fact that the Equal Rights Amendment is pending the Court should not go ahead and apply the strict scrutiny test at this particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.038" offset="4407568">I would point out that the race and the sex are both amendments to this Constitution and perhaps as the American Civil Liberties Union has stressed that it is time to apply the strict scrutiny test in these gender classification cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1336.104" offset="5447764">We are talking in this case about a Workmen's Compensation law, I think possibly the first time that this Court has had an industrial accident law in the context with gender discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.567" offset="5493635">Most of the cases in this area have arisen out of Social Security laws or Federal welfare laws of one type or another and they have not arisen out of Workmen's Compensation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.141" offset="5543894">There are differences between these laws and I think the difference may well influence the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.079" offset="5567718">So I would like to go back and talk about the history and the origin and the philosophy that underlies a Workmen's Compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.599" offset="5601782">As you recall, these laws came into being in the early part of the century in Missouri in the 1920's and they came into being because of a distinct need which had arisen in an industrialized society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.948" offset="5655176">People were getting hurt in the factories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.167" offset="5668028">Unfortunately the remedy available to them, the common law remedy of master servant was not sufficient at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.928" offset="5699062">Statistically about 30 percent of these people received any recovery -- recoveries were received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.511" offset="5721422">It was an uneven handling of it, many received nothing at all because the common law defenses of master servant contributory negligence fellow servant rule barred claims from being made and the result created not only a terrible problem for the injured working person but for society itself because these people had to -- became wards or tended to become wards of society when people were hurt or killed in industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.670" offset="5838033">It was in response to that need that the Workmen's Compensation concept was worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.877" offset="5866872">The objective of the compensation concept was to pass on to industry, which is the area where people get hurt, the cost of these injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.827" offset="5910653">The notion was to get certain benefits and with prompt payment into the hands of the injured working people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.768" offset="5942418">The method that was used to achieve this result was a bargain method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.671" offset="5966033">That is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.800" offset="5970526">All of these rights and duties and liabilities that appear in Workmen's Compensation laws and certainly in the laws of Missouri are bargained rights and liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.485" offset="6005321">That is exactly how the law was put together there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.520" offset="6013471">The trade associations, labor unions representing the working people on the one hand, various management organizations representing management through the public forum of the legislature, and everybody had to give up something to get something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.929" offset="6071045">The result in Missouri and elsewhere was a law that provided a brand new remedy wholly substitutional, an exclusive remedy before an administrative tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.830" offset="6118693">The benefits the law granted were limited to economic loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.390" offset="6140949">This was the only thing to be paid under Workmen's Compensation and everything else was given up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.980" offset="6159339">One of the great things the employees had to give up in order to obtain liability without fault and reparation for economic loss was the opportunity to obtain the general damages, damages for anything other than economic loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.014" offset="6215450">But the whole Workmen's Compensation concept is based upon reparation of economic loss to the employee or to the employee's dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.422" offset="6253066">The workmen's Compensation scheme measures this economic loss by medical payments on the one hand, weekly benefits for temporary disabilities, amounts for permanent disabilities rated by weeks and in cases of death the formula used is based upon dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.415" offset="6353063">The point of all of this is that in this kind of a law which incidentally the employee contributes nothing to it, specifically by statute is now allowed to in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.772" offset="6398412">Of course I suppose you would call it a fringe benefit, it is a cost but the cost of this is borne by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.206" offset="6428191">The net effect of all of this is that the purpose of the Workmen's Compensation law is to pay for economic loss only, nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.991" offset="6483362">And so if a death occurs, as in this unfortunate case here where there is no economic loss and it stipulated there is no economic loss, this law was never meant to provide Mr. Wengler --</text>
