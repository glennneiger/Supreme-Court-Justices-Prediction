            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="60.590" offset="345736">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.459" offset="357230">This is part -- I wish I could say the last part -- of the final chapter in the dispute between the United States and the State of Louisiana over the mineral resources of the Continental Shelf off the coast of that state, a controversy which has been before this Court since 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.274" offset="448449">At the end of the day, Louisiana's more extravagant claims to parts of that Continental Shelf were rejected and its was settled that Louisiana was entitled only to a three-mile belt measured from its coast in the usual way.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.428" offset="529115">Finally, in 1975, the Louisiana coastline, that is to say the base line from which that three-mile belt is measured was fixed by decree entered by this Court on June 16th.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.483" offset="589302">That decree was jointly submitted by the parties and entered by consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.563" offset="609573">I immediately stress that that decree, in defining the areas that were federal and those which were state, expressly provided that the coastline defined in it was to be taken as the past and present coastline for all relevant times and purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.355" offset="688776">That is to say that true or not, as a matter of law, the coastline was treated as having been unchanged and the portions attributable to the federal and state government unchanged since June 5, 1950, the accounting date, the earliest relevant date, with only three exceptions which fortunately do not concern us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.209" offset="808208">In three areas, the Court approved the Master's finding that for some periods islands or extensions of the mainland had existed whereas for others they have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.869" offset="858885">The relevance of this is that all the accounting in this case have been based on that premise, that is that the coastline has not changed in thirty years.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.087" offset="903711">Now, although the three-mile line extending from the coastline has not formally been entered by decree here, the parties within a month of the Court's last decision, the decree of June 16, 1975, agreed to that line simply as a matter of mathematical projection, and that description has been submitted to the Special Master and is before the Court and there is no dispute about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.068" offset="1031607">What remains are purely accounting issues, not boundary questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.703" offset="1054177">We are done with geography.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.704" offset="1058147">We are now quarreling about money, that is to say the monetary consequences of the boundary determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.014" offset="1095450">We had hoped that no such issue would remain for this Court and indeed it did not appear that there was any disagreement between the parties until 1975 when for the first time Louisiana made the claims which this Court referred to its Special Master on which he wrote a report and which are now before this Court on exceptions to that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.446" offset="1213106">So far as this Court is concerned if it accepts our acquiescence in one of the rulings of the Special Master adverse to the United States with respect to severance tax, which we do not press here, that leaves two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.948" offset="1283114">The first issue is simply put whether Louisiana must pay over to the United States subject to appropriate offsets the oil and gas revenues which it collected from lessees since June 1950 and which are attributable to federal areas of the Continental Shelf, just as the United States must pay, for the most part has paid to Louisiana the receipts from the same date attributable to state lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.745" offset="2018304">It is exactly as you said, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.011" offset="2027395">The Master held with Louisiana on its claim to retain what we call the federal monies from Zone 1 and partially Zone 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.917" offset="2059055">He held with the United States in that he rejected Louisiana's claim to interest on the impounded funds which we for the most part have long since paid over.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.338" offset="2096776">Now, I shall address both issues but, being the except all with respect to the federal monies Louisiana retains, I shall concentrate my argument there.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.884" offset="2142960">As I have indicated, some $19 million are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.780" offset="2158529">It has been called the Zone 1 issue and so it seemed at first, but later -- and I may say after the accounting filed in in this Court and in the proceedings before the Special Master and in some cases only in the last two or three years, reference having been five years ago, Louisiana has changed its position somewhat and is now resisting, as we understand them -- the Attorney General can correct correct me -- resisting paying any of the monies collected by the state from federal submerged lands in any zone for any period, including the last five years, and indeed including until such time as this Court enters a further decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.200" offset="2344208">Now, it is unfortunately necessary to explain what Zone 1 is.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.911" offset="2366986">By 1956, both the United States and the state were granting leases, conflicting leases in the area which Louisiana claimed to be its submerged land under the act passed three years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.443" offset="2429158">Louisiana sought injunctions and obtained injunctions in its own state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.352" offset="2452773">We had by this time filed a motion for leave to renew the case in this Court which had been granted and accordingly we applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.247" offset="2500315">This Court, on the application of the United States, enjoined both parties from granting any new leases and their lessees from drilling any further wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.629" offset="2553919">That situation produced the so-called interim agreement of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.311" offset="2580668">That agreement divided the Continental Shelf into the four zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.664" offset="2601984">Zone 1, with which we are primarily concerned, is the area three miles wide and nearest the Louisiana coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.746" offset="2642317">It was fixed on a rough -- and I emphasize rough -- approximation of the area which the United States then believed under then principles, since changed, had been granted by the Submerged Lands Act to Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.420" offset="2709086">Mr. Claiborne, I take it that if the interim agreement had not come into existence, this issue would not be here?</text>

            <text syncTime="660.142" offset="2743986">Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, so it seemed, but Louisiana now makes a wholly different argument nonetheless dependent on the interim agreement which is that though they received the money they never really leased our lands because the lease descriptions were such that impliedly they were telling the lessee you drill or occupy federal lands at your own risk, an argument with which I will deal but which is the latest of Louisiana positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.470" offset="2885256">Now, this Court has already clearly held that neither party was bound by the Zone 1 line and indeed it is because of that holding that the major part of the present controversy arises, because the United States was adjudicated to be the true owner of lands within Zone 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.389" offset="2980968">On the other hand, the state was entitled under this Court's decision to the lands seaward of that zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.916" offset="3015032">So the Zone 1 line and the true boundary line do not coincide.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.904" offset="3043035">One more word about the interim agreement at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.009" offset="3055365">That agreement did provide Louisiana's primary reliance on this fact, that Louisiana would have exclusive administrative control in that zone, and it was not provided that the revenues derived from its leases there need be impounded; whereas, in Zones 2 and 3 in practice administered by the United States, those revenues must be impounded against the day when the true ownership was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.203" offset="3184201">In Zone 4, as I have already indicated beyond any Louisiana claim, the United States was free to grant leases and had no obligation to impound.</text>

          <turn speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="784.055" stopTime="1408.774">
            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="784.055" offset="3239581">Because, Mr. Justice Blackmun, it was recognized and largely correctly that most of Zone 1 would in any event go to Louisiana even though it was known then that the boundary was not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.579" offset="3297677">Louisiana asked and the United States agreed to allow it to enjoy some of the revenues from this area and therefore since most of those revenues would in any event remain with Louisiana, it seemed right and fair to permit Louisiana to enjoy those revenues without a duty to impound.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.584" offset="3393703">It would, however, have been nonsense and most improvident for the United States to have agreed to waive all its claims to revenue there without waiving its claim to title.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.753" offset="3442395">And this Court has made it clear that there was no way for a title, indeed title has been adjudicated there, because, after all, this case was primarily one about mineral revenues, not about abstract title.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.072" offset="3507702">It would have permitted, as Louisiana says it did permit, Louisiana largely to drain the area and to return to us twenty years later or perhaps twenty-five years later an empty title, the oil and gas drained from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.847" offset="3590771">That is precisely what Louisiana says we agreed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.082" offset="3603728">Why we should have done so is hard to fathom.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.909" offset="3650957">Now, I have indicated that Louisiana's resistant to our claim is in respect to Zone 1 monies between the date of the agreement, October 1956, and the date on which it ended for this purpose, June 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.423" offset="3729115">But they are not satisfied to resist only those claims, they also resist the claim for some $3.3 million derived from Zone 2 which is in no way committed to them by the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.875" offset="3802885">They also resist a claim to an additional $500,000 derived before the agreement was entered into from Zone 1, and they also resist a claim to any amounts since this Court's degree fixing the boundary, in June 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.596" offset="3889716">Now, the basic question is why shouldn't Louisiana be required to pay over the monies derived from federal lands, just as the United States is required to do likewise with respect to state lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.414" offset="3953037">Ever since 1950, the rule of the case has been that the owner of the lands is entitled to the revenues, regardless of who first received them.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.969" offset="3999222">That obligation has been deferred over and over again but it has never been varied.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.492" offset="4025344">The Special Master himself said this would certainly be the case in the absence of any adjudication or agreement between the parties to the contrary, and we entirely endorse that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.424" offset="4093053">So we look to see whether there was a ruling by this Court which authorizes the exception from what had otherwise been the law of the case, and we find everything to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.369" offset="4152822">In 1950, this Court established the basic rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.465" offset="4173197">Each party must account since June 5, 1950, the date on which this Court's decision in the Louisiana case was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.762" offset="4218441">That was forgiven for the first three miles by the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.196" offset="4236204">But in 1960, this Court made clear that that was the extent of the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.358" offset="4260760">In 1960, seven years after the Submerged Lands Act, and four years after the '56 agreement, and yet Louisiana consented to the entry of a decree which explicitly requires it to account and pay over eventually all sums derived from federal lands with no exception for Zone 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.643" offset="4361906">In 1965, a supplemental decree followed the same formula and, most importantly, in the most recent decree, in 1975, the Court entered by consent a decree expressly requiring Louisiana to account for unimpounded monies since June 1950 derived from federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.756" offset="4478412">Louisiana admits that that is the money we are talking about, but they say the accounting is for information only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.297" offset="4516551">Why it should have undertaken or the Court should have burdened it with the not inconsiderable task of computing receipts for thirty years if nothing were to turn on it escapes us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.492" offset="4585305">There is paragraph 13 of the decree which says that the interim agreement remains in effect to the extent not inconsistent with the decree, but it would be inconsistent with the provisions of the decree requiring accounting and payment if the interim agreement provided otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.249" offset="4668374">It does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.606" offset="4673808">It was not then understood to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.633" offset="4693870">When that decree was entered, it must be clear that all parties believed the accounting obligation had finally come to fruition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.398" offset="4736920">Now, when we look at the agreement itself, we derive no different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.990" offset="4771297">Of course, the agreement can't possibly excuse the failure to pay monies in Zone 2 or monies derived before the agreement was ever entered into, even though those were resisted presumably on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.188" offset="4828139">But as to the '56 and '75 monies, the text of the agreement is very clear that there is no waiver of any rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.627" offset="4861889">It is a working agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.741" offset="4866382">It is a modus vivendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.464" offset="4877249">It was deliberately tailored so as to avoid either parties giving up anything permanently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.635" offset="4905880">Louisiana could administer, Louisiana could enjoy for the time being revenues and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.488" offset="4941302">As I have already indicated, it would not have made sense for us to retain our claim to title in this area and waive our right to revenues in the area at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.077" offset="4991666">That would have been nothing more than an incentive for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.301" offset="5012564">Nor did either party so understand the agreement as Louisiana now maintains if we look at how they behaved afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.073" offset="5047672">Louisiana repeatedly consented to the entry of decrees which strictly speaking foreclosed its argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.559" offset="5085602">Indeed, in 1966 when it filed an account, in 1975 when it filed an account, it admitted an obligation to pay some of these revenues which it now denies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.428" offset="5141086">Now, the Master stressed a quite different point which was a provision of the Outer Continental Shelf Act; that provision is to the effect that when payments are made pursuant to an agreement with the state, the payments by the lessee to the state shall be taken as compliance with what would otherwise be the requirement of payments to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.855" offset="5246830">It seems to us perfectly plain on the face of the statute that what that means is no more than that the lessee is not in default while he is paying, as the United States has agreed with Louisiana, he may pay the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.665" offset="5310046">It in no way excuses the state from refunding that money when it is determined that the area was a federal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.970" offset="5359261">Finally, Louisiana makes the novel argument that they didn't really lease our lands, and they give you a diagram which suggests that in most instances a little sliver turned out to be federal, but most of the lease was really state lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.690" offset="5438151">That is very deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.199" offset="5448182">First of all, there are many cases in which 90 percent, 50 percent or a larger portion of the lease was federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.078" offset="5483708">There are indeed 145 leases in which the entire area described in the lease turned out to be federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.567" offset="5521638">In those circumstances, to say that the monies are not attributable to the federal area is an argument that I don't suppose Louisiana would advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.728" offset="5574301">And yet can the result turn on whether it is 10 percent of the lease area or 50 percent or 100 percent, or can it turn on whether there was actual drilling, because Louisiana concedes that the lion's share of the money we are talking about, some $12 million, derives from royalties directly received from the portion of the lease that is federally owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.059" offset="5699584">In that case, it can hardly be said that the money does not derive, in the words of the decree, from the federal lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.253" offset="5796342">There was, of course, a surface symmetry to Louisiana's conceding what they weren't claiming, but it hardly seems a quid pro quo.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.842" offset="5854751">Here, of course, the Master ruled with the United States and we entirely endorse the reasoning of this report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.673" offset="5890069">He addressed both of Louisiana's arguments, somewhat inconsistent but never mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.922" offset="5915042">The first was that the United States had a duty to invest these funds and, having failed to do so, it must in equity be held to the consequence if it had done what it was obliged to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.771" offset="5978467">As to that, the Master said, in our view entirely correctly, that indisputably -- these are his words -- the interim agreement does not specifically provide for the payment of interest upon any part of the funds impounded pursuant to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.177" offset="6100093">And indeed Louisiana, for all present purposes, I think concedes that that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.982" offset="6127261">But, they say, there was a tacit understanding that the United States would some time or other invest the funds, to which the Master answers, the evidence in this case clearly negatives any such understanding upon the part of the parties to the interim agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.474" offset="6325269">Now, Louisiana further says we unjustly enriched ourselves because we didn't do what the agreement required which was to segregate the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.316" offset="6360586">The Master said, incontrovertibly, it seems to us, the Treasury does not keep money or cash in an office safe, obviously the cash is going to be freely used in the same way that a bank uses the depositor's money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.603" offset="6421817">It must keep a strict account, it must put it down as potential liability, so when the day comes that money will be available without a congressional appropriation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.138" offset="6579911">You have come to the end almost of a long, long day and we in Louisiana are trying to come to the end of long, long lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.564" offset="6621602">And if I may for just a moment, I would like to bring you back to the story that happened because you must know the facts to have a feel for it, you can't feel for it by the academic expressions that are contained in these briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.676" offset="6694118">In 1956, the United States of America filed suit in this Court to stop all leasing out in the Gulf off Louisiana's coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.747" offset="6750333">Now, between 1947 and 1956, and industry had begun to build, and fellows who were fishermen became skippers on boats bringing people out to the rigs, and we brought people from Texas and Alabama and Mississippi who want to work in the shipyards building rigs for the Outer Continental Shelf development, and this industry was beginning to burgeon in 1956 when the United States governments comes to this Court and says let's stop all this leasing because Louisiana is actually leasing on some land that belongs to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.791" offset="6902575">This Court issued an injunction and that injunction literally brought the economy of south Louisiana to a standstill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.512" offset="6945416">People couldn't go to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.256" offset="6952417">They stopped building the rigs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.649" offset="6961925">They didn't know what they were going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.542" offset="6969553">The economy was faced with a possible discretion, so Louisiana runs up to the Department of the Interior and says, look, we've got to do something to get this business going again, you're throwing people out of work, you're depriving us of income, it's going to hurt a lot of good people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.174" offset="7048025">So the government says, well, I will tell you what we'll do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.882" offset="7062862">The then Secretary of the Interior took a pencil and he figured out what was the most shoreward line that could possibly be the coast of Louisiana and he drew that line, and it is called the Chapman line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.317" offset="7116675">And after he drew that line, he said I will tell you what we will do, the Submerged Lands Act gives you three miles out from the Chapman line by law and we will let you administer what the law gives you, and you can hold those proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.407" offset="7181040">Then they said from that three miles to the next three miles, and three miles beyond that, we are going to keep the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.195" offset="7212178">Do you think Louisiana could argue about it? Do you think this is an arm's length agreement where two parties are sitting down like in a free discussion?</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.168" offset="7252093">Louisiana was forced to accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.662" offset="7258049">They said, okay, you keep the money that you derive from that area, and when you find out whose money it is, we want you to give it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.164" offset="7295979">And then the United States says and we believe everything beyond that nine miles, which they call Zone 4, is ours, so we won't impound that, we will hold it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.992" offset="7339342">So everybody to those discussions called that agreement an escrow agreement, and they wrote in the agreement that the government would impound and hold intact those funds until it was decided who they really belonged to and then pay out from those impounded funds the money that belonged to Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.557" offset="7441638">Now, what Louisiana's position is, that that contract itself is pure and simply a trust agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.154" offset="7483956">Not once is the word "trust" used in the contract, but that is the simple reason that the law that authorized the writing of that contract used the word "impound" so the government, in its carefulness, traced the law and used the word "impound."</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.202" offset="7552188">But for nineteen years the United States government has held money that belongs to the State of Louisiana, and it turns out that for nineteen years it used that money and it saved the cost of borrowing for nineteen years, and instead of impounding and holding it intact like an ordinary escrow agent is obliged to do under law, they used the money.</text>

            <text syncTime="2141.999" offset="8671378">Now, the Master gives only two factual points in support of his conclusion that the agreement itself doesn't impliedly require investment at interest for the benefit of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.396" offset="8740968">And those two reasons are, one, he says the subject was never discussed, and that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.501" offset="8769390">It wasn't discussed whether the United States would pay interest and it wasn't discussed whether they would not pay interest; neither side brought it up.</text>

            <text syncTime="2197.492" offset="8893315">Well, first of all, that is a subjective consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.162" offset="8903973">But he doesn't report to it is Court the rest of what they thought.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.766" offset="13482402">I would like to point out too that if there is broad language of the decree, indeed there is, that sums derived -- and this is the position of the United States -- that all sums derived from mineral leasing or from mineral resources from property belonging to the other government should be paid to the other government, then, Your Honors, I submit that the very reasoning of the United States on the Zone 1 claim sustains the claim of Louisiana to the sums of money derived from the natural resources of Louisiana through financial benefits enjoyed by the United States through the use of the mineral leasing revenue of Louisiana, and that this Court has already adjudicated that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.650" offset="13706010">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.419" offset="13713011">I think I can be very brief and use less than that allotted time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.866" offset="13730879">One, two answers to questions asked by the Court with respect to the interest issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.670" offset="13754075">It should be known that Louisiana received monthly reports from 1956 to date indicating precisely how much money was impounded in the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.621" offset="13805902">Those reports very clearly reflected during all that period that no interest or other increment was being added to the fund, therefore no question of surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.219" offset="13844250">Secondly, in 1960, four years after the agreement had been in effect, Louisiana's congressional delegation, both Senate and all members of the House, the Attorney General of Louisiana and the legislature of Louisiana concurred in requesting not that the funds be invested, not that interest be paid, but that the monies in the Treasury be transferred to Louisiana banks so that they could enjoy the free use of that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.834" offset="13962742">That request was denied on the ground that it would set an unfortunate precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.219" offset="13988237">Then Louisiana received its $34 million in 1966, no complaint about the failure to add interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.836" offset="14026689">In 1967, the Louisiana legislature, as represented, did memorialize federal officials to hence forward -- not for the past -- please respectfully request is their language, invest these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.195" offset="14096175">No claim that there was a duty to invest, no claim that they had a right to interest for the sums they had just been paid, but simply a request to change the agreement for the future, in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.134" offset="14147897">The Fiscal Assistant Secretary of the Treasury responded that Treasury regulations forbid him from making any such investment in the absence of statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.328" offset="14200665">It may be that the '56 agreement could have been amended to so provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.225" offset="14224280">Louisiana did not suggest it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.690" offset="14234102">They didn't take the matter further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.277" offset="14244446">They never said another thing about it until 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.825" offset="14262627">Now, they could have asked for an amendments of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.257" offset="14276420">Or if the duty already arose under the '56 agreement, obviously they could have come to this Court and said we will not accept the response by federal officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="3560.830" offset="14346742">Suppose there had been statutory authority available to the fiscal officer to invest the money and he went out and invested it and interest was earned on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3581.255" offset="14428348">That might properly be viewed as an implied amendment of the agreement done at the request of Louisiana, the acquiescence of the United States with respect to monies held under the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3597.901" offset="14495013">Well, in these circumstances I don't, think we would owe interest because the agreement doesn't provide for it, but there would be an equitable claim that we should have some of the benefit of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3631.126" offset="14627924">It was part of the bargain that Louisiana would enjoy these revenues until such time as they lost the land, if that day should come.</text>
