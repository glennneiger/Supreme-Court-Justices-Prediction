            <text syncTime="88.219" offset="456286">Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.945" offset="475199">We are here for a second time on a petition for certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and for the second time that court has placed its District Court on a collision course with the District Court for Delaware and with the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.120" offset="563806">The petitioners here are twelve television manufacturers which furnished information to the Consumer Product Safety Commission with respect to television related accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.455" offset="617200">The respondents are prominent consumer groups who have sought access to that data.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.286" offset="648547">In early '75, the Commission notified all interested parties that it was prepared to release the data, and shortly thereafter the twelve manufacturers brought suit in four District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.646" offset="722004">Most of the suits were brought in the Delaware District Court; the balance were brought in other District Courts not in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.064" offset="783653">Temporary restraining orders were promptly obtained and the non-Delaware cases were transferred to Delaware with consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.945" offset="831195">In May '75, about two weeks after the manufacturers filed their suits, the requesters brought a suit in the District of Columbia against the Consumer Product Safety Commission and joined the manufacturers as defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.551" offset="901622">The District of Columbia suit was fairly promptly dismissed by Judge Ritchey in September of '75.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.541" offset="933491">He found a lack of a case of controversy between the requesters and the agency because the agency stood quite willing to release the documents when not enjoined from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.674" offset="994095">And he found a failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted as against the manufacturers because no documents were being sought from the manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.557" offset="1045608">In October '75, Chief Judge Latchum entered a preliminary injunction in the Delaware case.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.882" offset="1082911">He --</text>

            <text syncTime="245.011" offset="1083434">Mr. Shniderman, since so much of this case seems to depend on procedural history and so forth, was the theory of your case in Delaware solely a reverse FOIA case or was it partly a Chrysler-type case that there was some protection given to providers that couldn't be furnished regardless of whether an agency wanted to or not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_l_shniderman" startTime="272.879" stopTime="280.618">

            <text syncTime="272.879" offset="1194924">Well, it was really a -- I guess in view of Chrysler, it is clear that a reverse FOIA case is really --</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry L. Shniderman</label>
            <text syncTime="281.371" offset="1228884">-- there is no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.372" offset="1232854">It is a very convenient shorthand way of describing the Chrysler kind of suit, and that is what basically we have and basically what the Third Circuit ultimately found that we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.561" offset="1289592">In any event, Judge Latchum found that section 6(b)(1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act barred disclosure of the requested data and he entered a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.415" offset="1349047">Now, Judge Ritchie had explicitly noted that in his opinion it would be appropriate for the requesters to seek to intervene in Delaware but they did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.978" offset="1395336">Instead they appealed, as they had a right to do, to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.997" offset="1423339">In July of '77, approximately ten months after oral argument, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed the decision below and directed the case to proceed on the merits, in spite of the Delaware preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.951" offset="1499199">This Court granted certiorari, summarily vacated the judgment below, and it remanded the case for reconsideration by the court below because by that time there had been a permanent injunction which had been entered by the Delaware court.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.299" offset="1592613">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reconsidered the matter and ultimately reaffirmed its decision and hence we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.949" offset="1635140">In April, in the meantime, in April of '79, the Third Circuit affirmed Judge Latchum's decision on the permanent injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.426" offset="1677040">Now, in that proceeding the respondents in this case appeared as amicus curiae on a procedural issue, and the Consumer Federation of America, of which at least one requester is a member, appeared as an amicus on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.108" offset="1759796">The Delaware case thus is final except for a pending petition for certiorari filed by the agency in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.628" offset="1805876">Now, the court below in this case first found that there was a case of controversy with respect to the effect of the then preliminary and final judgment, the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.772" offset="1870451">Second, it failed to find, failed to discuss the argument that had been made by both the agency and by us that there had not been an improper withholding of the documents within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act because the agency was willing to produce the documents but was enjoined from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.362" offset="1968776">And third, it concluded that neither principles of comity nor collateral estoppel preclude the District of Columbia from going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.332" offset="2024678">Indeed, in its second opinion the District of Columbia Court advised and directed the trial court to consider whether it may enjoin the manufacturers from enforcing the injunction in Delaware in the event the injunction were disobeyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.035" offset="2111509">And it also commented on class action opportunities for joining all requesters, a technique which had been espoused by neither side and to this day is not espoused by either side.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.678" offset="2182040">We rely on three wholly independent arguments for urging reversal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.128" offset="2211924">The first ground is quite simple and it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.403" offset="2233031">The Freedom of Information Act, in section 552(a)(4)(b), provides a requester with access to a District Court which is given jurisdiction, in the words of the statute, to order the production of any agency records -- and here are the key words -- improperly withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.727" offset="2342327">We have here a permanent injunction which bars disclosure of the records which the agency would willingly produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.446" offset="2377122">It is a sufficient basis for this Court to dispose of this case in its entirety simply to rule that the documents are not improperly withheld in the circumstances when the agency is permanently or indeed temporarily enjoined from producing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.960" offset="2459251">The injunction must obviously be obeyed unless or until it is vacated.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="594.454" offset="2481194">We would have to say, I suppose, that the requesters had a right to intervene in the Delaware action and to appeal the injunction against disclosure?</text>

            <text syncTime="611.691" offset="2550157">That is something that this Court would have to decide, whether they have waived that right or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.250" offset="2592371">Of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.097" offset="2595715">Of course, certainly and they had every opportunity to do so at all levels, as I would point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.340" offset="2632704">Now, the entire orientation of this act -- and I am talking about the Freedom of Information Act now -- is to restrict unbridled administrative decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.912" offset="2687039">No one before has ever suggested that the agency is required to defy court orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.217" offset="2720266">The act is directed at agency conduct, it is not directed at courts, it is not directed at court restraining orders blocking record production.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.784" offset="2786513">In Chrysler, this Court recognized that a submitter of documents has a right to sue to restrain production of those documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.137" offset="2831966">Now, if a suit is authorized, it obviously has a prospect of success, and this means the prospect that there will be a restraint on the agency, and such a court restraint on an agency cannot be translated into an improper agency withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.629" offset="2917857">There are ways of vacating or modifying a decree but only the issuing court can do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.108" offset="2943770">Never a moment in time has there been since this case in the District of Columbia has been instituted when the agency was not under temporary or permanent restraint from producing those documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="755.966" offset="3127254">And, Mr. Chief Justice, it is very common in the reverse situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.172" offset="3140106">There are many cases on the books where an agency has refused to produce documents and a requester has brought suit in some court where the submitter has intervened to help bolster the position of the government and make whatever arguments it thought was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.396" offset="3212936">That has been very common.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.001" offset="3223385">The requesters would have this Court consider this case as if there had never been any restraining order in effect, but that is not our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.637" offset="3265912">And it is equally significant, I submit, that the requesters in their brief never take a position whatsoever as to what ought to be done, what ought to be done with this case now that there is a permanent injunction in place, and yet that is our case.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="808.719" offset="3338219">Well, under your position, you would almost have to take the opposite position if they had first filed an action under the Freedom of Information Act before your clients had filed an action for an injunction against disclosure, wouldn't you, if you rely on comity?</text>

            <text syncTime="830.189" offset="3424110">But in all candor, when the decision is that the agency will release the documents, it is usually going to be the submitter of the documents that will bring the suit first.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.215" offset="3476250">And when the decision is not to release the documents, it will be the requester who will bring the suit first.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="851.501" offset="3509373">The agencies have set up internal procedures whereby they notify in advance, don't they, at least that was true in Chrysler, that the Secretary of Defense notify Chrysler ten days in advance that he is going to release them in case Chrysler wanted to do anything about it?</text>

            <text syncTime="867.138" offset="3571963">Yes, of course, and because a party who is going to get what he asked for really has no cause of action and that comes to a second point as to whether there is a case of controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.018" offset="3611460">He has no basis for suing if the agency says I am going to give you these documents tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.669" offset="3634030">So we come to the second ground, the second quite independent ground, and that is comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.082" offset="3671751">We submit that sound principles of judicial administration really require that deference be given to a sister court which has first seized hold of a lawsuit and is in the process of adjudicating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.630" offset="3749909">Unfortunately, we witness here an almost deliberate effort to cause a collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.186" offset="3776136">It is very unfortunate, but I must say to cause duplicative litigation, because I think the Court of Appeals preferred its own court, and yet it is, as I have said, quite natural for the plaintiff to select its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.400" offset="3832978">The suggestion has been made that comity principles apply, as is the suggestion of the court below, only when all the parties in the second suit are parties to the first, but there is no such rule and we certainly urge that this Court not to construct such a rule when there is, Justice Rehnquist, an opportunity to intervene in the Delaware District Court, if there is a feeling that the government will be an adequate representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.359" offset="3952828">Or the respondents could have intervened here in the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.384" offset="3972890">And when they moved to appear as amicus on a procedural issue, we opposed their appearing on that basis and said in our same paper that we would have no objection even at that late date if they were to intervene at the Third Circuit level.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.480" offset="4041331">So certainly where we do not have a recalcitrant agency in this case, we do not think that the Freedom of Information Act provides a basis for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.881" offset="4086888">What we do have here is that the manufacturers have a strong statutory basis in 1391(e) for bringing a suit in a locality where it resides, a very strong government policy dating back to 1962.</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.581" offset="4621667">The federal respondents in this case are in basic agreement with the petitioners that the D.C. Circuit erred in ordering the District of Columbia District Court to adjudicate essentially the same controversy with the same documents and the same legal issues as that involved in the already pending Delaware litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.459" offset="4697213">The principal concern of the federal government in this area, however, is not to urge this Court to adopt rules, procedural rules that favor FOIA requesters or submitters, but rather to urge the Court to adopt procedural rules to insure that federal agencies are not put in a position where they are subject to inconsistent and perhaps even irreconcilable injunctive orders of different federal courts, with one court requiring the agency to turn over to the public certain records whose disclosure another court has enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.998" offset="4839320">Now, this problem is unlikely to arise when the first suit brought is an action by a requester under the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.330" offset="4864711">In those circumstances, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has mentioned, the practice has generally been for the agency to notify the submitter of the pendency of the FOIA request or of a legal action if one has been filed, and to give it the opportunity to intervene if it believes that its interests are not adequately protected by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.399" offset="4948929">The more significant problem, however, which is clearly illustrated by this case occurs when the first suit brought is a so-called reverse FOIA action by a submitter of information to the government and when the submitter obtains an injunction prohibiting the agency from disclosing the records in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.509" offset="5021445">The federal government's view is that a second District Court in a suit subsequently brought by an FOIA requester should not proceed to adjudicate the disclosability of the very same documents that are the subject of the first suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.224" offset="5260309">That's right, and here there are allegations that the Trade Secrets Act and section 6(b)(1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act prohibited the agency from disclosing the television accident reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.262" offset="5308374">Now, the first and most obvious reason why we think that the D.C. Circuit should not have ordered the District Court to continue to take this case is one that Mr. Shniderman has already touched on, but I want to emphasize it because of its obvious importance to this case, and that is the very language of the FOIA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.351" offset="5372740">Section 552(a)(4)(B) empowers the District Court to order the disclosure of agency records that are being "improperly withheld under the FOIA."</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.868" offset="5414849">And we agree with the petitioners that an agency's obedience to a federal court order can in no sense be regarded as improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.509" offset="5445360">The Consumer Product Safety Commission believes that the injunctive order that was issued in Delaware is based on an erroneous interpretation of the law and it has appealed that injunction to the Third Circuit and it has now filed a certiorari petition in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.663" offset="5506069">But the commission is bound to obey the injunction until and unless it is set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.141" offset="5523937">We simply don't understand -- and the D.C. Circuit, as I said a moment ago, didn't bother to explain -- how the agency could have "improperly withheld" television accident reports from the requesters when it refused to turn over those documents solely because of the outstanding Delaware injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.722" offset="5594258">The requesters never addressed this issue in their brief and they never explained what the Commission is supposed to do if it is subjected to inconsistent injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.156" offset="5631979">Now, along with the petitioners, the government also believes that the D.C. Circuit's decision is wrong for yet another somewhat broader reason, and that is that it violates fundamental principles of judicial comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.737" offset="5678268">The Court has often applied the general rule that a federal court should refrain from duplicating or interfering with the proceedings --</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="1431.492" offset="5829360">But we think in the FOIA area there is a strong analogy to be drawn to cases involving in rem or quasi-in rem jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.774" offset="5858513">In such cases, this Court has made clear that the second court in which an action is filed must always defer to the court first asserting jurisdiction, not as a matter of discretion but as a matter of absolute necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.339" offset="5908773">So the Court of Appeals in this case itself recognized that actions seeking to require or to prohibit the disclosure of copies of specific documents are in many ways indistinguishable from actions seeking the particular disposition of a specific piece of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.545" offset="5973556">In both types of cases, exclusive control over the property is essential to effectuate the court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.802" offset="5998529">It is obvious that an injunction preventing release of certain information is absolutely useless unless it prevents agency action everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.665" offset="6034056">And by the same token, an order requiring disclosure of information obviously can't be limited to a single jurisdiction and would forever foreclose a subsequent non-disclosure order from ever being effected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.368" offset="6084838">In short, FOIA claims or reverse FOIA claims, when they concern the same agency records, we believe must be adjudicated in one and not multiple jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.492" offset="6137292">And we believe that it makes the most sense from the standpoint of judicial administration to centralize that litigation in the first court to assume jurisdiction, subject, of course, to that court's further order transferring the case to some other district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.837" offset="6194761">Now, the Court of Appeals candidly acknowledged that its decision would require duplicate of litigation, but it felt that that result was justified in this case for a number of reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.627" offset="6261844">That was the reason that they did not offer, but they offered several others which we think are equally meritless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.287" offset="6280547">We discussed them in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.756" offset="6290369">The only point I want to make about the D.C. Circuit's approach, its so-called creative approach or flexible approach, as the requesters call it, is that it totally fails to offer a satisfactory solution to what we believe is the most pressing problem in this area, which is the very real possibility that a federal agency may be subject to conflicting injunctive orders of two separate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.636" offset="6381902">The procedural device is, what the D.C. Circuit said is, "We're not going to require that the litigation be centralized in the first court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.040" offset="6407502">It can proceed wherever the FOIA action is filed, despite the pendency of another case, and there are a number of procedural devices that can be used to try to consolidate the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.940" offset="6447104">But the problem with that approach is that the procedural devices that the Court of Appeals would rely on, such as Section 1404(A) of Title 28, Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, while they may be useful in some cases to accomplish a consolidation clearly can't be used in every case, and then you are left with the specter of possibly conflicting inconsistent injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.169" offset="6540100">For example, Section 1404 only allows transfer to a district in which the case could originally have been brought, and Rule 19 often can't be used to bring a non-party into a law suit because of venue or service of process problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.106" offset="6603839">And perhaps more important, the principal defect in the D.C. Circuit's approach is that it relies heavily on procedural devices that we submit are simply ill-suited to FOIA litigation, where a plaintiff need not have any legal basis or any legal interest in the documents that he requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.248" offset="6684400">For example, the Court of Appeals suggestion that FOIA submitters or federal agencies should make use of the so called requester class action is totally unworkable in practice because every person in the United States, indeed I suppose every person in the world, is a member of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.773" offset="6750438">Anybody can make a request under the FOIA, and I might add it's significant, we think, as Mr. Shniderman said, that the requesters in this case have abandoned any reliance on that portion of the Court of Appeals' opinion in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.493" offset="6805295">Moreover, if in fact the commission had attempted join these requesters in the Delaware litigation under Rule 19, as the D.C. Circuit later said they should have attempted, tactic would have been of little practical value in avoiding duplicate of litigation or inconsistent judgments, because even if the commission could have succeeded in joining the requesters, and the answer to that question is far from clear in light of the venue and service of process problems that I mentioned a moment ago, all that would have been accomplished is that these two particular requesters would have been bound by the collateral estoppel effect of the Delaware judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.399" offset="6952939">However, anyone in the United States would still have been free to file an FOIA action in the District of Columbia seeking access to the very same documents, and under the D.C. Circuit's theory, since these new requesters would not have been parties to or bound by the Delaware litigation, they would have had a right to continue to litigate and to receive an adjudication of their FOIA claim in the District of Columbia, despite the existence of the Delaware injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.103" offset="7063803">So we think that this so-called flexible approach just won't work in a substantial number of cases, and could lead to what we believe is the most important problem in this area, one that the Court I think should be concerned about in resolving the issue, which is the very real possibility that exists in this case and these types of cases of an agency having to either comply with an order requiring or an order prohibiting disclosure of the precisely the same document on pain of contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2122.880" offset="8594892">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.587" offset="8609729">Virtually from the start of this litigation, the petitioners and the government have opposed the efforts of the requesting parties under the Freedom of Information Act to litigate this case in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.471" offset="8661243">They have consistently asked why didn't you go to Delaware?</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.684" offset="8678066">And I want to answer that question today in three separate ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.009" offset="8695411">We didn't go to Delaware for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.995" offset="8707323">First, we didn't want to go to Delaware; second, we didn't have to go to Delaware; and, third, it is the wrong question to ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.092" offset="8743790">And the proper question to ask is why didn't the parties, and in particular the government, move to take the cases in Delaware and bring them down to the District of Columbia where everybody was here, the case could have gone forward for judgment on the merits in one court, this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.947" offset="8811186">Now, bluntly stated, this case involves forum shopping by all the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.754" offset="8834382">There is nothing inherently evil in forum shopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.265" offset="8848384">Congress has provided alternate venue provisions and they are there to be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.867" offset="8870849">The manufacturers went to Delaware because they believed it would be favorable to then to go to Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.142" offset="8895927">It is not, of course, the principal place of business of any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.897" offset="8910973">In fact, four lawsuits were not even filed in Delaware, they were filed elsewhere and later transferred to Delaware.</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.738" offset="8938350">Isn't that usually a reason for venuing a case, though, counsel?</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="2213.411" offset="8957053">Absolutely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.770" offset="8962487">And my point is that, like saying this is a forum shopping case, we don't decide anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.690" offset="8994147">The manufacturers were there in Delaware, despite the absence of any witnesses, despite the absence of land counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.461" offset="9017240">The documents weren't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.830" offset="9022673">They were merely incorporated in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.312" offset="9032600">We wanted to avoid Delaware for our own reasons, because we believed it was inconvenient and because it was more costly to litigate here in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.927" offset="9071052">The clients would here, the counsel was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.429" offset="9081083">We considered going up to Delaware and moving to intervene in Delaware and attempting to have the case transferred here under 1404(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.404" offset="9117027">But as soon as we thought about that, we saw we were in a box because there are cases that have held that if you voluntarily come into an action as an intervenor you waive your right to go to ask that the case be transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.058" offset="9167600">So we were put in a bind because they had run the race to the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.886" offset="9190902">Indeed, we couldn't have gone to Delaware only at the time of filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.558" offset="9205635">We would have had to have gone to the District of Delaware, the Western District of Pennsylvania, and we would have had to have gone to the Western District of New York and the Southern District of New York to litigate a single controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.534" offset="9253491">Now, we also perceived that the action in the District of Columbia would be more favorably disposed of here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.867" offset="9278882">Presumably the manufacturers thought the contrary for they went to Delaware and the general reputation of the courts is at least a matter that counsel believed they ought to consider in their obligations to their clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.314" offset="9328619">Moreover, there had been temporary restraining orders already entered in those other cases and it was a negative footing on which to settle the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.624" offset="9365817">The result is that we would have been faced with the situation at the time we filed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.435" offset="9385148">I want to emphasize that this was four days after the May 1st self-imposed deadline by the Court of Appeals by the Product Safety Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.424" offset="9421093">Four days after that, we did the simplest thing, we filed one case here in the District of Columbia and, unlike the manufacturers, we named every single person who was relevant in the controversy and tried to get them all in a single forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.095" offset="9483786">So that is why we didn't want to go to Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.117" offset="9495803">And as counsel, I must tell you that I am obligated to represent my clients to the best I can.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.385" offset="13500897">Your Honor, this race to the courthouse theory which has been put forth is going to produce unnecessary and premature litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.468" offset="13529213">It is going to produce an unnecessary interruption of the administrative process as parties are racing to the courthouse to get their choice of forum so that everything can be consolidated there because they are going to win, and it provides an absolute choice of forum to one side or the other without regard to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.075" offset="13595669">We don't think that is a sensible way of dealing with it, but if that is what the Court says we believe we can live with it in the first case, and we are here today because we agree with the Solicitor General that there is a problem with judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.487" offset="13649272">We agree that it is desirable to have proceedings consolidated in one forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.644" offset="13669961">We disagree that the race to the courthouse with one side a guaranteed winner and the other side a guaranteed loser as a sensible way of resolving that conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.224" offset="13704234">What we urge is that the flexibility entailed in Rule 19 and 1404(a) be used to solve the problems in virtually every case and that we don't think there are significant problems that cannot be worked out through them.</text>

Birmingham, I would also like to say that in our brief we point to the United Mine Workers case where John L. Lewis made a mistake as to whether an injunction was binding or not and it cost his union $1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.849" offset="14090742">So I would think that injunctions are to be obeyed until such time as they were set aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="3511.445" offset="14149151">Part of the difficulty that we get in here is because we really did not have a case of controversy in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.732" offset="14178304">The government now states that there is a case of controversy as to the scope or the effect of the injunction.</text>
