            <text syncTime="91.187" offset="468093">The instant case involves three participants, one an innocent 14-year-old--or 15-year-old girl; the other a hopelessly and terrible sexual psychopath; and the third, his legal guardian, state parole officials of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.684" offset="546147">The two former individuals' paths crossed in Tecolote Canyon, San Diego, California, in August of 1975, and Mary Ellen Martinez came away the Loser, for she was brutally murdered by June-Jordan Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.544" offset="613543">Thomas, on the other hand, was returned to the place from which he never should have been released, the State prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.561" offset="641651">Indeed, had this been a case of owners of a dangerous animal who allowed that animal to get loose and do injury, we would have long since had a verdict favorable to our clients in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.396" offset="701001">This individual was released in spite of the fact that in 1969 he terrorized young females of the same age category that Mary Ellen was in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.966" offset="5955271">The Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Ninth Circuits have all unanimously held that there's an absolute quasi-judicial immunity which attaches to a parole official in connection with his determination to release a prisoner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.918" offset="6023084">We've cited in our brief numerous opinions issued by the Federal district courts for the same proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.998" offset="6047326">We've quoted extensively from the cases of Wright v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Pate v. Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.107" offset="6083793">In both of those cases the question of Section 1983 immunity for parole officials was placed in issue as a result of a parolee being released into society and either killing or seriously injuring a member of the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.354" offset="6136769">And in both of those cases the absolute quasi-judicial immunity was held to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.386" offset="6164877">Against that rather unanimous backdrop of application and recognition of the quasi-judicial immunity for parole officials for a determination to release a parolee into society, the appellants have been able to cite only two cases, namely the cases of Grimm v. Arizona Board of Pardons and Paroles, and Semler v. Psychiatric Institution of Washington, D.C. Semler was cited by amicus on behalf of appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.425" offset="6273024">We would submit that neither one of those cases is relevant to the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.943" offset="6299146">In Grimm the Arizona Supreme Court chose that as a vehicle to abolish what had previously existed as a common law rule in Arizona immunizing all discretionary--all administrative officials in connection with discretionary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.409" offset="6361004">Rather than engaging in an analysis of the common law history of quasi-judicial immunity accorded parole officials, rather than determining the public policy considerations in favor of that immunity, the court based its decision solely on the question of, in what branch of government the position of, quote, parole official, reposed in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.995" offset="6463404">And finding that it reposed in the executive or administrative branch, it held that therefore judicial immunity, or quasi-judicial immunity could not attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.916" offset="6507081">In the case of--well, it comes as no surprise to us that the majority opinion in Grimm was mocked by the dissent and has not been followed by any other jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.672" offset="6550026">In Semler v. Psychiatric Institute, cited by amicus in support of the appellants, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a probation officer could be liable under Virginia common law in connection with a ministerial act of negligence consisting of participating in the transference of a dangerous mental patient from a high-risk, high-security facility to a facility of lesser security.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.600" offset="6861824">After--after an inquiry into the judicial history of the immunity accorded the relevant public official, we must engage in an analysis of the public policy considerations in favor of applying an immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.524" offset="6909471">And before engaging in a parity of reasoning between quasi-judicial immunity on the part of judges and prosecutors, which this Court has recognized in cases we cited in our brief, I'd like to make a few remarks concerning the unique discretionary nature of the parole process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.824" offset="6978644">This Court, in 1972, in the case of Morrissey v. Brewer, indicated that for the past 60 years the process of releasing prisoners on parole had become an integral part of our penological system; that the purpose of parole is to reintegrate officials into society as constructive individuals as soon as they are able, without confining them for the terms of the sentence imposed, and that the process of parole mitigates the cost to society of keeping people incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.640" offset="7085955">In the recent case of Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, decided May 31st of this year, this Court painted a very comprehensive picture of the unique and discretionary nature of the parole process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.248" offset="7148335">The Court all but implied it's a fragile process, still in the experimental stage, and it consists of a synthesis of record fact and personal observation of the parole official, filtered through the sum total of his experience, and resulting in an equity type of judgment, taking into account psychological, sociological, biological and genetic factors of the individual under consideration; and that that kind of decision does not always lend itself to traditional finding of fact or conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.466" offset="7261288">It emphasizes not what a man has done, but what a man is and what a man can become.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.239" offset="7284276">And it's against--it's against that backdrop, that critical and unique purpose of parole, that we must engage in an inquiry of the public policy considerations in favor of granting quasi-judicial immunity to parole officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.667" offset="7366092">In 1967, this Court, in one of its cases, recognized the common law immunity which benefitted judges from civil liability in connection with the 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.211" offset="7428263">That was Pierson v. Ray.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.638" offset="7433906">And in 1976, in the landmark case of Imbler v. Pachtman, this Court extended that rule of immunity to State prosecutors upon the rationale that to permit angry or disgruntled litigants to file lawsuits against these officials alleging reckless or improper conduct would have a chilling effect on these decision-making processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.801" offset="7530559">And that chilling effect would result in harassment and intimidation, rather than fearless and principled decision-making.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.891" offset="7874957">And furthermore, with respect to that point, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in Semler, a Fourth Circuit opinion, the Court of Appeals in that case did not modify, nor even question, its own rule of absolute quasi-judicial immunity that it had already recognized in favor of parole officials in connection with a determination to release or to deny release, to a parolee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.072" offset="7987702">We believe there's a parity of reasoning between the public policy considerations in favor of prosecutors and judges and granting them immunity and granting a quasi-judicial immunity for parole officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.108" offset="8035767">As it was foreseeable on the part of--in the context of a state prosecutor that numerous lawsuits could be filed by unhappy litigants unable to accept the wisdom of the result of a particular case, we can perceive a multitude of lawsuits being filed by victims of violent crime committed by parolees who will transmute the loss, the shock, the wrath, and the other emotions they've suffered into ascriptions of reckless and improper conduct against a parole official, allegations that are easily made and, in the absence of a total quasi-judicial immunity, can only be disproven with a full evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.120" offset="8211832">That would deflect a great deal of energy and time on the part of parole officials from making these important decisions to defending past decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.609" offset="8249762">And in some cases, decisions that have taken place years before they will have to come into court and establish to the satisfaction of a jury good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.103" offset="8295737">That imposes an intolerable burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.357" offset="8308799">Furthermore, the Court indicated in Imbler that it would be highly improper and risky to permit lay juries to pass on technical issues such as prosecutorial strategy of what witnesses to call, what evidence to seek introduction of, what kind of a case to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.154" offset="8384031">We feel there's a parity of reasoning there because if we were to open up the door even a crack to liability on the part of parole officials under 1983, juries would be expected to resolve issues such as the--all of the individualized and highly subjective issues which argue in favor of release for a particular individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="2651.650" offset="10709974">We feel that under that kind of pressure--we feel, in the initial case, that any prospect of liability under 1983 for the determination of a release of a prisoner, whether it comes from a member of the public victimized by a parolee, or from an inmate who has been denied parole, would create a chilling process--a chilling effect on the ability of the individuals to exercise the vast amount of discretion we repose in them for the purpose of vindicating this aspect of our penological system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.541" offset="10865560">We feel--getting back to the question of the incredible burden that we would impose on juries, we feel that juries would be presented with all kinds of highly technical and improper decisions for them to make, such as the predictability of violence in general terms, and also in specific terms with respect to a particular parolee; and that ultimately they would be required to come up with the ultimate finding of fact, in the form of a jury verdict, a process which this Court has already acknowledged is not appropriate for the kind of determination that a parole official will have to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.063" offset="11035669">These decisions will be made in an emotional melting pot, with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight; and it'll be easy for a jury to ascribe reckless conduct or improper conduct on the part of a parole official in an emotional reaction to the gravity of the offense that was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.965" offset="11111215">So our position is that we should not--we should not submit parole officials to make this treacherous choice of opting for continued confinement for their own personal protection on the one hand, and opting for the release of an individual into society at the risk of incurring personal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.639" offset="11189896">We feel that that would have a chilling effect on this decision-making process, and result in thousands upon thousands of inmates throughout the penal institutions in our country worthy of parole being incarcerated longer for unjustifiable periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.134" offset="11271920">Furthermore, if we were to impose liability under Section 1983 in this particular set of circumstances, and appellants have argued that we should impose liability only for gross negligence or recklessness, we would in effect be creating a privileged class of crime victims, if you will those people victimized by recidivistic acts committed by parolees who have been released as a function of gross negligence or other grievous misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.895" offset="11406921">Crime victims who suffer at the hands of parolees who haven't been released as a result of any improprieties would have no redress under 1983, nor would people victimized by probationers, or first time criminals, for that matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.557" offset="11637635">In California, we've adopted a comprehensive scheme known as the Victim of Violent Crimes legislation, whereby we compensate, to a limited degree, and within the context of special damages suffered by individuals, victims of all crime, not just crime committed by released parolees or released probationers or first-time criminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.616" offset="11733870">Furthermore--and this gets into the area of what alternative means there are which might be preferable to Section 1983 in California at the time this happened, and at the present day, we can promptly remove a parole official who is incompetent or can't exercise his--the discretion that is reposed in him, or for any other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.721" offset="11818297">We can also reduce the amount of discretion that we vest in parole officials, and provide for a greater involvement of interested law enforcement agencies and, indeed, the public, as we've done in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.058" offset="11871587">There's been some suggestion that because of the absence of formalistic judicial safeguards the parole process is not--is--should be controlled by the imposition of tort liability upon parole officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.800" offset="11958523">And in their briefs the appellants made reference to the quasi-judicial--not the quasi-judicial, but the judicial safeguards enunciated by this Court in Butz v. Economou, and indicate that in the absence of that kind of safeguard liability should be imposed as a necessary check.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.603" offset="12041801">First of all, the Butz opinion itself did not impose as a condition precedent the existence of any judicial safeguards on the Federal administrative law process before it granted--before it decided it was to grant quasi-judicial immunity to administrative law judges and prosecuting attorneys within the executive branch of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.047" offset="12139604">And furthermore, as this Court has indicated in Stump, particularly in footnote 12 of Stump, there are all kinds of activities in which a judge may engage which are outside the adversarial process, such as the decision to issue a search warrant, or issue an ex parte order such as a temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.488" offset="12225285">And there are no procedural safeguards at that particular time, but we have still recognized absolute immunity in that kind of a context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.837" offset="12262693">Within the context of prosecutors, we will totally immunize them for many of their decisions which are ex parte, if you want to call it that, in nature, which are not made within the context of the adversary process, such as a decision of when to prosecute a case, what case to prosecute, what evidence to seek introduction of and what witnesses to call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.873" offset="12350882">Finally, we turn to the subject that the parole decision itself really does not lend itself to the adversary process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.564" offset="12381602">It's a quasi-judicial function outside the traditional mold of adjudication, as the Court indicated in Greenholtz, and there are all kinds of equitable, and intangible, and highly subjective factors to be taken into account, and the process results in an equity kind of predictive judgment, not a traditional finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.294" offset="12468537">It's been likened by this Court in Greenholtz to the sentencing judge's choice, and in Williams v. New York this Court held that in the context of sentencing there were no due process or other requirements which could justify the injection into a sentencing process of the right to counsel or formalistic rules of evidence; because if that were done, as the Court recognized in Williams, we would have a situation where judges would not be able to rely on information in which--upon which they traditionally rely for that important decision, such as probation reports and other information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.884" offset="12614928">The Court indicated that that kind of information won't normally come in under classic rules of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.425" offset="12641050">It furthermore will impose a great burden on--a great cost burden on society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.290" offset="12676577">My final remark with respect to appellant's contention that we need judicial safeguards in this area is that if we were to impose that kind of condition, we feel that it will be done at the risk of creating a greater self consciousness of the quasi-judicial function of the parole decision, which in and of itself could have a chilling effect on the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.842" offset="12762781">It could be transformed into a prosecutorial environment where the emphasis would not be placed upon rehabilitation of the individual but rather on continued and unjustified confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.144" offset="12851911">Thank you.</text>
