            <label>Mr. Jerome R. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="12.429" offset="153057">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.667" offset="178030">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.244" offset="192345">This is an appeal by Mobil Oil Corporation from a decision of the Vermont Supreme Court holding that dividends received by Mobil from its subsidiaries and affiliates which operated exclusively in foreign countries and derived virtually all their income from sources outside the United States, that such dividends were properly includable in the apportionable base of the Vermont tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.660" offset="297984">That's the only issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.349" offset="304776">Now, the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.038" offset="311568">Mobil is a New York corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.526" offset="321494">Its corporate headquarters and commercial domicile are located in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.860" offset="338840">It is engaged in all aspects of the petroleum business including exploration, production of oil and gas, refining, transportation, and sale of petroleum and petroleum products.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.336" offset="388681">Now, the only activities carried on in Vermont consisted of the wholesale and retail marketing of products.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.811" offset="426611">Mobile is subject to taxes measured by net income not only in the State of Vermont, but in 40 other States, as well as the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.695" offset="462137">The company is engaged in both interstate and foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.330" offset="480737">Now, with respect to these stocks, Mobil owned the stocks of a large number of corporations, subsidiaries and affiliates, and as I have said, they carried on their business solely in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.555" offset="533608">These dividends that are here in issue constituted most of Mobil's taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.278" offset="560462">Now, 99 percent of the dividends were derived from, received from corporations that derived all or all except a very insignificant portion of their income from sources outside the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.632" offset="613857">Mobil's business as the owner of these stocks was in all respects conducted outside Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.280" offset="644472">Managed, directed offices outside Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.744" offset="654399">The same is true of the dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.070" offset="659623">The receipt of the dividends and the disposition of the dividends, all outside --</text>

            <text syncTime="152.729" offset="714271">Under the theory we are presenting, something like $4,000 for the three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.550" offset="737573">I'd like to go to that, Your Honor, because the Commissioner has suggested that the tax of $4,000 for this great multinational company can hardly be a fair representation of what Mobil ought to pay for the activities carried on in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.523" offset="805491">Well, I think we ought to remember several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.276" offset="816462">The Vermont Legislature imposed an income tax, and when the Vermont Legislature imposed that income tax it knew perfectly well that that might result in a loss, even though we have a lot of property and assets in this state.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.033" offset="875499">The Commissioner, in making this very argument, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that you're making, $4,000 for this gargantuan company --</text>

            <text syncTime="204.680" offset="922102">It's a small amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.106" offset="927848">The other point I want to make is, that's what the Vermont Legislature decided was a fair payment of the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.755" offset="958360">But this isn't the only tax we pay in Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.305" offset="968600">We're subject to other taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.966" offset="975287">Property taxes, sales taxes, highway use taxes, and what-not.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.037" offset="991483">So that the smallness of this amount really reflects the fact that Mobil's income is earned from dividends that are all outside Vermont, for all practical purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.460" offset="1089181">Let me explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.537" offset="1097540">They were taxed -- the State of New York, which is the commercial domicile of Mobil, has a policy of not taxing dividends from subsidiaries at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.218" offset="1144247">With respect to non-subsidiaries, it reverts the tax, takes the percentage of the tax as to where the income was earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.124" offset="1175907">So with respect to these dividends we paid little or no tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.638" offset="1189909">But now, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that gets to a key question in the case.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="275.274" offset="1204433">Let me ask another question.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.047" offset="1215509">Am I correct, under the Vermont system is there not a statutory provision that enables the taxpayer to seek a reallocation in the event of --</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="287.591" stopTime="289.488">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="287.591" offset="1253752">-- unfairness?</text>
            <text syncTime="288.419" offset="1257096">Did Mobil take advantage of that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_r_hellerstein" startTime="289.488" stopTime="463.145">
            <label>Mr. Jerome R. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="289.488" offset="1261275">We did, and it was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.388" offset="1272874">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.287" offset="1276531">Now, I want to go to the question Mr. Justice Blackmun raised, because one of the key questions in the case, when we come to the commerce clause argument, in which we contend that we ought not, that the apportioned tax by a state, by Vermont, in which we carry on no aspect of these operations, that none of those, no state in which we carry on our operating functions as distinguished from the management of our interest in the stocks, that none of those states ought to be able to apportion that income because you would have a risk of multiple taxation, either the risk of possible double taxation as a result of the taxing power of the commercial domicile or business situs, if that was the state, plus the apportioned tax, or given just the apportionment, the risk of diversity of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.455" offset="1481226">Now, let me go first to this question that Mr. Justice Blackmun has raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.490" offset="1505364">The doctrine, as Your Honors will recall, is well established.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.288" offset="1520515">The multiple taxation doctrine clearly, as developed by its architects, who were Justices Stone, Rutledge, later extended by other Justices of the Court -- there isn't any question but that that doctrine depended on the following proposition, Do other states have the power to tax, regardless of whether they exercise it?</text>
            <text syncTime="376.588" offset="1609749">That's clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.072" offset="1611630">Everybody recognizes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.220" offset="1616227">However, counsel say subsequent opinions of this Court have modified the doctrine so that the multiple taxation doctrine does not prevent a tax on interstate or foreign commerce unless you prove you've actually been double-taxed by another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.795" offset="1686549">First of all, an analysis of the case does not support the view that that doctrine has been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.901" offset="1718941">But authority aside, I want to go to the reasons why it should not be abandoned by this Court, and there are two sets of reasons, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.924" offset="1755094">One are pragmatic and one are matters of constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.106" offset="1771813">First as to the pragmatic objections to the actual multiple taxation test.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.177" offset="1796054">Such a test would foster a competitive race among state legislatures, and tax departments, too, to be the first to tax and the first to assess.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.807" offset="1842552">Moreover, inequalities between corporations earning the same amount of income within a state would be fostered.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.590" offset="1869720">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="442.646" offset="1874004">The taxes could be different under the actual multiple taxation test because of different taxes that each of them pay in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.070" offset="1919666">As a matter of constitutional principle, I suggest that likewise dictates the retention of the power to tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.880" offset="2066892">One, historically the tradition of state taxation was to allocate those in full to the commercial domicile.</text>

            <text syncTime="532.311" offset="2232613">Your Honor, I think there's a fundamental difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.916" offset="2243062">The Federal Constitution has never interfered with a state's working out their own policies to attract business, or to make life livable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.902" offset="5170970">Vermont imposes an annual net income tax on all corporations doing business in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.656" offset="5198033">That tax is measured by that share of a corporation's federal taxable income which is apportioned to Vermont by a standard three-factor formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.511" offset="5241396">Professor Hellerstein suggests that the tax system adopted by the Vermont Legislature necessarily produced the result that they seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.395" offset="5280998">I suggest it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.046" offset="5287581">They arrived at that result by clearly violating the terms of the Vermont statute and not using as apportionable net income their federal taxable income, but rather using as apportionable net income federal taxable income from which they had excluded all income received in the form of dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.329" offset="5368665">As Mr. Hellerstein suggests, Mobil is a fully integrated petroleum company conducting business in part in Vermont and in part in other states of the Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.297" offset="5412551">The question presented is whether the due process and commerce clauses of the Constitution required Vermont to exclude dividend income from apportionable net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.341" offset="5464691">In view of Mobil's substantial business activities in Vermont, I suggest that the due process inquiry is frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.793" offset="5498546">Mobil had the burden of proving that the dividends in question were not related to its integrated petroleum business, and therefore were not properly includable in apportionable net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.164" offset="5556015">Professor Hellerstein mentions that they did seek modification of the formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.801" offset="5574614">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.898" offset="5579003">The Commissioner denied modification and that issue has not been appealed to this Court and the modification issue is not before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.042" offset="6987525">The income is included and is apportionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.547" offset="7013543">Mobil has the burden of proving that these stockholdings were not connected with its integrated petroleum business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.913" offset="7043009">Mobil has not met this burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.176" offset="7052100">In fact, the only proof that Mobil has offered in response to this burden are the statements that the stock certificates are held, managed, and controlled, and the dividends are received outside Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.273" offset="7108420">This brings up another interesting question, and that's Professor Hellerstein's commercial domicile point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.115" offset="7131826">I suggest that that question, that issue, is not properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.746" offset="7150320">There is no evidence in the record that commercial domicile had anything whatsoever to do with Mobil's stockholdings, with the stocks themselves, or with the dividends received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.140" offset="7195982">Mobil has shifted position somewhat in its reply brief to say well, it's either commercial domicile or business situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.662" offset="7225971">There is no business situs which has been identified on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.499" offset="7241331">That leaves a taxpayer with this kind of a record in a position to go to each state in succession and say, "They're not here, can't tax them."</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.669" offset="7282082">So I would suggest that the commercial domicile argument is entirely speculative on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.241" offset="7316355">As to the fact that Mobil's properties are held, that Mobil's stockholdings are held, managed, and controlled outside the state of Vermont, so are many of Mobil's other properties, and the income from all of those properties is clearly includable in apportionable net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.411" offset="7388975">The whole concept of apportionment is to get away from precisely what Mobil is trying to get us into here, and that is the difficulty of ascertaining where in an integrated operation profits arise, and to what particular location those profits are attributable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.608" offset="7457834">That simply is not a workable system, as I think this Court has recognized long ago, and certainly as any scholar in the field has recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.692" offset="7494092">There is nothing in the Constitution which, or in the decisions of this Court, which would support or imply a prohibition against apportioning among the states income from intangible property used in an integrated business activity, a part of which was conducted within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.514" offset="7577475">I made a point on dividends a little earlier in connection with a question from Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.705" offset="7598164">At page A90 of the consolidated appendix there appears a graphic illustration of what I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.620" offset="7625853">In Paragraph 31 there, they report a dividend paid by a company which, and I quote, "had no gross income during the year 1970, the only year here at issue in which it paid dividends to Mobil."</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.350" offset="7680815">What's the relationship between the dividends and the underlying factors?</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.595" offset="7693772">None whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.165" offset="7724074">Mobil next argues that because its operating subsidiaries and affiliations are engaged in foreign commerce, that there is a prohibition against Mobil including the dividends paid on those stocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.468" offset="7773288">Once again, a failure to focus on what the subject of the tax is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.885" offset="7790947">The subject of the tax is the net income, and in a very old case, Page v. Lull, this Court very clearly focused on that distinction and said the net income is not the foreign commerce which produced that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.339" offset="7872763">I think that is a conceptual point that's exceedingly elementary and basic to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.646" offset="7897945">There is no decision of this Court that would determine the tax consequences of income in the hands of a taxpayer on the basis of the tax attributes of the payor of that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.323" offset="7952697">In this case, Mobil is receiving the income from its operating subsidiaries and affiliates, much as it would receive income from the sale of petroleum products, much as it would receive royalties from the licensing of patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.409" offset="8005047">Nothing supports a tax analysis based on the characteristics or the business or the property factors of the payor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.864" offset="8050813">The Court' s decision in Japan Line, I suggest, therefore has no application whatsoever to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.693" offset="8082160">As to Mobil's multiple taxation argument, I believe the Court clearly said in Moorman that multiple taxation must be proved to have in fact occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.492" offset="8133360">I would also suggest that in the context of a tax on apportioned net income, the multiple taxation concept doesn't make any sense, because when you mix taxes, for example these types of tax Mobil argues for in its commercial domicile argument, is a gross receipts tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.678" offset="8438053">This Court, as it has said in several opinions, will correct errors of apportionment when they occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.639" offset="8481938">Mobil's speculative argument that multiple taxation could result from diverse state formulae goes right to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.576" offset="8525720">When it does, the Court clearly is authorized to make a corrective, or require corrective measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.114" offset="8555813">Neither the Constitution nor any decision of this Court grants to the commercial domicile of a multi-state business the power to tax without apportionment income from intangibles held in connection with that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.807" offset="8610565">If that issue was ever properly raised, I suggest that this Court might require apportionment which would fairly allocate to those states in which business is conducted a share of that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.217" offset="8660198">That case has not been raised on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.972" offset="8671274">That is, I think, exceedingly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.765" offset="8706382">Vermont is a state in which Mobil conducts substantial business activities, taxed Mobil's net income including dividends from operating subsidiaries and affiliates fairly apportioned to local business activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.562" offset="8757582">Mobil has conceded that the apportionment factors were correctly calculated and the apportionment formula was correctly applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.382" offset="8788929">On the record, the tax imposed was nondiscriminatory, fairly apportioned to reflect Mobil's substantial business activities in Vermont, and fairly related to the services provided by Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.359" offset="8840756">Mobil has failed to meet its burden of proving that its stockholdings in operating subsidiaries and affiliates were unconnected with its integrated petroleum business, a part of which was carried on in Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.457" offset="8889240">In fact, Mobil has basically conceded that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.679" offset="8902092">Mobil has also failed to meet its burden of proving that its dividends could be subjected to multiple taxation if included in the Vermont tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.880" offset="8942843">Accordingly, under the decisions of this Court, particularly the Moorman, or most recently the Moorman decision, the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court should be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="2228.457" offset="9017240">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.413" offset="9033017">Now, the basic issue in this case is whether certain income from intangible property, namely dividends, can be included in a state's net income tax base subject to apportionment when the taxpayer has made no showing that the intangibles, were not acquired and held as an integral part of its unitary, multi-state business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.585" offset="9145762">Now, Mobil would lead this Court to believe that there is some constitutional requirement in both the due process and commerce clauses of the United States Constitution that expressly prohibits states in which that business is conducted from including such income in apportionable income for state income tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.205" offset="9240221">Now, Mobil initially argues that the state in which a multi-state taxpayer maintains its commercial domicile has the exclusive power to subject such income to a net income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.945" offset="9303124">Now, no decision of this Court supports such an arbitrary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.213" offset="9324231">In fact, all of the apportionment decisions of this Court, net worth cases, income tax cases, ad valorem, utility, property tax cases, refute this idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.318" offset="9384626">Now, recognizing the weakness of the commercial domicile fiction, and we must remember it is a legal fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.130" offset="9423914">Mobil has changed this argument to include the states of either the commercial domicile or business situs of intangible properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.318" offset="9472606">Now, let us examine this fictional situs theory in the context of state income tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.123" offset="9511894">First we must realize that intangibles by their very nature have no fixed location or situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.956" offset="9547212">This Court was well aware of that in many domiciliary cases and particularly in the case of Curry v. McCanless, and noted that the bundle of benefits and interests represented by intangible properties could be spread over many jurisdictions and that any jurisdiction had the power to tax intangibles if those jurisdictions conferred benefits and privileges in regard to the ownership of such intangibles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.347" offset="9692766">But in the case of stock, where is it located for state income tax attribution purposes?</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.077" offset="9731636">This is the underlying question in this case, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.013" offset="9747414">Is it at the legal domicile?</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.289" offset="9760580">The business headquarters or commercial domicile of the corporation?</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.361" offset="9780851">And remember, large multinational corporations may have various locations that could qualify as the commercial domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.174" offset="9820035">Or is it where the stock certificates are physically located?</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.908" offset="9843022">Is the situs where the stock would be pledged or hypothecated?</text>

            <text syncTime="3275.610" offset="13205817">Typically stocks are handled at the executive seat of the corporation, so that normally it's the commercial domicile where all the activities take place earning the stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.673" offset="13326085">It's the commercial domicile or business situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.804" offset="13334549">And that's why traditionally that income was attributed there, and that's why as a matter of fiscal policy it should be attributed there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.315" offset="13588668">Under this commercial domicile rule, does that deprive the State of Delaware of the power to impose this tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.033" offset="13619493">The only cases I know, Your Honor, are the old Cream of Wheat case, I think, in the capital stock tax area which seemed to suggest that the state of corporate domicile, because it incorporated the company, might not be deprived of its power to include all the intangibles, all the assets in its base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.904" offset="13711026">Subsequent opinions of this Court indicated that's open to doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3411.273" offset="13748433">The court could determine that the commercial domicile becoming the real seat of the corporation in a substitute for the powers of the technical corporate domicile, which I would think would be an economically and realistic rule, or conceivably the Court could hold that both would have the power to tax in that case.</text>
