            <text syncTime="20.113" offset="183777">In holding the confession -- as discussed earlier -- holding that that confession must be suppressed, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts initially referred to that portion of Miranda which places a heavy burden on the prosecution to prove a knowing and intelligent waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.075" offset="247724">However, the court continued stating that rather than basing on the lack of an effective waiver, they found the confession to be involuntary and directly offensive to the Firth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.859" offset="294849">It is the common law's position that it is the Fifth Amendment which is deemed to have been offended by the conduct here, that actual official compulsion or coercion must be demonstrated, and that this cannot be accomplished merely by aiding together a number of factors which are not in themselves coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.926" offset="367052">The factors considered below are relevant to the question of voluntariness only in establishing a setting in which actual coercion might have been exerted to overcome the will of the suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.630" offset="413863">Thus, two circumstances are necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.140" offset="423894">One, an act of coercion by an official and a setting, and then I believe the compulsion or the pressure exerted by the police is measured in terms of the setting or the totality of the attendant circumstances in order to determine whether that act is sufficient to have overcome the will of a defendant --</text>

            <text syncTime="108.144" offset="535907">I believe that the court was of the view that it was not necessary in a Fifth Amendment context to demonstrate any actual compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.040" offset="575509">They seem to go along on a view that viewed the conduct of the police in terms of the age and condition of the defendant and then reached a conclusion that somehow this isn't fair and make a leap to actual compulsion.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.970" offset="651264">The wrong legal standard, that they did not properly apply the Fifth Amendment which by its own terms addresses compelled testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.782" offset="682506">And my position is that the actual compulsion --</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="147.665" offset="694000">You don't think they said we must look at the totality of the circumstances and then decide whether his will was overcome by all the circumstances?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_a_h_smith" startTime="159.199" stopTime="567.519">
            <label>Ms. Barbara A. H. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="159.199" offset="740185">They looked at all the circumstances and the language in the opinion is not that the will was overcome but his ability I believe to make a decision was undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.074" offset="779682">Now, this I do not believe constitutes compulsion or involuntariness as contemplated by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.720" offset="814268">The factors that the court relied upon are not in themselves coercive and the police practices involved are not constitutionally forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.080" offset="851675">The defendant was 18 years of age, he had completed the ninth grade and two years of high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.353" offset="872782">And while it was true he was not specifically informed of his statutory right to use the phone, he was twice informed of his right to speak with an attorney and have an attorney present with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.143" offset="915937">As to his psychological condition, assuming that he had voluntarily ingested alcohol and drugs the night before, the defendant also testified at the probable cause hearing that he had been using drugs since the age of 14, and it suggested that the voluntary use of drugs does not allow one to avoid responsibility for the criminal acts and I suggest that it does not permit one to avoid accountability for their own words.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.134" offset="1023875">And in this case it can hardly be said that the defendant was rendered incapable of making a voluntary decision when the court below found that the defendant had voluntary accompanied the police to the station, that he had voluntary given up the sneakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.454" offset="1085210">Moreover, the defendant was sufficiently rational as to have formed an intent to go to the unemployment office either to pick up his check or to challenge the denial of his benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.968" offset="1127215">He is quite capable of answering general questions as to his name, his address, he described the physical structure of his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.143" offset="1155950">He was capable of thinking of rational explanations to explain the condition of his sneakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.368" offset="1176848">He corrected Sgt. Kelley on several occasions, both as to his correct name when the sergeant referred to him as Robert, he said no, it was Joseph.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.229" offset="1212270">He corrected the sergeant as to the name of the bar he had been in with the victim, and he questioned the sergeant as to whether it was one or both of his sneakers which were blood-stained.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.966" offset="1255215">Moreover, he had sufficient presence of mind to try to mitigate his conduct by offering the excuse that he had been whacked out, drunk, and that he flipped out after the victim had made fun of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.493" offset="1301295">Moreover, the police testified that he exhibited no aberrational conduct at the police station, that his eyes were not glassy, that he had no difficulty in walking.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.524" offset="1337448">And I would suggest that the tape supports that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.165" offset="1352077">In addition, a doctor who listened to the tape testified that there were no apparent drug effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.188" offset="1380080">So there we have conditions which might, if there were actual coercion, tend to magnify that coercion into some kind of unconstitutionally permissible behavior, but here we have no actual coercion on the part of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.837" offset="1446745">They are criticized in addition for having conducted a skillful investigation, for making a misrepresentation as to the number of identifying witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.618" offset="1489795">In Frazier v. Cupp, the defendant was falsely told that his codefendant had confessed and it was sympathetically suggested to him that it had been the victim who had promoted the fight that led to the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.746" offset="1546324">Neither of these practices were found to be coercive by this Court, and neither were held sufficient to render a statement involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.042" offset="1587493">A suggestion to tell the truth, especially when it is not made in a threatening context, does not constitute coercion under the case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.711" offset="1622183">Indeed, the Constitution does not prohibit every element which influences a defendant to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.125" offset="1651858">If it did, I think we would have to totally do away with police interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.569" offset="1673697">Finally, the police made no promises to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.854" offset="1686758">They specifically advised him on more than three occasions that they could make no promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.955" offset="1715179">Therefore, we suggest that in this case there are no acts of official compulsion, and furthermore that the suggestion that the concept of police interrogation is in itself inherently compulsion cannot furnish this necessary factor to a finding of involuntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.993" offset="1791352">In Miranda, in extending the Fifth Amendment privilege to the context of police interrogation, the court posited the factual premise that the police interrogation was inherently coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.162" offset="1835969">The safeguards of the warning requirements of Miranda were then designed to dispel that inherent coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.451" offset="1865226">In this case, it is quite clear that those safeguards were complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.682" offset="1882049">He was fully advised of his Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.810" offset="1894588">Therefore, the inherent compulsion of police interrogation must be deemed to have been dispelled and cannot be utilized to provide the necessary factor of actual official coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.608" offset="1941817">The Court generally stated in United States v. Washington in the context of a grand jury proceeding that any possible coercion or unfairness resulting from a defendant or a witness' misimpression that he must necessarily tell the truth is completely removed by the warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.652" offset="2009945">In this case, the warnings were fully given.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.275" offset="2024469">Also we would suggest that this Court recently has rejected the factual premise of inherent coercion in police interrogations.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.921" offset="2055084">Primarily in Michigan v. Tucker, rather than view police interrogation as inherently coercive, the Court focused on basic traditional Fifth Amendment considerations in finding that the police conduct in Michigan did not deprive respondent of the privilege against self-incrimination as such, even though there was a disregard of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.219" offset="2140244">We suggest that if the Court were of the continued view that custodial interrogation itself supplied the compulsion necessary to involve the Firth Amendment, the question of the degree of compulsion or the particular acts of the police involved would not arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.827" offset="2202728">Most importantly, we think that this Court's decision in cases holding that statements taken involving violation of Miranda are not per se inadmissible at trial for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.831" offset="2246719">In Harris v. New York and Oregon v. Hass, the Court focused on whether the trustworthiness of the statements satisfied legal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.487" offset="2281305">An inquiry into trustworthiness, at least under the rule of Rogers v. Richmond, is irrelevant, that the question is only whether the statements were involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.571" offset="2329684">Therefore, we suggest that if custodial interrogation itself does not render a statement involuntary in a fundamental constitutional sense --</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.905" offset="8079026">The defendant has been fed, and I will argue to this Court, three principal arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.903" offset="8095013">First, that the Supreme Court was correct in excluding the 12:00 inculpatory admission as involuntary in the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.009" offset="8127404">Second, that the clothing that was taken from his home was properly excluded because the search warrant rested on an involuntary confession; and, thirdly, that the 3:00 o'clock inculpatory admission supposedly made to the mother in the presence of the police officers should be excluded under the criteria of Brown v. Illinois and Darwin v. Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.213" offset="8220191">In determining the issue of involuntariness, the court explicitly did not rely upon one of the alternative theories that had been incorporated in the decision of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.691" offset="8266167">The trial judge found a Miranda violation and also determined independently that the confession was involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.996" offset="8299395">The Massachusetts Supreme Court, the lower court in determining voluntariness, looked to the totality of the circumstances and did not adopt the Miranda violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.991" offset="8343385">The initial confrontation with the police I have already mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.214" offset="8356237">I think it is significant to say that the police were clearly anxious to apprehend defendant Meehan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2103.616" offset="8517883">The interrogator early on into the interrogation made misrepresentations of fact to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.566" offset="8545677">In fact, I would use the word "interrogators" in the plural because although there was one Sgt. Kelley doing most of the talking, or so it appears, there were three other police officers intimately present in this confrontation between a citizen and his police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.370" offset="8612864">And so to some extent the representations of one were the representations of four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.067" offset="8631672">And indeed at one point in the interrogation, Sgt. Kelly said, "And you could ask two others who are right here."</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.479" offset="8661243">The defendant was told that he was seen with the decedent by two witnesses on the previous evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.373" offset="8688828">This misrepresentation was repeated at least seven times by the interrogator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.283" offset="8712547">This misrepresentation was further punctuated by the representation that the witnesses were positively sure of their identification and that they had known the defendant for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.087" offset="8763747">This is inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.508" offset="8777435">The lower court also concluded that the interrogator lied when intimating to the defendant things about the strength of the government's case, to the effect that had the case had already been against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.016" offset="8831457">The interrogator also misrepresented to the defendant, "We are here to help and the truth is going to be a good defense in this particular case."</text>

            <text syncTime="2210.755" offset="8946395">So initially the defendant suggested the cases of this Court have noted misrepresentation of fact as one of the criteria in the totality of determining involuntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.051" offset="8991535">Secondly, or thirdly, promises were made by the police interrogator to the defendant while he was in custody, during the interrogation in express terms, Sgt. Kelley told the defendant that a confession would help the defendant in the defense of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.846" offset="9066768">It is suggested that Sgt. Kelley made personal assurances as well as his, the police interrogator's personal intervention with the law in the matter of this case Sgt.
