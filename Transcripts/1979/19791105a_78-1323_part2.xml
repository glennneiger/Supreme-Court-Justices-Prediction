            <text syncTime="65.906" offset="366947">That's not involved here, but it certainly is not true that a factor such as Federal income tax, which is after all money that could never have gotten to these beneficiaries if the man had lived -- but that's not something to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.574" offset="425671">It is no more trivial than the other things that go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.678" offset="434134">In fact, it is far more important than the other things that go on in the trials of these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.087" offset="559731">In fact, Plaintiff Counsel came and said, "Judge, these people may ask him questions like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.876" offset="578853">We want you to instruct these lawyers before the witness ever gets on he can't talk about that."</text>
            <text syncTime="123.247" offset="596407">We had an argument before the witness went on, we had an argument afterward, about our right to cross-examine on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.175" offset="616051">As far as adding to the complexity here, if this expert witness who, as I say, came on with the wages projected, then he discounted those wages -- Excuse me, not discounted -- he deducted from those wages the personal expenditures of the decedent, clothing, food, entertainment, 10% this year, 25% later, 50% later, 31%, calculates all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.242" offset="720332">He says, "Oh, and what would he have contributed in terms of household chores, 9%?"</text>
            <text syncTime="158.070" offset="735692">Calculates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.024" offset="739453">One more sentence of that testimony -- He could have said, "Of course, he would have to pay income taxes, about 14%."</text>
            <text syncTime="165.344" offset="764740">One more sentence, that's the complexity this would have added to that calculation.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.842" offset="794728">I don't think that the problem here is -- All the courts who dealt with this have said it is a question of balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.160" offset="823986">Certainly we ought to be permitted to deal with matters that are clearly relevant under the standards of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.837" offset="1394709">I am not here saying that every case in which a trial judge doesn't receive the evidence, and in which Appellate Court says, "That's all right, but it wasn't prejudicial in that case."</text>

            <text syncTime="335.160" offset="1444028">I am just saying that the rule should be that it is relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.770" offset="12642408">Of course, you can't seek an instruction on a matter as to which there is no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.753" offset="12662366">I am talking now about the matter of the take-home pay of the decedent, where we weren't allowed to show what his tax burden was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.678" offset="12698102">And we weren't allowed to show it not because -- I don't know what all this chatter was about discretion and trial judge -- The reason this trial judge didn't do it is the Illinois courts won't let you talk about taxes at all, balanced, half way, part way, all the way, at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.676" offset="12750033">And that's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.392" offset="12756929">It is contrary to the standards of FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.657" offset="12766020">Now, we asked about the cautionary instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.985" offset="12775320">We asked to talk to this witness about the taxes the man would have paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.975" offset="12795277">We asked to put in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.284" offset="12800502">The judge says -- and I cite A74 and 75, and again back to A62, the judge says the Illinois courts won't let us talk about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.298" offset="12836551">And it was decided on that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3187.285" offset="12852537">On McWeeney and Boxberger, which I think accepts it, we would say that whatever the situation was with a man who earned $4800 a year, and after a trial it was regarded as really de minimus and not worth it -- in Boxberger the man, a fireman in the 70s earning from $18,000 to $40,000 projected, our man $17,000 at time of trial to $50,000 projected, exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.804" offset="12954624">And in the Second Circuit, which follows McWeeney, after all, in the Sabena case, it was $15,000 to $25,000 projected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.323" offset="12984613">So we say the McWeeney rule fits this like a glove in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.451" offset="13001226">It would require that this kind of evidence be received, and if it isn't received require that the judgment be reversed, which is what we ask.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.493" offset="13261302">Oh, no, they are not, because one of the ideas of a windfall to railroads has that concept which is wrong, because the railroad still has to run the trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.799" offset="13294529">It still has to hire a fireman, and the fireman is paying taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.270" offset="13312502">In addition to that, we then have to pay this award, which all we say ought to be properly measured, to do just what Congress said, which is to compensate these people for the loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.689" offset="13358164">Now, the one other item which complicates this, or the parties try to complicate it, is this double tax, tax on the tax, tax on interest idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.644" offset="13389928">That is a totally, totally separate concept, and would arise if the decedent had had no taxable income, no income subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.658" offset="13434023">And that's because it relates to the use of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.563" offset="13445622">It goes to the whole concept of single sum damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.678" offset="13458056">It goes to the question of whether if it goes to children and their tax bracket is such they don't pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.521" offset="13477491">And it goes, as I mentioned earlier, to on what basis do these folks calculate the discount rate?</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.530" offset="13497448">What they love to do is use a low rate because that produces a high award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.762" offset="13514376">They use a low rate and they mix in some municipal bond interest, which if you actually invest in that way wouldn't be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.807" offset="13538617">But now they want it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.953" offset="13547186">They can't have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.996" offset="13555336">But the point I am making is that this tax on tax, and what you do with the award after you get it and what you want to assume about it, has nothing in the world to do with the question we brought before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.717" offset="13594206">It would arise in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.407" offset="13600998">It is a totally separate issue, as Judge Friendly recognized in McWeeney, because he never said it was a totally offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.124" offset="13627852">Otherwise, he said, if a fellow earns enough you ought to consider his taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.392" offset="13640913">That's all we are saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.173" offset="13644048">In this day and age, people earn enough, it is substantial, and you ought to consider it, under traditional rules of the FELA damages.</text>
