            <label>Mr. Oscar C. Adamson, II</label>
            <text syncTime="43.019" offset="275414">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.042" offset="291506">This case comes before this Court on appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.600" offset="321808">The issue presented by this appeal succinctly stated is whether or not the Minnesota courts may exercise constitutionally permissible quasi in rem jurisdiction over a non-resident tortfeasor who has absolutely no minimum contacts whatsoever with the State of Minnesota by permitting the plaintiff to garnish the defendant's liability insurance policy on the basis that the defendant's insurer does business within the State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.736" offset="462346">That is the issue presented by this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.849" offset="474781">The operative facts are very simple but they provide I think the necessary background.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.622" offset="501844">Back in 1972, Mr. Rush and Mr. Savchuk were involved in an automobile accident in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.236" offset="528280">At that time, both Mr. Rush and Mr. Savchuk were residents and citizens of the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.511" offset="553462">About a year and a half later Mr. Savchuk decides to emigrate to Minnesota and about a year after that he commenced this lawsuit against Mr. Rush by serving a garnishment summons on State Farm, Mr. Rush's liability insurer in the State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.961" offset="627231">I might say that Mr. Rush's liability insurers, State Farm, is his liability insurer by reason of a contract of insurance which was written and issued in the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.401" offset="680939">There was no point of contact with any of these activities at all until Mr. Savchuk's going to Minnesota and then commencing this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.856" offset="722840">As soon as this was done, Rush and State Farm immediately challenged the jurisdictional basis of the garnishment quasi in rem jurisdiction by appropriate motion and the Minnesota District Court and the Minnesota Supreme Court found no due process problems whatsoever with the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.793" offset="806536">We then appealed to this Court and this Court vacated the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court and remanded it back to the Minnesota Supreme Court with directions to reconsider their prior determination in light of Shaffer v. Heitner.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.265" offset="884381">The Minnesota Supreme Court duly reconsidered the matter and found no problem whatsoever with the quasi in rem jurisdiction in this case and felt that Shaffer v. Heitner did not change a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.258" offset="948433">This second appeal followed and this Court noted probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.550" offset="969540">Now, before talking about Shaffer a little bit, I would like to express to the Court my understanding of the reasoning followed by the Minnesota Supreme Court in ignoring Shaffer.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.221" offset="1032234">By ignoring, I say.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.177" offset="1044041">Maybe that is an inappropriate word -- distinguishing it.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="238.747" offset="1058356">Misunderstanding.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="oscar_c_adamson_ii" startTime="240.783" stopTime="339.190">
            <label>Mr. Oscar C. Adamson, II</label>
            <text syncTime="240.783" offset="1066506">I would like to use that word, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.854" offset="1078836">First of all -- and I think this is rather interesting -- the Minnesota Supreme Court, after talking about the facts in Shaffer, said that it considered the decision unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.501" offset="1121364">It also said that Minnesota's interest in facilitating recoveries for resident plaintiffs -- notice that language, facilitating recoveries for resident plaintiffs -- not only requires a local forum in Minnesota but may override traditional choice of law analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.927" offset="1195029">Now, it may be there that the Minnesota Supreme Court was mixing jurisdiction and choice of law which we all have so much trouble with, but at any rate that is what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.628" offset="1233899">The Minnesota Supreme Court went on to say that Minnesota possesses sufficient contacts -- without identifying them -- and that due process is not violated in this quasi in rem action because of three things, and here they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.066" offset="1299623">One, notice was given to the defendant, it sure was.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.865" offset="1314879">There is no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.051" offset="1323551">Two, the defendant cannot be held liable for more than his policy limits in Minnesota pursuant to this quasi in rem proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.778" offset="1366497">And three, the procedure is available only to Minnesota residents and it is not available to non-residents, it is available to only Minnesota residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.941" offset="1411114">Now, these are the three bases which the Minnesota Supreme Court enunciated as providing the due process basis for this quasi in rem proceeding that I have described.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="339.190" stopTime="344.003">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="339.190" offset="1460120">Your brief indicates that this plaintiff has now moved out of the State of Minnesota.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="oscar_c_adamson_ii" startTime="344.003" stopTime="449.667">
            <label>Mr. Oscar C. Adamson, II</label>
            <text syncTime="344.003" offset="1479346">Yes, he has emigrated again to Pennsylvania so that means I think he has lived in three states in six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.084" offset="1511737">Probably that isn't material, but it does illustrate how fluid our population is when we are trying to arrive at a constitutional nexus based upon the transitory residence of a plaintiff in a given state at a given time.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.412" offset="1577044">Now, that isn't all the Minnesota Supreme Court did. I think it added the frosting on the cake really because after having reasoned all of this and had come to the conclusion that due process was satisfied, it really gave the coup de grace to Mr. Rush.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.334" offset="1636707">It said that in this situation where Minnesota requires jurisdiction of an out-of-state accident over a non-resident and so forth, it will apply Minnesota substantive law -- "we are not a choice of law."</text>
            <text syncTime="396.510" offset="1689370">They found that not only do we have jurisdiction but the choice of law decision we are going to make, we are going to apply Minnesota law to this accident because it is more favorable to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.620" offset="1729808">The consequences in this particular case is, Your Honors, that by so doing the Minnesota Supreme Court would strip from Mr. Rush what is basically an absolute defense, the guest statute of Indiana which was certainly applicable to him and Mr. Savchuk at the time of the accident, and also would substitute a doctrine of comparative negligence for contributory negligence and also would prevent this action from being dismissed by reason of the running of the statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.550" offset="1853524">All of these things Mr. Savchuk got by being able to invoke the quasi in rem jurisdiction of the Minnesota Supreme Court.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="476.966" offset="2011199">And you also do not have a direct action statute, as Arkansas does?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="oscar_c_adamson_ii" startTime="481.543" stopTime="658.616">
            <label>Mr. Oscar C. Adamson, II</label>
            <text syncTime="481.543" offset="2029589">No, we do not have a direct action statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.429" offset="2041083">I believe only two or three states, Louisiana and Wisconsin do, but Minnesota does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.871" offset="2074833">Now, of course, in the last analysis, Shaffer v. Heitner is going to mean what this Court tell us what it means, but our understanding of the teaching of Shaffer v. Heitner is very simple and very, very easy to comprehend.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.801" offset="2138572">We do not agree with the Minnesota Supreme Court about the lack of clarity of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.580" offset="2161664">It seems to me that the heart of Shaffer comes right out and says that the standard for determining whether the exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction is consistent with due process is the minimum contact standard enunciated in International Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.644" offset="2230000">And you look to International Shoe and you find out what are those minimal contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.143" offset="2247973">They are the relationship among the defendant, the forum and the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.331" offset="2276707">If you applied that yardstick to the instant case, you would find two things immediately, and there can't be any argument about it, none whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.297" offset="2308577">There is absolutely no contact whatsoever between defendant Rush over in Indiana and the state of Minnesota, none.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.170" offset="2348074">And there is absolutely no to my understanding relationship between the litigation and the state of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.932" offset="2375137">The only state in the union that has any meaningful contact with this litigation would be the state of Indiana, where everything happened, where Mr. Savchuk was allegedly injured and where he was made well.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.686" offset="2442115">Thus, if you read Shaffer as I have and read International Shoe as I have just done, that is the end of it, there is no due process here on this quasi in rem basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.803" offset="2494568">Now, the Minnesota court took a somewhat different view about these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.597" offset="2529782">The Minnesota court first of all completely ignored the lack of relationship between the forum in the state of Minnesota and the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.905" offset="2563009">It snubbed that matter completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.760" offset="2574399">Instead of that, it placed its primary emphasis not on the defendant but upon the residency of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.849" offset="2610761">Now, it may well be that the state of Minnesota has an understandably strong public policy as enunciated by its courts to provide its residents with a forum, but that policy does not establish due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.065" offset="2675649">It almost begs the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.495" offset="2685367">Assuming such policy, you nevertheless must ask the question does effecting that policy in this particular matter violate or not violate the due process clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.415" offset="6773008">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.620" offset="6801847">The facts are simple in this case as far as how the accident happened and where it occurred, but I think we have to look at what Minnesota was doing after Seider v. Roth and that type of case started out of New York, which had to do with automobiles and automobile liability insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.061" offset="6915636">In 1969, Minnesota realized that in order to provide a forum for its residents, through the legislation they did pass the garnishment statute, the 571.41, adding subdivision 2, where they definitely had in mind this type of case, such as Savchuk v. Rush.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.134" offset="7027858">They felt there where there would be a policy of insurance between a defendant and the insurance company, where the defendant had proper notice and the plaintiff was a resident of the forum or of Minnesota, he could then bring the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.066" offset="7143633">They even used terms, as the Court knows, judgment, debtor and defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.124" offset="7179891">Following that statute, the first time I believe that Minnesota actually looked at the statute was in Judge Neville's opinion in the Rintalla case, and I think that goes to the heart of the matter here, is Judge Neville -- and we are right in line with the Shaffer case as far as saying fundamental fairness and contacts -- that really is the defendant getting due process under the statute and he looked at it and said, yes, because the insurance company and the defendant and the plaintiff are actually -- you have to look at all of them in the transaction, the automobile accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.675" offset="7406111">You can't just isolate it on the defendant such as we have in the Shaffer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.767" offset="7438399">Judge Neville then felt that the statute was constitutional, they have applied it and they have applied it in Minnesota over the last ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.986" offset="7483329">So when Savchuk moved to Minnesota, actually his father was transferred to Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.870" offset="7522826">Some year or so later he moved after the accident, we received the case in our office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.549" offset="7565563">Actually, the forum in Indiana, the statute of limitations had run and, of course, the Minnesota statute has run now because in 1974, when we obtained the garnishment and this procedure started, State Farm and along with its defendant through the policy has been bringing it before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.353" offset="7680815">Now, the important part of the decisions in Minnesota and what we look to is the fact of the insurance company is the real interest, the real party in interest in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.075" offset="7767646">There is no question that from the time that the accident happened, albeit in Indiana, the insurance company then comes in and calls the shots, if you please, from then on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2003.273" offset="8116433">What I am saying is that if there is going to be settlement discussions, it is going to be with the insurance company, and if the insurance company is going to settle, it is the insurance company, they select the counsel they are going to use to defend, they tell when it is going to be settled, they say whether or not it is going to court, The defendant, especially in Minnesota, where the statute and the cases in the Supreme Court have stated, only the $50,000 limit is involved.</text>
