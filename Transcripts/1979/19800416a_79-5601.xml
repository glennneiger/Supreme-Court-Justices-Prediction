            <text syncTime="247.251" offset="1092420">Well, that rationale would support the application of 1983 to Puerto Rico, because Congress does not legislate for Puerto Rico within -- in the sense that it does for the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.226" offset="1340270">But I would say with regard to Puerto Rico that the same concerns that prompted the 1871 Civil Rights Act are in effect there, namely is the Federal Constitution going to be given the same even-handed application by local officials in that Territory as it is in all the other States and Territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.434" offset="1421145">And I think that that justifies the application of 1983 to Puerto Rico.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.084" offset="1671711">The complaint in this case was dismissed by the District Court purely for the reason that the plaintiff had failed to allege bad faith in his complaint despite the fact that he had pleaded constitutional violations and he had pleaded that these violations had transpired under color of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.388" offset="1744959">And our position is that this question presents two analytically different issues for resolution by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.247" offset="1836387">In our view, the fatal flaw of the First Circuit decision is that it merged these two questions and decided both of them incorrectly by requiring the plaintiff to allege bad faith as an element of his cause of action under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.555" offset="1893543">If I might turn to the qualified immunity issues first, this Court has decided we would submit in Scheur v. Rhodes that in a series of cases that have been decided by the Court that the qualified immunity matters are matters of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.900" offset="1958954">Although the Court has never referenced it specifically to Rule 8(c), we would submit that the matters of affirmative defense under Rule 8(c) have been continuously referred to in that way by the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="781.801" offset="3230595">The other circuits have pretty uniformly held that the defendant has the burden and the reason for that, I would submit, is because of very sound promising consideration, namely these matters, matters that go to the qualified immunity issue in many cases are singularly within the knowledge of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.719" offset="3306245">There were so many different types of sources which the defendant might turn to to justify a qualified immunity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.814" offset="3342608">The defense I think both as enunciated by this Court and as interpreted by the lower Federal courts is very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.785" offset="3370506">Defendants might look to administrative practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.182" offset="3380120">They might look to decided cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.219" offset="3388270">They might look to the advice of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.403" offset="3396942">They might look to a manual that is produced by the police department or the government that they work for.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.934" offset="3423065">Plaintiff simply has no way of knowing at the time he grants the complaint what the defendant's explanation for unconstitutional conduct might be and therefore we suggest that is only the defendant who can consistent with the requirements of Rule 11 come forward and plead the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.822" offset="3514702">That is true not only because the defendant is the only one who would know what the possible sources of his good faith might be but the defendant is the only one who would know the circumstances under which he claims to have developed some good faith belief in the legality of his action.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.729" offset="3590248">For example, suppose the defendant relies upon advice of counsel and ultimately the defendant's position at trial is going to be, my lawyer told me that it was legal for me to engage in this act, which it has turned out violates the plaintiff's constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.916" offset="3655032">It is not only the question of what the lawyer told him but what that defendant said to the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.492" offset="3673318">What was the reason why he sought advice from that lawyer, what information did he give to the lawyer before he asked the lawyer for an opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1048.348" offset="4296808">This is a case though which is somewhat confusing in terms of what the First Circuit decided, because the First Circuit appears to say not only in this case but in its other decisions that the reason they put that burden on the plaintiff is as though they consider pleading bad faith an element of the plaintiff's cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.802" offset="4370578">And that is the second half of the analysis that the First Circuit gives us, namely that in order to plead successfully a 1983 case the plaintiff has to allege that the defendant acted in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.857" offset="4422823">That is a ruling which may very well, although I just saw it a few moments ago, be disposed of by the Court's decision today in the Owen case because I take it that one of the things that we could say on the basis of that is that bad faith in the sense of negating qualified immunity can't be an element of the very cause of action if that cause of action can be asserted against the municipality without making the claim of negating qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.969" offset="4523238">It would also, the First Circuit decision viewed that way, it would seem to me require this Court really to overrule or at least to do substantial damage to Monroe v. Pape, and Carey v. Piphus, cases in which this Court has in effect said there were two requirements for making out a cause of action under 1983 -- (1) deprivation of a constitutional right and (2) a deprivation which takes place under color of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.985" offset="5147355">In this case, then, our submission is that the plaintiff had only a responsibility to allege the substantive elements of the constitutional violations he was pleading, namely with regard to the First Amendment violation that he had been engaged in speech activities which are arguably protected by the First Amendment and (2) that he was fired as a result of the fact that he engaged in that speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.939" offset="6631111">That was not pleaded directly and so he did not state a violation to the First Amendment at a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.716" offset="6666219">This was not before the District Court and was not decided by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.571" offset="6689625">So it should not be before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.528" offset="6701432">And that wasn't an element of pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.156" offset="6720031">He was not discharged either when he testified in the criminal case against his own supervisor, underlining his authority or when criminal charges were brought against him for wiretapping of his fellow officers in conversations concerning official matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.656" offset="6794010">He was discharged two months afterwards, after three years of all this when it came apparent to the Superintendent of Police that his conduct was injurious and harming to the Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.024" offset="6883453">So I say that in justice it couldn't be said that he was arbitrarily discharged as he actually pleaded in his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.007" offset="6951372">The complaint was dismissed mainly because of a failure to state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.204" offset="6988152">He did not plead any bad faith on the part of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.269" offset="7032456">And I deem that the logic would justify on the plaintiff the absence of such bad faith on the defendant is that otherwise defendant would not have been liable for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.525" offset="7141439">So we have the concurrence of that very bad faith, linked it with valid cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.283" offset="7180518">It seems to me that discharge from employment does not entitle anyone to recover from damages under civil rights action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.512" offset="7221373">Bad faith, malice or recklessness, such circumstances actually constitute elements of any valid claim for relief, simply because in their absence the pleader would not be entitled at all to the relief requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.488" offset="7313324">I would like to bring your attention to the opinion delivered this very morning by Mr. Justice Brennan in the case of Owen v. The City of Independence where on page 2 it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.661" offset="7386049">"Where an immunity was well established at common law and where its rationale was compatible with the purpose of 1983 this has been construed to incorporate that immunity."</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.555" offset="7457625">The same page establishes that police officers actually enjoy that immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.795" offset="7502555">The purpose of pleading is to inform about the essence of the claim and the ground on which it rests, to indicate the basis upon which relief is sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.789" offset="7562533">And so no one should be required to put forward a defense against minor imputations which have not even been formulated or articulated or to state his position concerning possible or probable issues which have not been raised yet in a case against him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2270.994" offset="9187349">Besides, petitioner had a hearing and it seems that the statute that created the Commission of investigation, prosecutions and appeals of the police provides that the Commission may confirm, revoke or modify the decisions or acts appealed, it could be said that petitioner's discharge was not in fact final until its time for an appeal had expired or after 15 days after being affirmed upon appeal that a Commission reconsideration was requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.817" offset="9326634">So he was granted his hearing before his discharge was final and that comes from the very facts that were pleaded.</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.844" offset="9418794">Just two points, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.192" offset="9428093">First of all, this is a case where the plaintiff did allege that he was entitled to a hearing, and that allegation is supported by regulations which were drafted and promulgated by the respondent in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.488" offset="9493295">And so it is a case where if he has any good faith defense that might even remotely or conceivably be imagined, no one other than the respondent could possibly know what his excuse or rationale for not following his own regulations might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.394" offset="9560900">And this is a case that in that sense the burden definitely belongs on him to come forward and escape from the logical import of his own regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.786" offset="9598516">Secondly --</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.977" offset="9599248">I don't have it in front of me right now, but isn't there something in the complaint itself about the conducting of a hearing?</text>

            <text syncTime="2383.594" offset="9637700">The complaint alleges that the plaintiff was entitled to a hearing under the Puerto Rico Police Act of 1974.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Avery</label>
            <text syncTime="2394.273" offset="9680436">No, he didn't get a hearing, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.427" offset="9689109">There was an investigation by the Legal Division of the Police Department which exonerated the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.340" offset="9712724">But that wasn't a hearing as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.982" offset="9719306">In fact the answer admits -- there was an answer filed in this case and it admits that he was discharged without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.750" offset="9750340">He received no hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.568" offset="9761625">There was an investigation by an attorney for the Legal Department of the Police Department but not a hearing as such.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2422.881" offset="9794853">The affirmative allegation is that his discharge was without prior hearing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Avery</label>
            <text syncTime="2427.681" offset="9814079">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.506" offset="9817422">That was admitted in the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.689" offset="9826095">And the second point was that although the petitioner does not use the phrase "First Amendment" in the complaint, which is what the respondent was referring to when he spoke about the First Amendment issue, the petitioner clearly does set forward the facts which support a First Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.708" offset="9906239">And we feel that really beyond doubt that the First Amendment claim is very much a part of this case.</text>
