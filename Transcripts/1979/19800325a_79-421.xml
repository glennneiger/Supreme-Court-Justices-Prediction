            <label>Mr. Northcutt Ely</label>
            <text syncTime="32.467" offset="233200">The primary question before the Court, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, is whether the Boulder Canyon Project Act, this Court's opinion in Arizona v. California, and its two decrees in that case require the Secretary of the Interior to deliver water in satisfaction of present perfected rights in excess of 160 acres per owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.941" offset="367156">If time permits, I would refer also to two other issues in the case, namely the finality that we feel attaches to the conduct of the Department of the Interior and the other judicial approaches to this matter over a period of some thirty-odd years and finally briefly the standing of the respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.132" offset="467884">We have briefed all three issues, I may say.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.994" offset="479378">The area involved in the Imperial Valley, the Court may recall, is below sea-level, it was irrigated starting in 1901 by a canal that took off in the United States and followed an ancient river channel through Mexico, the Alama --it is shown in yellow on this map -- and back into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.706" offset="574151">This was done without federal assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.728" offset="586271">It continued, the area continued to be irrigated in that fashion for some forty years.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.523" offset="617514">The area under irrigation grew gradually from about 100,000 to the precise figure of 424,145 acres as of the effective date of the Boulder Canyon Project which was June 25, 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.872" offset="682820">This Court's decree of last January 1979 so determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.401" offset="708942">It adjudicated that the present perfected rights, that is rights to water for a specific area of land, 424,145 acres, had been established under state law by valid appropriations with the priority of 1901 and that the quantity diverted and used in the effective date of the project, 1929, was 2,600,000 acre-feet.</text>

            <label>Mr. Northcutt Ely</label>
            <text syncTime="181.912" offset="830986">That is in this Court's decree of January 1979, in Arizona v. California.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="189.957" offset="863169">That is a supplemental decree that got around to specifying the perfected rights?</text>

            <label>Mr. Northcutt Ely</label>
            <text syncTime="195.439" offset="885112">That is correct, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.978" offset="895248">It determined the present perfected rights of some 17 defined tracks of land in Arizona and 59 in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.074" offset="935685">Of the area in the Imperial Irrigation District, it is stipulated that 233,000 acres are in holdings in excess of 160 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.126" offset="983855">There are 800 such holdings in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.105" offset="999842">This came about because prior to the time when the Boulder County Project Act was enacted, the economy of the valley had established that pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.651" offset="1046026">Lands had originally been acquired under the Desert Land Act in tracts of 320 acres, not 160 acres, and over the years have been consolidated as the laws of California and indeed the United States permitted, with the result that as of 1929 and now the economy of the valley is reflected in holdings larger than 160 acres.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.444" offset="1201194">I should add that under the laws of California, the district is a trustee for the landowners who are the equitable owners of the water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.849" offset="1238810">The district cannot sell them, it cannot mortgage them under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.195" offset="1256155">It is a trustee.</text>

            <label>Mr. Northcutt Ely</label>
            <text syncTime="294.774" offset="1282487">The Bounder Canyon Project Act -- this Court's 1964 decree, I should say, defined present perfected rights as rights acquired under state law and perfected by the application of a specific quantity of water to a defined area of land by the effective date of the project act.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.133" offset="1363884">The Court in its definition adopted the state law as the key to the magnitude and priority of the present perfected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.077" offset="1415711">The problem here arises from primarily section 6 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act read in connection with section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.364" offset="1460851">Section 6 directed the Secretary of the Interior to so operate Hoover Dam and Lake Mead as to satisfy three functions First flood control, navigational flood control second, irrigation and domestic uses and the satisfaction of present perfected rights pursuant to Article 8 of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.701" offset="1558131">Article 8 of the Colorado River Compact declared that present perfected rights are unimpaired by this compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.653" offset="1590000">It did not define the term but the legislative history makes -- as reported to Congress during the Project Act debates, make it very clear that the present perfected rights being talked about are the very ones involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.644" offset="1641932">Imperial Irrigation District representatives appeared before Mr. Hoover and the Commissioners and granted protection if there was going to be an interstate allocation of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.666" offset="1686026">Article 8 refers to the very lands involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.295" offset="1700551">The rights were perfected by the application of water to these same lands, the 233,000 acres of excess lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.221" offset="1732211">This was well known to Congress and during the course of the debates on the Boulder Canyon Project Act, you may recall, there were Swing-Johnson bills, the question arose as to whether the land limitations of the reclamation law of 160 acres per owner should apply to these lands, and the decision was plainly that they should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.522" offset="1825416">There were no less than five efforts made in the two Houses to add a specific section to the Project Act which would have extended the 160-acre limitation to these lands, and each of these failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.231" offset="1888319">A House committee included such language in one bill, the Senate when it passed its bill omitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.906" offset="1926980">Three times in the Senate Senators Phipps, Hayden, an Ashurst offered amendments to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.640" offset="1961984">Each of these was abandoned because it had no support.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.123" offset="1979852">The law as enacted does not contain any specific acreage limitation on the present perfected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.711" offset="2010258">It does contain in section 14 a direction that this act shall be deemed a supplement to the reclamation law which will govern the construction, operation and maintenance of the project, except as otherwise provided in this act, and the question is whether this cross-reference to the reclamation law somehow overrode section 16's mandate to satisfy present perfected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.841" offset="2114748">Now the consequence if it did is that the Secretary cannot deliver water to some 233,000 acres that this Court has adjudicated to be within the 424,000 adjoined present perfected rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.355" offset="2176815">Well, they could deliver it if the land was in 160 -- all held by persons owning no more than 160 acres.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.441" offset="2221119">If the equitable owner of the water right is compelled to sell, the effect, according to our opponents' brief it this the land carries with it no present perfected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.693" offset="2286111">It must be sold at desert land prices, $25 to $50 per acre and it will revert to desert.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.148" offset="2315995">Now, you may or may not agree with that consequence of the statute, but that is what our opponents say and that is the basis upon which the Ninth Circuit decided the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.100" offset="2371793">And under that approach it is a truism to say that the landowner could sell no water.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.878" offset="2402931">He is stripped of it and if there can be a greater impairment than reduction of the water right to zero, it is hard to imagine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.884" offset="2430934">It is alleged and the argument is made that the land is worth $1,200 to $1,400 per acre irrigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.480" offset="2465311">It has been irrigated for fifty years now or more but would have to be stripped of its water right if sold at desert land prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.580" offset="2621733">After a trial, Judge Turrentine decided against the United States in a well considered opinion in which he said it was repugnant to the mandate that water be delivered in satisfaction of present perfected rights to say that water should be withheld from 233,000 acres enjoying such rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="686.199" offset="2848162">In any event, he referred (Mr. Griswold) to the fact that this question had been considered and decided by Secretary Wilbur of the Department of the Interior in 1933 and he had decided that under the reclamation law the standing practice of the law dating at least from 1910 and the legislative history of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, the excess land laws were not intended to apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.739" offset="2966340">The Secretary -- I am digressing slightly from the standing issue but not much, Mr. Chief Justice, Secretary Ickes followed him and came to the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.956" offset="3007195">There was pending a confirmation proceeding in the state court, as required by the federal law, 43 U.S.C. 511, and as requested by the contract, to determine the validity of this contract, at coming to trial on March 9, Secretary Wilbur went out of office on March 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.207" offset="3104162">In February, in response to inquiries from the district as to whether he would inform the court of what his decision had been, he wrote a letter which was submitted to the court which said that early in the negotiations it had been -- the determination had been reached that I just described.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.339" offset="3204681">Mr. Griswold refers to all of this in his memorandum and to the fact that five succeeding secretaries adhere to this ruling as a good reason why it is not in the interest of good government for the United States to appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.724" offset="3718248">After the Court's opinion and decree had come down, and it never mentions either one of them, it held that all the Secretaries before Secretary Udall had been wrong -- these were Wilbur originally, followed -- the other secretaries didn't undertake to determine the merits but simply regarded this matter as settled -- these were Krug, Chapman, Seaton, and so on, and now we know from Solicitor General Griswold's memorandum that Secretary Morton also agreed, so altogether there are seven secretaries in five presidential administrations who followed this rule that the economy existing in 1929 was not meant to be dismantled and destroyed by a statute that directed that these same protected rights be served and not taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.742" offset="4274343">The irony is intensified by the fact that the very same group have brought a suit in District Court to enforce the residency requirements of the reclamation law, and that had been decided in their favor and was appealed by the United States and that case was decided by the Ninth Circuit in the same opinion that decided this, held that the same group did not have standing to enforce a residency requirement because there is no assurance that they would be the lucky buyers, but turned right around and held that they did have standing in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.063" offset="4403597">Now, there is one added item on standing, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.453" offset="4421151">The statute under which this action is brought, which is section 46 of the 1926 Omnibus Adjustment Act, provides that the Secretary's authority to fix the price on resale, that is on sale of the excess lands by the original owner, shall expire when half of the debt to the United States has been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.942" offset="4511117">Now, that happened while the case was on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.025" offset="4523447">The Imperial Irrigation District succeeded in repaying more than one-half of the original debt to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.302" offset="4552600">So if the Yellen group ever had standing, it disappeared when the Secretary lost his authority to fix the price on the sale of the excess lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.815" offset="4590634">Now, this was brushed aside by the Ninth Circuit on rehearing, but we say they never had standing, if they did they lost it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.215" offset="4624280">And if the Yellen group didn't have standing to file an appeal from the judgment against the United States, that judgment remains res judicata against the United States in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.904" offset="4670986">The case should not have been in the Court of Appeals, it shouldn't be here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.070" offset="5879620">The central issue in this case, as Mr. Ely has made clear, is what Congress intended in 1928 when it passed the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.215" offset="5928208">There is somewhat of an unreal quality about that question because we know that its answer is one that in the true historical sense we can't define today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.175" offset="5980035">No one today has the capacity to look back fifty years and say with certitude what Congress intended in 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.371" offset="6032906">The legislative history which has been itemized in the briefs seems to indicate almost overwhelmingly that there was no intention to impose a brief limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.759" offset="6094451">But even with that evidence we can't be certain we are engaging in some reasoned conjecture when we as counsel assert what is clear and what is not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.764" offset="6142412">But there is in this case a core of fact that we don't have to conjecture about, we don't have to speculate about and it is really the essence of this case and it is the human experience of what happened after 1928, beginning with Secretary Wilbur's ruling, the judicial proceedings in Hewes and the lives that the people in Imperial Valley built on that foundation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.053" offset="6291623">That human experience is what should be controlling in this case, I suggest, not syllogisms about statutory syntax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.299" offset="6340524">The fundamental practical fact of the matter is that the contemporaneous construction of this act which was begun in 1931 when the government negotiated the contract with the valley, is the bedrock upon which this valley's economy and legal order has been based for almost fifty years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.257" offset="6444387">That bedrock started when the contract was negotiated, it was perpetuated when the electors of the district approved the contract, it was solidified when Secretary Wilbur ruled that acreage limitation did not apply, it was farther solidified when the contract was placed in judicial proceedings, the matter was put in issue, and it was adjudged that acreage limitation does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.776" offset="6562461">Now, those events aren't conjectural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.175" offset="6572074">Those are the bedrock events in this valley's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.531" offset="6593494">And we are not dealing with a situation where we have an administrative construction that you can overrule prospectively with only minimal impact on people's lives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.290" offset="6824521">That is right, and it is permissible because of the language of the statute, because of what transpired in Congress when Reclamation Commissioner Mead said acreage limitation would not apply, because of what happened in Congress when Congressman Swing said acreage limitation would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.520" offset="6893484">There is a whole host of grounds upon which one can base Secretary Wilbur's construction, including the governmental practice which was embodied in regulations at that time, dating back to 1906, respecting vested rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.079" offset="6971643">The administrative practice in this case has given rise to reliance that is widespread and not conjectural, and the reliance of private individuals in this case is awesome in its dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.431" offset="7037053">Since the 1930's virtually every transfer of land in this valley has assumed the validity of what Secretary Wilbur said and what the Hewes Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.808" offset="7078640">Virtually every family that has farms in the valley today has at one time or another committed the bulk of its resources to acquiring farmland at market prices, reflecting the land's assumed entitlement to a perpetual supply of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.862" offset="7146872">Farmers have made enormous investments in sub-surface drainage tile, concrete-lined ditches, leveling their lands, purchasing equipment, all premised on what has to be one of the most fundamental expectations human beings can have in an agricultural community, the assumed security of the water rights appurtenant to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.351" offset="7236733">And you have literally hundreds of human arrangements that have been built on this bedrock, testamentary trusts, inter vivos trusts, mortgage financings, estate plannings, all of which would be unwound if today we denied the legitimacy of the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.440" offset="7321161">I would like to refer to one example to give you a feel for the concrete facts in this case, and that is the situation of petitioner Charles Nilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.005" offset="7359404">He appeared at the trial and testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.024" offset="7371421">Mr. Nilson was born in this valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.973" offset="7379257">He lived on a 130-acre farm his father homesteaded in 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.930" offset="7399111">When he graduated from high school in the valley, he went into the service in World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.920" offset="7419068">He came out, he and his two brothers joined in partnership to begin farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.467" offset="7445191">Over the years they put together a 970-acre tract in which Mr. Nilson owns a one-third interest and that is his excess acreage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.765" offset="7490435">Throughout the 1940's and the fifties they acquired this tract in little bits and pieces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.971" offset="7515303">It was land which during the depression had gone out of production because it was salt poisoned, virtually worthless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.905" offset="7546964">They acquired it as best they could afford it at $10 and $13 an acreage prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.388" offset="7568906">It took them on an average five years per 160 acres to bring that land into production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.040" offset="7595551">They had to deep plow it to a depth of four feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.383" offset="7608926">They had to do that twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.505" offset="7613419">They had to install tile drainage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.448" offset="7625122">That land today is what it is because of that man's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.218" offset="7644244">Its value is because of what he put in it, not because of governmental beneficence, and that illustrates another fact in this case, and that is that those who would like to acquire Mr. Nilson's land at $25 an acre don't really have any fundamental equities in support of the opportunity they seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.048" offset="7743613">They haven't declamentally relied on the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.277" offset="7756466">They haven't declamentally relied on an expectation that the past will be rewritten.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.475" offset="7777259">They haven't relied on Mr. Nilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.567" offset="7785618">They just want an opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.443" offset="7801187">So what is really at stake here is not an abstract proposition but a very practical realistic thing as to who is going to own this land, who is going to farm it, those that have reclaimed it and farmed it or someone new.</text>

            <text syncTime="2003.259" offset="8116433">A final and I think most practical consideration in this case is the contemporaneous vantage point from which those who construed the act originally made their decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.152" offset="8256031">Porter Dent, who wrote Secretary Wilbur's ruling, was the Chief Counsel of the Bureau of Reclamation, a career government attorney who had been Chief Counsel of the Bureau of Reclamation since 1924.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.021" offset="8527496">He was the government's principal witness in the hearings preceding that enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2118.375" offset="8576920">And clearly if Dr. Elwood Mead had thought that non-application of acreage limitation was an affront to national policy or reclamation law he would have said so in Congress, but he stood in Congress with Congressman Swing and said this act will not apply to acreage limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.560" offset="8649644">And clearly if he thought that what he was saying was an affront to national policy, he would hardly have arranged for the bureau's counsel to assist the district in defending against the allegations made in the Hewes proceeding about the 160-acre limitation question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.797" offset="8718608">When that question arose in litigation in 1933, Dr. Mead arranged for the government to send counsel to help on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.227" offset="8760299">Clearly if anyone had thought, if there had been any serious thought by these men who knew what acreage limitation policy was, that the Wilbur ruling was wrong, these events couldn't have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.938" offset="8819127">And that is pure plain fact which we can't escape from today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.383" offset="8832920">We can stand here today as latter day historians and speculate about what administrative practice was in the thirties or the twenties or about what Congress intended, but Mead and Dent didn't have to speculate, they took part in the events of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.979" offset="8891329">They knew what the events of the day were, and their interpretation as a real practical matter is far more likely to reflect the reality of what Congress intended in 1928 than any hypothesis constructed by counsel today, whether it is counsel for petitioners or respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.297" offset="8976593">Now, in circumstances like these where there is every practical reason to respect the past, we come to the pragmatic test which Mr. Justice Rehnquist referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.422" offset="9021106">It is a test which this Court has always applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.287" offset="9032495">It says that every reasonable doubt should be given to the status quo, if there is any basis and reason for argument in support of the status quo it should be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.217" offset="9088188">As this Court said in United States v. Midwest Oil, that is a wise and quieting rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.321" offset="9112639">It is a necessary rule if government is to remain a practical affair intended for practical men, and I would submit that that same thought was what Solicitor General Griswold expressed in 1971 when he made his decision not to authorize an appeal of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.803" offset="9194559">As he said, the essence of this case is essentially a question of good administration of the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.291" offset="9864547">The government views this case as essentially one of statutory construction requiring the Court to decide whether the Congress intended to exempt the Boulder Canyon Project from the excess acreage limitation that has been an important part of reclamation law since the enactment of the Reclamation Act of 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.600" offset="9965798">Central to legislation to dispose of the public lands has been a commitment to attempt to establish an independent yeomanry of small family farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.117" offset="10015848">This was first evidenced as early as 1862 in the Homestead Act which provided an acreage limitation of 160 for a single holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.041" offset="10071542">But it soon became evident that this acreage limitation would not apply in the arid lands as the Plain States were occupied because 160 acres was too small a holding for grazing and the average homesteader lacked the capital resources to permit irrigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.608" offset="10161821">There was a short lived Desert Land Act of 1897, with an expanded maximum acreage allowance of 640 acres, but this was abused when speculators began to amass large tracts by what has been characterized by one writer as fraudulent evidence of water having been brought onto the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.357" offset="10256802">Someone would bring a pail of water and spill it and that affidavit would follow and the land would be given to the speculator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.581" offset="10289716">With this prelude and against the backdrop of the drought decade of 1886, the Reclamation Act of 1902 was enacted with a limitation of 160 acres as the maximum amount of private land in single ownership that is eligible to receive water from a reclamation project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.538" offset="10381563">The Reclamation Act was amended and strengthened in a series of successive statutes that culminated in the Omnibus Adjustment Act of 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.401" offset="10429001">Section 46 of which provided in part that no water should be delivered upon the completion of a new project until a contract shall have been entered into between the Secretary of the Interior and an irrigation district providing for repayment of the project cost and providing for recordable contracts to be entered into by the holders of excess acreage, that is to say, acreage in excess of 160 acres for an appraisal of the excess by the Secretary and an agreement by the owner of the excess to dispose of this property under terms fixed by the Secretary and at prices not to exceed the appraised value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.800" offset="10638608">I think we would differ with my brother who has argued earlier and perhaps with the respondents who will follow us in this respect We read section 46 to provide that the Secretary should not appraise it at the desert price, as was stated, but at a price that would not take cognizance of the improvement of the project, and in the case of the Imperial Valley where there was water previous to the Boulder Project, that that would be the value of the land, the land favored by that water, irrigated by that water which would be less, we submit, than the value of the land receiving the Boulder Dam water which was more regular, more dependable and not subject to the vagaries of our foreign affairs with our neighbor to the south.</text>

            <text syncTime="2830.418" offset="11424998">That's correct, and I think it is significant here to consider what happened before the Boulder Project was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.467" offset="11465226">Judge Warrenburg recounts this history in his opinion, the opinion which is before the Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.802" offset="11494588">And of course, the Colorado River as it flowed south roughly along the boundary of Arizona and California flowed into Mexico and through Mexico into the Gulf of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.141" offset="11551953">Through the efforts of the predecessors of the Imperial Irrigation District, some of its water was diverted into a dry river bed, the Alamo River, which preceded west and then northerly into what is now the Imperial Valley where there was a decline of the land northward, and it irrigated that valley before this project works of Boulder Dam, now the Hoover Dam, and Lake Mead and the other project works were established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.827" offset="11694686">These lands received that water prior to this project, but not under the circumstances they receive it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.969" offset="11731257">As a matter of fact, I'm sure the Court is familiar with the history of this project when in 1905 the Colorado River breached its banks and flowed north in such abundance that it almost washed out the Imperial Valley, went into the Saltan Sink and created the current Saltan Sea, 333,000 acres of water, and this still persists since 1905.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.077" offset="11843688">Then there were drought periods where there was no water available to the lands and the uncertainty of having the lands flooded as dramatically as they were when the Saltan Sea was created or dry because the river was not dependable during the summer months is the difference between what this project meant to the Imperial Valley and what was there previous to its enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3635.936" offset="14647150">This case concerns the applicability of the anti-monopoly provisions of reclamation law to the Imperial Valley of California.</text>

            <text syncTime="3670.178" offset="14784136">The subsidy involved in this case is far different from any other subsidy which probably has ever come before this Court and which has been considered by the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3733.703" offset="15038151">There is nothing wrong with subsidies per se, but Congress intended that subsidy be used for a specific purpose to create a class of small family farmers, not large farmers, small farmers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3771.355" offset="15188825">Well, the answer to that question, Mr. Chief Justice, is this, there are proposed regulations to cover this very point which are set out in the appendix to the district's brief, and the Secretary of the Interior has proposed that there be a limit to the amount of acreage which may be leased.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.279" offset="15264475">There is a limit of 160 acres that may be leased.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.441" offset="15277119">In addition, the land-owner, as I understand it, may own 160 acres.</text>

            <text syncTime="3805.347" offset="15324766">Your Honor may know that at this very moment on Capitol Hill there is a bill, S. 14, which was approved by the Senate, it is now before the House, and one of the biggest battles over changing the reclamation program was over the question of leasing, how much lend should a landowner be allowed to lease without violating the excess land laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.922" offset="15407104">The answer is that the Secretary has discretion under section 10 of the Reclamation Act to adopt rules and regulations to carry out the policies of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.288" offset="15448482">Clearly, the policy of the law as enunciated by Congress and as approved by this Court in Ivanhoe is that there be small family farms of 160 acres.</text>

            <text syncTime="4331.372" offset="17428877">Now, nobody in this case has yet come up with a reason for the inclusion of section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="4337.708" offset="17454164">The petitioners have not pointed out any meaning to section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.038" offset="17475480">It is mere surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.909" offset="17483003">They claim that everything is otherwise provided because there is a specific manner of contracting in section 4(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="4853.559" offset="19517628">That was the rule and that was a rule agreed to -- which was set out in one of Mr. Dent's memoranda in 1927 and a Solicitor's opinion in 1927, and it turns out that once in a while on a project you will have one or two people who are right there right next to the existing stream and the stream isn't changed, but the government will take water out of the stream and the stream is then appropriated and they allow these people to use the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.624" offset="19633821">But that is a far different situation than the Imperial Valley, where everybody was using the water and they went to Congress, the water program was not satisfactory, they couldn't continue to use it, they had periodic droughts and floods in addition to the revolutionary conditions in Mexico, and they had to have this project.</text>
