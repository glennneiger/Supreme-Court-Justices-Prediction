            <text syncTime="2407.521" offset="9733413">That's simply not the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2425.829" offset="9806660">But that -- that Section is simply the Section that's contained in all council manager charters which prohibits exactly the type of thing that Paul Roberts did in this case, that is, interfering in the discharge process in the event that that is the decision of this Court that he did that.</text>
