            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="15.231" offset="164342">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.859" offset="170820">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.575" offset="177716">This case is here on direct appeal from the District Court here in the District of Columbia because a single judge of that Court has declared unconstitutional and enjoined the Secretary of Labor from enforcing the civil penalty provisions of the child labor statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.080" offset="247724">Specifically, Judge Gasch found that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is violated by the last sentence of Section 16 (e) of the child labor statute, which provides that the sums collected by the Secretary as civil penalties may be applied towards reimbursement of the cost of determining child labor violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.837" offset="338735">The facts of this case may be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.019" offset="351483">Appellee runs a chain of restaurants in the southeastern United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.104" offset="371754">In 1969, 1973 and again in 1974, Department of Labor compliance officers found that appellee had employed a number of busboys and waitresses in violation of the federal child labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.300" offset="436537">When two more such instances came to light in March 1975, the Department ordered an investigation into the hiring practices in all of appellee's restaurants.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.970" offset="479274">Thereafter, the Assistant Regional Administrator of the Employment Standards Administration, which is the part of the Department of Labor that enforces the child labor laws, cited appellee for 169 separate child labor violations and assessed the civil penalty of $103,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.165" offset="551999">This sum represented a penalty of $300 each for unlawfully implying -- employing seven persons under the age of 14, plus a penalty of $100 each for unlawfully employing 162 persons under the age of 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.045" offset="623574">In addition, the Assistant Regional Administrator assessed the penalty of $500 for each of the 169 children, or a total of $84,500, because he believed that the history of child labor violations in appellee's restaurants stretching back to 1969, showed that appellee had been aware of the child labor violations but had done nothing to correct them.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.516" offset="717406">Now, appellee filed an exception to this citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.689" offset="730154">And after a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge found that the existence of the child labor violations was clearly established, but he disagreed with the Assistant Regional Administrator on whether these violations were willful.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.592" offset="781772">The Administrative Law Judge therefore struck the $84,500 assessment and reduced the civil penalty to $18,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.681" offset="822105">Now, appellee did not seek judicial review of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.492" offset="837360">Instead, several months later, it began these lawsuits seeking a declaratory judgment that Section 16 (e) is unconstitutional and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="232.414" offset="1033070">That -- well, that's -- he could've raised it earlier, but I think the first time he could have had -- it could have had any expectation of relief was in an Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.367" offset="1060864">That's -- that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.586" offset="1069746">Now, as I mentioned a moment ago, the District Court agreed with appellee's contentions, relying on a line of cases beginning with Tumey against Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.696" offset="1102137">Judge Gasch held that the reimbursement provision of Section 16 (e), and I quote, “Creates a situation in which bias may creep into the decisions of the regional office -- officials who impose civil penalties, that the statute is therefore invalid under the Due Process Clause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="266.372" offset="1168906">Now, it's the Government's position that the injunction entered by the District Court is erroneous for three separate reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.656" offset="1193984">First, we submit that the due process standards established in cases such as Tumey and Ward versus Village of Monroeville, are applicable with full force only to officials exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.028" offset="1251453">Second, even assuming that those standards do apply to the situation in this case, we contend that the court below erred in concluding that the child labor civil penalty scheme creates a significant risk of personal or institutional bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.490" offset="1313311">And finally, even if the reimbursement provision of Section 16 (e) does violate due process, the court below should have enjoined only the enforcement of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.597" offset="1353749">It should've left the remainder of the civil penalty statute enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.001" offset="1371408">Acceptance of any of these three arguments would require reversal of the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.368" offset="1392828">I'd like to turn first to our broadest contention, which is that the principles recognized in cases such as Tumey and Ward are inapplicable here because the Assistant Regional Administrator in citing an employer for violation of the child labor laws and assessing a proposed penalty is acting as a plaintiff for a prosecutor and not as a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.348" offset="1480808">The basic notion that underlies Tumey and Ward is that a litigant is entitled to have his case adjudicated by someone who is free of any substantial likelihood of personal or institutional bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.979" offset="1535248">The Court in those cases struck down statutory schemes that in the court's words, “Offered a possible temptation to the average men as judge, to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead and not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused.”</text>
            <text syncTime="376.750" offset="1610376">Now, we certainly have no quarrel with these principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.309" offset="1624586">But they cannot be easily transferred, we think, to situations such as this one involving governmental officials exercising prosecutor of rather than adjudicative functions.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="389.532" offset="1661471">Mr. Geller, let's assume on mine run prosecutor, just an ordinary prosecutor and -- and let's say that his compensation depended entirely upon the fines assessed against people, he was able to get a court to convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.384" offset="1736913">Would there be any constitutional problem there?</text>
            <text syncTime="410.585" offset="1745690">I don't know of any case.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.792" offset="1750497">I don't -- well, there is a case in fact, because Tumey against Ohio and there was another aspect of Tumey which involved that and was not challenged by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.358" offset="1780799">In fact, this Court had language in its opinion which I hope to quote to the Court which said that that would be all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.093" offset="1803786">I don't see any due process from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.496" offset="1809324">It might be an unwise piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.213" offset="1820191">But I -- defendants entitled as a matter of due process to a fair and impartial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.320" offset="1840671">I don't know of any case that holds any decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.950" offset="1855195">Certainly, that holds that is a matter of due process, he's entitled to a neutral and impartial prosecutor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="455.636" offset="1925935">I think that in light of the traditional deference which courts have given to decisions by the executive branch of who to prosecute and what to prosecute for, that there would -- there would not be a prophylactic or pro se rule -- per se rule such as the Court imposed on judges in cases like Tumey.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.248" offset="1992391">I think it would be up to an individual defendant, if he wanted to get the charges against him dismissed to show that his particular prosecution was somehow motivated by some improper or invidious reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="496.579" offset="2089671">If this -- this apparently, is a means of -- of getting some funds without having them appropriated by Congress directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.125" offset="2127914">Is that the case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="507.278" stopTime="821.783">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="507.278" offset="2132511">Well, the -- one of the unfortunate aspects of this case is that there's nothing in the legislative history to explain why the reimbursement provision worked its way into the statute, but I think that that is a very reasonable speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.025" offset="2179427">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.484" offset="2181308">We're not dealing with very large sums of moneys here as I tend to get to in a moment in terms of ESA, the Employment Standard Administration's total budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.187" offset="2216103">But I think that you're right, Mr. Chief Justice, that in part, it was a desire by Congress to place some of the costs of investigating and prosecuting child labor violations on the perpetuators of those violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.425" offset="2277021">Now, in our view, the appropriate standard of judicial review should be different when scrutinizing factors that arguably influence the institution, rather than the adjudication of civil or criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.416" offset="2333027">And as I say, I think that's treated well to the traditional -- judicial deference to prosecutorial discretion in bringing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.045" offset="2363538">In fact, the Court recognized this crucial distinction of the Tumey case itself, because Tumey involved an Ohio liquor control ordinance which provided that the town mayor who sat as a judge in prosecutions under the ordinance, would receive fees in addition to his salary, if he convicted the defendant, but not if he acquitted the -- the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.182" offset="2444100">The Court found this provision to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.454" offset="2457161">There is another part of the very same ordinance that was involved in Tumey which provided that 50% of the fines collected were to be placed in a so-called secret service fund, for the purpose of enforcing the prohibition laws and the ordinance specifically provided that 15% of any fine was to go to the deputy marshals, 10% of the fine was to go to the prosecutor, and 15% was to go to the town detectives as compensation for their services in enforcing the liquor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.062" offset="2567607">And no one challenged of the legitimacy of these latter provisions of the ordinance in Tumey, involving law enforcement officers rather than adjudicative officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.712" offset="2602193">The fact the Court expressly stated at the ends of -- end of its opinion that in contrast to the situation with judges, the legislature and I quote, “May and often ought to stimulate prosecutions for crime by offering to those who shall initiate and carry on such prosecutions rewards for thus acting and the interest of the State and the people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="646.024" offset="2687457">We think this proposition should govern the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.614" offset="2701876">Now, appellee's answer to this argument is essentially to assert that ESA Assistant Regional Administrators function much like judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.783" offset="2734477">But there's simply nothing in the child labor statute or the accompanying regulations to support that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.757" offset="2758405">Regional Administrators don't preside over hearings or make findings of fact based upon evidence presented in an adversary context.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.031" offset="2791528">In issuing a notice of violation or assessing a proposed penalty, they act just like in Assistant United States Attorney, in determining what charges to bring or what relief to seek as in a civil complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.107" offset="2839803">And most importantly, perhaps, if the employer disagrees with the Assistant Regional Administrator's determination, either of that, there is a violation or what the penalty should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.725" offset="2878255">It may seek review and it's entitled to de novo review before the Administrative Law Judge who's unquestionably neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.938" offset="2907094">And the Administrative Law Judge's ruling is then subject to judicial review in an Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.863" offset="2934784">It's clear then that an Assistant Regional Administrator in imposing a civil -- a child labor violation and assessing a proposed penalty, does not act as a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.540" offset="2973550">And that the standards developed in Tumey and Ward for assuring the neutrality of judges, do not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.926" offset="2999045">Our system contains a number of incentives both direct and indirect, to motivate executive branch officials to do their job diligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.458" offset="3033213">And Section 16 (e) is one such incentive because it stimulates child labor enforcement which Congress prior to the 1974 amendments thought was an area that had been sort of neglected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.675" offset="3082115">We submit that Congress's efforts to achieve this beneficial result, and as I said, to impose some of the causes of ferreting out child labor violations on those who perpetrate the violations, it's not inconsistent with any notions of fundamental fairness embodied in the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.479" offset="3153272">Now, if the Court disagrees with this contention and holds that the Assistant Regional Administrator's assessment of civil penalties for child labor violations is subject to the due process standards of Tumey and Ward, we believe that the judgment below must still be reversed because any possibility of bias resulting from the reimbursement provision is wholly insubstantial and remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.076" offset="3247626">This Court stated in Tumey and indeed Judge Gasch acknowledged that due process does not prohibit the exercise even of judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.772" offset="3286497">When the judicial officer's personal interest is so remote, trifling or insignificant that it may fairly be -- supposed to be incapable of affecting his judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.358" offset="3328815">And that describes the situation in this case.First, as I said in response to the Chief Justice's question, unlike in Tumey, here, no labor department official stands to benefit even by $1 personally from any civil penalty assessment.</text>

            <text syncTime="923.889" offset="3798915">Well, in Tumey and Ward, the amounts that were involved represent that almost half of the town's budget is quite substantial and there was direct evidence in each of those cases that the mayor was quite concerned about the possible loss of that revenue source.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.681" offset="3858056">Now, here by contrast, the evidence shows that the sums collected as civil penalties represent less than 1% of ESA's total budget and that far from being fiscally dependent on these moneys, ESA in each of the year since this reimbursement provision was enacted, has turned back to the Treasury as unused funds, an amount far greater than was even collected as civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.587" offset="3949693">So it's quite difficult to imagine how any Assistant Regional Administrator would be influenced to even the slightest extent by the possibility that some of the moneys collected as civil penalties which child labor violations might be returned to his office at some later point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.069" offset="4279672">Because the amounts that the Assistant Regional Administrator's assess are really irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.661" offset="4302033">It's the amounts that are collected and anyone who challenges the assessment gets de novo review before the Administrative Law Judge who can reduce the amount of the penalty to zero or any figure between zero and the amount initially assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.703" offset="4354173">Now, I'd like to turn briefly in -- few minutes remaining to an issue that the Court need not reach unless it agrees with Judge Gasch that the reimbursement provision, Section 16 (e) renders the civil penalty statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.094" offset="4407777">That's the question of the proper remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.155" offset="4420002">District Court struck down the entire civil penalty statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.341" offset="4432750">It's our position that that remedy is overbroad and totally unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.987" offset="4455320">That at most, the District Court should've severed the last sentence of Section 16 (e) providing for the reimbursement of civil penalty funds that are actually collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.329" offset="4492727">Question of severance, of course, is essentially one of legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.980" offset="4511326">In this case, there's strong proof that Congress would have wanted to have a civil penalty statute without any reimbursement provision rather than have no civil penalty remedy for child labor violations at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.263" offset="4560436">First, the statute contains a broad severability clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.896" offset="4574960">And second, the legislative history of Section 16 (e) shows that Congress' overriding concern was to provide the Department of Labor with a new tool to strengthen child labor enforcement, because the injunctive and criminal provisions of the prior law were found to be totally ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.708" offset="4642252">This congressional objective would obviously be frustrated if the entire civil penalty statute were struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.546" offset="4669524">The last and best piece of evidence perhaps that Congress would have wanted the reimbursement provision severed, if it were found unconstitutional, is that in a number of similar civil penalty statutes, Congress has provided that the funds collected as civil penalty shall go into the United States Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.941" offset="4735143">And that's the result that would occur here if the last sentence of Section 16 (e) were severed from the rest of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.765" offset="4762415">So, for all these reasons, we believe that the District Court erred in declaring the civil penalty statute under the child labor laws unconstitutional and in enjoining its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.750" offset="4806405">And we believe that the judgment below should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1236.048" offset="5047568">Secondly, the Administrator and his assistant acting under Section 16 (e), are judges under the clear statutory language under Section 16 (e) and they cannot be likened to prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.993" offset="5115382">Third, potential for bias and actual bias under Section 16 (e) is very substantial and not remote.</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.052" offset="8915571">First, the argument is made that we're entitled to de novo review by the Administrative Law Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.348" offset="8936782">We do not believe the statutory language permits the Administrative Law Judge to give us a -- a judicial review or de novo review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.703" offset="8970219">The language of the statute permits a party who is -- has been assessed to fine -- an employer assessed to fine with the right to a hearing only under very limited conditions, expressly limited to an objection by the employer to the determination that the violations actually occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.356" offset="9052766">So for example, if an employer was charged with 169 violations of the child labor laws and in fact those violations occurred, he could not obtain a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, as to the reasonableness of the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.191" offset="9132178">And this -- that is the clear and unequivocal reading of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.561" offset="9153599">It is our contention that this is -- as was the argument that was made by the Department of Labor in this particular case before Judge Gasch, and it is our contention that it was made in other cases by -- by the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.073" offset="9215666">And there is one specific Administrative Law Judge that did in fact, hold that in light of the fact of the employer only objected to the reasonableness of the penalties assessed, rather than the fact that the violations actually occurred, that he could not give him an administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.826" offset="9290689">And consequently, we -- we assert that we -- that the administrative -- the Administrator of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Assistant Administrator is in fact a judge and under Section 16 (e) and not can -- not be likened to a prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.752" offset="9378356">Also, I'd like to make the point that in the instance of -- unlike a prosecutor in this instance, the Assistant Regional Administrator sets the penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.599" offset="9417749">He has the discretion and the mandate on the Congress to determine what -- how much of this $1000 fine should be set.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.831" offset="9450663">The prosecutor doesn't set the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.808" offset="9462575">The prosecutor moreover, doesn't get to keep the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.703" offset="9474173">The penalty goes to the Treasury of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.006" offset="9483368">It doesn't go back to the office to reimburse the prosecutor for his expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.533" offset="9505520">Again, as we see no reason why the prosecutor -- the prosecutor (Inaudible) could get the increase of salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.876" offset="9546898">I also like to make the point that -- that in -- in truth in fact, that it is not so much the Assistant Regional Administrator who assesses these fines, who raise the first charge in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.929" offset="9599039">It really is the Employment Standards Administration of Washington D.C.</text>

            <text syncTime="2629.461" offset="10621262">I think that he would have to relay any enumeration to himself, to reimbursement for the cost of doing work in connection with child labor enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.397" offset="10660968">But, I think the -- the more significant thing is for example in the Atlanta regional office, if -- is the question -- is the Administrator or the Assistant Regional Administrator potential -- is or potential bias here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.872" offset="10718856">And if the man has a budget -- let's assume of a $100,000 a year, to operate his office to employ his secretaries for travel and expense budget, and he can increase that budget by really slapping at two employers in -- by way of civil money penalty fines and increase that budget from $100,000 a year to operate it and get to $200,000, then I think he's got real potential for bias, without even looking into the question whether or not he can increase his salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.897" offset="10842990">Finally, the -- the question of severance, I would like to touch upon in my remaining couple of minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.057" offset="10879561">Actual -- if -- if you were to sever -- if this Court were to sever the reimbursement provision of Section 16 (e) alone, we do not believe we would cure the potential for bias or appearance for bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.777" offset="10934523">Because severance of an unconstitutional section of or the language of 16 (e) would not, in fact, give actual notice to investigators of the Department of Labor or to Assistant Regional Administrators or to Administrators or for that matter of Administrator Law Judges or employers, the language would still read as it -- as it presently reads that the moneys shall be used to reimburse the assessor of the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.030" offset="11059493">Also, severance who ignores the fact that all regulations currently adopted and schedule of fines and instructions to assistants at the Department of Labor in determining the amount of the fines, are predicated on the assumption that the home office, the Washington office, will get its share.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.587" offset="11137755">So what we are suggesting is that even the -- that we'd be back here in the Supreme Court, if you severed the -- the reimbursement provision because we would challenge the constitutionality of the regular -- regulations themselves because they were based on assumption that the Department of Labor was going to get its share of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.091" offset="11227721">And that they did not need the responsibility to set fines on the basis of the gravity of the offenses instructed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.757" offset="11262412">And finally, we do not believe that severance would accomplish congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.282" offset="11288534">Congress directed these moneys should be use to reimburse the Department of Labor and be used for child enforcement purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.228" offset="11316328">If a speculation is going to be made that they'd be just as satisfied to have the moneys go into the Treasury of United States, we question that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.244" offset="11344332">We think they might well have not intended that the existing child labor regulations be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.721" offset="11366275">They might well have intended that these funds be used to revise what we consider to be an unequated and -- and grossly inadequate set of child labor laws which are the primary responsibility in our judgment for the teenage and minor unemployment we have in United States today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.042" offset="11439522">And it's our feeling that those -- that Congress as is actually the case, there is a bill pending in Congress right now that -- that would not only require that the civil money penalty is set and go to the Treasury of United States, but in -- in addition to and as part of the same piece of legislation, would require the Secretary of Labor to completely review existing child labor regulations so as to assure justice in -- in enforcement of this particular statute by having a -- a logical and reasonable set of child labor regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.545" offset="11625514">-- just a few short points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.111" offset="11635858">First, I'd like to lie to rest this notion that Administrative Law Judges might be entitled to reimbursement under Section 16 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.150" offset="11663966">There's absolutely nothing in the statute to backup that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.526" offset="11677445">The Secretary of Labor has never construed the statute that way and as Mr. Justice Blackmun noted, Judge Gasch rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.381" offset="11704926">Section 16 (e) allows reimbursement only to those officers that have supervised the work of assessing and collecting civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.525" offset="11733452">The office in the Department of Labor that supervises the enforcement of the child labor laws is the Employment Standards Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.095" offset="11763754">The Administrative Law Judges are not part of the Employment Standards Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.709" offset="11778173">Moreover, it would raise problems, I think, not only under the Fifth Amendment, but under the Administrative Procedure Act to construe the statutes so that any moneys went to the Administrative Law Judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.721" offset="11818297">And I think it would be a sort of bizarre form of statutory construction to construe a statute so as to make it unconstitutional.</text>
