            <text syncTime="37.971" offset="255248">But this case is not like Maher against Roe and it differs in ways that are central to the constitutional analysis that is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.659" offset="297984">In Maher, the plaintiff complained that the State favored normal childbirth over abortion and this Court held that it was permissible to express a value judgment in favor of childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.821" offset="350647">The value judgment was expressed by use of a medical assistance program in which refusal to fund elective abortions did no violence whatsoever to the medical assistance goals on which that program was grounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.768" offset="422431">If a woman desiring an abortion could not obtain one, she could go through normal childbirth with all medically necessary expenses paid and neither her life nor her health will be put in jeopardy.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.876" offset="654921">That's clear, but that would be true of any state discriminatory action.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.245" offset="680312">That does not prevent the application of the Equal Protection Clause, the equal protection analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.215" offset="6920234">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.338" offset="6936743">We would like to reply to three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.871" offset="6954820">The first point, regards the record in the case below involving the effectiveness of alternative treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.983" offset="6991287">The record does contain the affidavit of Dr. Jasper Williams at the Appendix 97.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.634" offset="7013857">And Dr. Williams did state in his affidavit that alternatives to abortion were available, which were effective and as effective, the State submits that no purposeful discrimination is intended by the Illinois General Assembly to harm the State's interest or the interest in maternal health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.307" offset="7108629">This is also supported in the Appendix 138 by a survey put together by the Center for Disease Control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.022" offset="7147499">That survey concluded that there was no increase in abortion-related complications, observed after the implementation of the Hyde Amendment in the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.321" offset="7196609">It is the willingness of the State of Illinois to fund alternatives to abortion which we believe satisfies within the context of a non-comprehensive medical assistance program for the indigent, the standard of reasonableness.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1791.857" offset="7270797">According to one of a – at least one of the amicus briefs, that's precisely the constitutional vice of what Illinois has done, when it finances sterilization for example.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Wenzel, III</label>
            <text syncTime="1802.283" offset="7312488">The equal protection discrimination that I understand the plaintiffs were making is that Illinois has selected out of all the necessary medical categories of care, solely medically necessary abortions.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Wenzel, III</label>
            <text syncTime="1819.613" offset="7381870">And does finance alternatives, but that is not an accurate statement of Illinois' practice, nor is an inaccurate statement of Illinois' obligations under the Medicaid Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.785" offset="7422516">Illinois can, as this Court recognized in Beal, select which procedures to fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.229" offset="7452296">The Court expressly stated that the State need not fund each and every kind of care or each of every procedure available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.278" offset="7484479">It is that discretion within the Medicaid program, coupled with Illinois' reasonable -- reasonable efforts to fund alternatives to complications of pregnancy, which satisfies the rational basis test for equal protection purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.177" offset="7548113">The second point we want to make is that contrary to the suggestions of the Solicitor General, the Hyde Amendment is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.266" offset="7580400">It's logically and we feel inextricably interrelated with plaintiff's statutory claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.285" offset="7604537">It was placed in issue by all of the defendants and emotions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.887" offset="7622928">And finally, it is before this Court insofar as the final judgment order on review, incorporated the statutory rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.046" offset="7659604">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.845" offset="7698787">There are two points I'd like to make because I do not wish to permit two assertions to go unanswered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.895" offset="7727000">One assertion that was made was that the United States says that death is -- is okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.436" offset="7757093">And I think this was the contention that I heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.427" offset="7773080">This, of course, is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.467" offset="7781230">The other related contention was that the United States places fetal life above maternal life and that explicitly is not so, because the first exception in the Hyde Amendment provides that funding is available when the life of the mother would be endangered, if the fetus were brought to term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.529" offset="7881540">The second point I wish to make is that, since the entire Medicaid Act was passed to help indigents drawing a line within the program, then doesn't punish any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.780" offset="7938487">With those two comments, we will rest on our brief.</text>
