            <text syncTime="8.282" offset="33123">This is case is here by reason of the grant of writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.570" offset="66247">Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes unlawful any practices, procedures or tests that operate to freeze the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.155" offset="136568">But to this general rule, Section 703 (h) of the Act provides an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.428" offset="169691">That Section makes clear that the routine application of a bond fide seniority system is not unlawful under Title 7 even where the employer's pre-Act discrimination has resulted in White people having greater existing seniority rights than Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.541" offset="270106">The present case concerns the application of Section 703 (h) to a particular clause in a California brewery industry collective bargaining-agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.656" offset="322560">That agreement accords greater benefits to permanent employees than it does to temporary employees and the clause in question provides that a temporary employee must work at least 45 weeks in a single calendar year before he can become a permanent employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.763" offset="399047">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that this 45-week requirement was not a seniority system or part of a seniority system within the meaning of Section 703 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="113.520" offset="454008">We granted certiorari and for the reason stated in the Court's written opinion filed with the clerk today, we hold that the Court of Appeals was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.042" offset="504163">Accordingly, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.327" offset="529241">Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case, and Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Blackmun have joined.</text>
