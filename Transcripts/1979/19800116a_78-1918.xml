            <text syncTime="45.401" offset="285027">This Court is quite familiar with the complexities of the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.121" offset="299865">In 1977 Congress substantially amended the Act, including the judicial review provisions of section 307(b)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="57.776" offset="334451">That section now gives original jurisdiction--to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the administrative actions under certain enumerated sections of the Act and other final actions which have nationwide application or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.488" offset="397354">The regional Courts of Appeal are given original jurisdiction over other enumerated sections of the Act and "any other final action of the Administrator under the Act" of local or State-wide effect or application.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.264" offset="468407">We contend, EPA does, that section 307(b)(1) means exactly what it says, that the Courts of Appeal have original jurisdiction to review all action, all final actions by the Administrator taken under the Act and to explain this interpretation first --</text>

            <label>Ms. Maryann Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="141.248" offset="668400">It is not extremely helpful but it is not unhelpful either, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.808" offset="686582">It is obvious that Congress was most concerned with and addressed the problem of allocating venue between the Courts of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and the regional Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.144" offset="739976">Congress did indicate however that they were placing review of all rules and orders of regional, Statewide or local application with the regional Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.435" offset="785115">And this was an expansion of the jurisdiction under the 1977 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.983" offset="811342">Another significant fact is that the House bill that the House Report that this legislative history is in was addressing, at that point the only amendment to what had been the prior section 307(b)(1) was the "any other final action" language.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.316" offset="888665">So the legislative history was addressing that addition to section 307(b)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="202.217" offset="912280">So limited as the legislative history is, it does indicate that Congress was aware of an expansion of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.050" offset="943522">I would like to discuss the particular final action involved in this case and then explain why our interpretation is the most manageable, practical and efficient way of interpreting section 307(b)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="223.403" offset="997021">In August 1971, the Administrator promulgated proposed new source performance standards for stationary sources, which included emission limitations for sulfur dioxides.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.110" offset="1047803">The statute at that time -- and it still does, as amended defines new stationary sources to include sources which were modified or constructed after the date of the proposed regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.986" offset="1103287">And stationary sources were also defined to include fossil fuel-fired steam generating plants such as PPG has at its Lake Charles, Louisiana facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.728" offset="1150307">Now, in May 1975 EPA wrote PPG and asked that PPG provide additional -- not additional, but provide information as to the operation of its facility and what was included on the possibility that the new source performance standards might be applicable to the Louisiana facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.434" offset="1241109">In May and in June of that year PPG responded with their interpretation of whether the new source performance standards would apply or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.411" offset="1284995">They provided detailed diagrams of their facility, purchase order as to when the different parts of the facility, because only one section of the overall facility, chemical manufacturing facility was particularly involved, purchase orders for those parts of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.983" offset="1347271">In October of 1976 EPA concluded that the new source performance standards would be applicable to the facility because of the construction date, the date construction had commenced after the date of the proposed regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.748" offset="1410382">PPG requested a reconsideration of that and submitted additional material.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.992" offset="1431385">A meeting was later held between PPG officials and EPA representatives and EPA concluded that its original determination was still in fact in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.678" offset="1478092">In April of 1977 PPG, as permitted under EPA's regulations, formally asked for a "determination of construction" and along with that "determination" request, which was essentially a request for EPA to reconsider its prior conclusion, PPG submitted a memorandum of law and a memorandum of facts, once again setting out its interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.949" offset="1587179">There is no indication here that PPG was ever prevented from adding all of the material it wanted to to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.149" offset="1623960">Nevertheless, EPA determined in June of '77 that its original conclusion still held, that despite further review of the facility and the standards, that the standards were applicable to PGG's facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.430" offset="1697102">PPG subsequently filed a petition for review with the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.256" offset="1712358">The Fifth Circuit at PPG's request dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction under section 307(b)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="410.455" offset="1745168">The Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress could not have intended to place review of final actions in the Courts of Appeals where the action by the Administrator was based on what it termed was a skeletal record, as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.598" offset="1805772">The Fifth Circuit was also apparently quite influenced by the lack of discovery apparatus, the mechanical limitations that were inherent in Courts of Appeals v. District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.948" offset="1855195">And on that basis, the Fifth Circuit read final action very narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.525" offset="1877452">They did not provide a criteria for interpreting that phrase, however.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.539" offset="1897514">Ms. Walsh, do you agree with the characterization of the Fifth Circuit that the record in this case was skeletal?</text>

            <text syncTime="457.260" offset="1932413">We believe that it was sufficient for EPA to make the determination that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.675" offset="1950072">Granted in comparison to administrative records in other cases where the issue involved, the legal issue and the factual matters are much more extensive, it was small as compared to numerous boxes of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.817" offset="2018617">But it --</text>

            <text syncTime="479.171" offset="2020080">Isn't the real question though not whether it was sufficient for EPA to make the determination but whether it was sufficient for the Fifth Circuit to determine whether the EPA had acted correctly?</text>

            <label>Ms. Maryann Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="489.680" offset="2062085">Well, that analysis of the record goes both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.030" offset="2087476">Was it substantively on the merits; was it sufficient to uphold EPA's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.999" offset="2111404">But the primary question I suppose is.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.254" offset="2120391">Was it -- if record sizes are criteria or jurisdiction or determination of jurisdiction, then that would be the appropriate question.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.238" offset="2160306">We contend, however, that is not the criteria for determining jurisdiction and on that basis it would not be necessary to analyze the size or the quantity of the record.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="526.873" stopTime="545.267">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="526.873" offset="2210879">In your view, if the record is one which is sufficient to satisfy the agency, is it automatically sufficient for appellate review in the Court of Appeals?</text>
            <text syncTime="539.349" offset="2260720">Does it always follow that then it is sufficient for the reviewing court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maryann_walsh" startTime="545.267" stopTime="602.563">
            <label>Ms. Maryann Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="545.267" offset="2284440">Not necessarily, in that if there is a record, and the Administrator's decision must be based on a record to be sustainable, certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.438" offset="2337102">Now, Congress has provided that on petitions for review there will be a sufficient record presented to the Courts of Appeal under 28 U.S.C. 2113.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.893" offset="2382973">That specifies what the agency must certify to the Court of Appeals on a petition for review and that, then, constitutes the reviewable record.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.216" offset="2424247">And that assures, contrary to what the Fifth Circuit assumed in this instance, that a reviewable record will always be presented to the -- an appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.239" offset="2468342">Now, if that standard can't be met, if there is no record to certify, then on that basis there would not be a jurisdiction over that particular action.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.941" offset="2595088">Could the Court of Appeals appoint a special master or a referee to take testimony to fulfill the function that might have been fulfilled by a District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="645.046" offset="2683591">The way to interpret the statute is that what is necessary to supplement the record to determine whether the Administrator's action was sustainable or not would be remand to the agency for supplementation or the other options that would be available to the Court of Appeals which might in some instances be the appointment of a special master.</text>

            <text syncTime="720.844" offset="2986715">Now, certainly that doesn't remove the necessity to analyze the record on its substance under the judicial review of the Administrator's actions as supported by that record.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.126" offset="3035826">Well, I had read the Fifth Circuit's opinion and its use of the word "skeletal" not as meaning that it was less than 20 pages or less than 15 pages, but skeletal in a sense that it was simply correspondence largely between the private party and the EPA; and it was skeletal for purposes of review.</text>

            <text syncTime="758.574" offset="3137703">Well, on the basis that it -- certainly there is that indication in the Fifth Circuit's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.053" offset="3167587">However, on the basis of what it termed a skeletal record it refused to take jurisdiction, determining that the skeletal quality of the record is what prevented it under section 307(b)(1) from taking jurisdiction which then, under the Fifth Circuit's opinion and reading the Fifth Circuit's opinion and reading what the Fifth Circuit did, means that analyzing the record and the skeletal or non-skeletal quality of it is the basis on which jurisdiction must originally be determined under section 307(b)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="802.653" offset="3313977">I think the Fifth Circuit characterization of the record has to be recognized as first going to jurisdiction as well as to the substance of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.057" offset="5739604">The critical factor and the issue we are directed at today is that the rightness or the substantiality of the record, of supporting the Administrator's record -- decision, rather, does not go to determining jurisdiction under 307(b)(1), the language of 307(b)(1) that the indication and the intent of Congress is that jurisdiction be a definite concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.974" offset="5843257">And the way to make it a definite concept consistent with reading the statute is to make exactly what this section says, to make all final actions reviewable in the Courts of Appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1483.885" offset="6038862">And I think that that must be the -- what will happen in every case based on the Fifth Circuit's decision, because they say that the record that was involved lacked some magic quality that would make it reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.072" offset="6095705">Now, the option that is available to the Court of Appeals or the District Court in reviewing administrative action under this Court's line of cases is remand to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.256" offset="6136351">So the Fifth Circuit concentration on the discovery apparatus or the mechanical limitations inherent in the Courts of Appeals was really irrelevant because neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court had that option available to them when reviewing the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.734" offset="6214301">Therefore the most efficient way to interpret section 307(b)(1) and the way that is consistent with the integrity of the statute, the statutory language, is to read it as definite earmark or determination of jurisdiction in the Courts of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.266" offset="6328404">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.191" offset="6340106">We disagree directly on the construction given the other final action catch phrases at the end of those two sentences, at the beginning of section 307(b)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.740" offset="6386291">But every once in a while one of the old Latin statutory construction phrases makes sense when applied in a modern context to the Federal statute or construction problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.003" offset="6435401">We think this is a classic case, actually, for application of the doctrine of statutory construction ejusdem generis to construe the catch phrase at the end of a statutory series like those that are similar to it in the enumeration that proceeds it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.768" offset="6506454">But the key thing I think the Court has to remember in focusing on this case is that the agency is arguing for original, exclusive and preclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals that section 307(b)(2) bars anybody from raising an issue in the enforcement proceedings or anything that would come along subsequently, if that issue could have been raised under a direct review action under section 307(b)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.597" offset="6633723">Now, I recognize that in this particular case the briefing might not be especially helpful, at least the opening brief of EPA is cryptic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.363" offset="6672802">Our responsive brief and EPA's reply are really where the arguments are found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.113" offset="6695790">In addition to the problems of just discussing the type of action that took place in this case, whether it is final, we believe that EPA has misread seriously three statutory provisions, as well as our position in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.120" offset="6751901">What I would like to do is take a few minutes at the outset and summarize our arguments and position and perhaps support the case in the context and then focus on the detailed points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.425" offset="6805086">I remind the Court that Congress established the special judicial review provisions in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.210" offset="6836224">It mandated at that time review in the Courts of Appeals for certain specifically enumerated actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.199" offset="6864123">Other actions were definitely at that time reviewed in District Courts under the generally applicable Federal question jurisdictional grant and then the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.701" offset="6914173">Those other actions or the actions that were brought in District Court included actions to review the application of the new source standards, in fact the application of the new source standards at issue in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.039" offset="6967568">There were a series of District Court actions that took place between 1970 and 1977 on these precise types of matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.634" offset="7009886">In 1977, however, Congress added a number of further specific sections to the listing that was in section 307 and it added those other final action catch words at the end of the two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.691" offset="7070177">Now, EPA's arguments are based on the broadest conceivable reading of those other final action catch words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.363" offset="7100792">They are so broad that they would make the specific listing that precedes it redundant and useless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.397" offset="7129004">The words "special enumeration" might as well not be there at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.095" offset="7155754">You can construe the other final catch words in light of the enumeration, however, because that specified list of actions, both in the first sentence and in the second one, deal with a consistent class of actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.260" offset="7216462">Those actions, if you look at them and analyze them in detail, all are either ruling actions or they are adjudications where EPA has to act on the basis of an opportunity for a hearing to the affected party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.669" offset="7278007">And that opportunity for a hearing brings into play the formal adjudication provisions of section 554 of the APA and it insures that the Court of Appeals has a record available to it for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.734" offset="7338297">And accordingly, and make no mistake about it, our position on jurisdiction is in no way unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.361" offset="7372779">In short, and I would like to reiterate it again, we say that a ejusdem generis construction of the other final action catchwords would include either EPA action which is rule-making or adjudication where the statute on its face provides an opportunity for a hearing, bringing into play section 554 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.422" offset="7493047">We recognize -- the rule-making, by the way, would either have to be subject to section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act or to the further provisions that actually in the Clean Air Act in section 307(d) that displace the Administrative Procedure Act's provisions and are more stringent in certain respects, especially insofar as keeping a docket and making a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.140" offset="7595969">Now, we recognize that ejusdem generis construction construction of the other final action catch words would not include the section 112 reference in listing in the second sentence because section 112, while it refers to hazardous substances, does not call for an opportunity for a hearing on the part of the private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.504" offset="7697429">Section 112 however deals with three different kinds of actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.135" offset="7711953">It deals with an approval by EPA, actually EPA, not a State, of an application or a notice for permission to either build or modify a plant that emits hazardous pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.112" offset="7779871">In the second part it deals with violations of hazardous pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.095" offset="7795754">And in the third part it deals with waivers from that hazardous pollutant standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.599" offset="7817801">Section 112(c) does require in each of these three instances that EPA make statutorily defined findings before it takes its action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.604" offset="7865762">Accordingly, we believe that section 112(c)'s provisions can be taken into account in a ejusdem generis construction of these other final action catch words if the Court wants to, because it could add to the categories of adjudication which are covered by those catch words those actions which are taken by EPA where the statute expressly requires that certain determinations or factual findings to be made in support of its action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.055" offset="7987597">We don't think, and the reason we don't put that forward as a favored construction of the statute is that section 112(c) is an exceptional provision in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.407" offset="8025004">This Court has had the Adamo Wrecking case before it, it knows that the Act has special provisions for enforcement as well as judicial review for hazardous pollutants and we think that section 112(c) is an exception and you don't need to include it within this ejusdem generis class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.767" offset="8102431">But either way, whether the Court would adopt the optional construction or not, you wouldn't have reached the action in the present case because here you don't have the requirement at all stated in the statute that EPA make these types of final determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.741" offset="8166379">We do agree with EPA that it is a final determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.906" offset="8182993">PPG was in the process of building that plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.330" offset="8196681">It was just about built at the time this all started and, indeed, it had to know whether or not those standards in the fossil fuel-fired generating unit requirements that EPA had put forward were applicable or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.542" offset="8261569">It had to govern its conduct by them as it operated this particular plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.835" offset="8282676">We do think in construing the statute that the Court should be particularly concerned about EPA's most expansive reading, because it would really have a strong adverse affect on judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.464" offset="8333249">You heavily burden the Courts of Appeals with review of actions by EPA that were taken outside the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.856" offset="8366791">As Professor Currie points out, anytime you have an adjudication that does not take place under section 554 the agency can go outside the administrative record and grasp grounds for its decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.301" offset="8464593">The first is that you are going to have many more petitions for review filed in the Courts of Appeal under this reading than you are any other reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.814" offset="8502627">And that is because of the review preclusion provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.522" offset="8533452">Unless they carry forward any possible claim they might have within the 60-day time period, they lose, under the Yakus case, the right to review those issues entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.928" offset="8679111">The preclusion provisions get carried along or drug along by the coverage of the judicial provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2904.050" offset="11719555">But that isn't the criteria even for bringing section 554 in play, it is just providing an opportunity for a public hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.656" offset="11749961">And, indeed, 554 as the Court well knows provides summary judgment opportunities in the administrative context and other things, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.029" offset="11779532">But it is the fact that the statute provides an opportunity for a hearing that distinguishes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.105" offset="11807744">Section 119 is precisely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.922" offset="11827075">It provides after notice and a hearing on the record, in several instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.135" offset="11851943">In other words, you get an opportunity for a hearing under section 119 as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.714" offset="11870229">And we think the agency's putting forward this grant denied dichotomy is a mis-reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.177" offset="11904084">And that those two sections do fit within this general plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.566" offset="11929684">And as a matter of fact Courts of Appeals have actually made such construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.100" offset="11959777">But from the reverse vantage point, they have construed the substantive provisions that are actually listed in the special judicial review provision in light of the record desired for Court of Appeals review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.068" offset="12015679">An example -- and it is not cited in our brief -- is the Marathon Oil case at 564 F.2nd 1253.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.085" offset="12411695">And in fact the Marathon Oil case is one of them, because in that case the Court construed the reference, the substantive provisions reference listing in the special judicial review provisions to have some impact on what those actual requirements were for that particular substantive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.144" offset="12491943">And the Court said, actually quoted from the Attorney General's manual on the APA on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.637" offset="12521932">The Attorney General's manual had said that a requirement that administrative decisions beyond the record can be clearly implied in the provision for judicial review in the Circuit Courts of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.846" offset="12566758">That was where the actual statute called for a hearing but didn't say whether you had on the record such that you would also bring 554 into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.176" offset="12608031">And decisions that are consistent with Marathon Oil are the U.S. Steel case in the Seventh Circuit and the First Circuit Seacost Anti-pollution League Case, those are at 556 F. 2d and 572 F. 2d respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.233" offset="12668322">So the courts have used this ejusdem generis idea but they have used it from a reverse vantage point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.836" offset="12698728">There is one final thing I would particularly like to cover and that is EPA's broad construction would actually introduce an internal conflict into section 307 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.886" offset="12746898">As The Court knows, in the first section of section 307 the Courts of Appeals are reviewing, among other things, and it says that EPA's action in promulgating any standard under section 202 of the Act, but then right away a parenthetical clause appears, other than a standard required to be prescribed under section 202(b)(1) of the Act, this section deals with auto emission standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.622" offset="12849821">EPA's broad reading of the catch phrase in the sentence would actually draw back into the ambit of Court of Appeals review that item which is specifically excluded by the parenthetical exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.439" offset="12905096">EPA argues in its reply brief that section 202(b)(1) of the parenthetically exempted part of the statute doesn't call on the agency to take any action which is reviewable in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.274" offset="12964446">That is wrong, and that is wrong for the reasons that are stated in Professor Currie's report to the administrative conference which actually produced the recommendations that went to Congress and formed the basis for the 1977 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.752" offset="13018363">As Professor Currie pointed out, section 202 does require or does have in it particular provisions which call for numbers in the auto pollution standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.063" offset="13087640">Those numbers, for example, are things like 1.5 grams for a vehicle mile hydrocarbons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.199" offset="13116165">But in every case the statute says that EPA standards may not exceed that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.327" offset="13140720">In other words, EPA standards can be more stringent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.708" offset="13150229">And as Professor Currie points out in his report, which is in the Iowa Law Review reprinted there, you have to have court of review or you have to have the opportunity for court review whether or not EPA properly exercised its power to make the standards more stringent than the statutorily set levels or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.850" offset="13226820">And he had concluded at that point that the only possibility of review of course was in District Court under the Federal questions statutes and the Administrative Procedure Act, so a review had to be available there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.836" offset="13270706">And we agree whole-heartedly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3427.116" offset="13811858">I would like to try and show some of the shadows on PPG's bright line of ejusdem generis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.865" offset="13834846">First of all, as we discussed in our reply brief, there are certain actions that the Administrator can take under the Act that are specified in the enumerated portions of 307(b)(1) that would not necessarily be based on the -- a complete formal record, the type that PPG requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.934" offset="13911124">I think one of the mistakes that PPG makes is they assume that every time you have an action made on a record that there will be an opportunity for a hearing and a hearing that is conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.364" offset="13960861">The Administrative Procedure Act in section 553 providing for rule-making requires that rule-making proceed on a notice and an opportunity for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.984" offset="14015300">And that opportunity for hearing may consist of just the type of action taken in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.927" offset="14035048">That is the submission of data, the transfer of correspondence between the agency and the party involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.850" offset="14062738">In other words, PPG assumes, reads into the statute things that are not there, the requirement of what they would call a complete and presumably an APA record in their ejusdem generis provisions of 307.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.266" offset="14140479">It is not provided in the APA, they are asking more than the APA does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.532" offset="14157511">The types of actions that Congress refers to in those enumerated sections are not necessarily the types of actions that would be based on a record after a formal hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.025" offset="14199515">So that looking to ejusdem generis, which is no more than an aid to construction, it certainly should not be referred to as a controlling interpretive principle for this important provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.703" offset="14254164">Looking to ejusdem generis, it does not provide us with a clear definite way of interpreting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.525" offset="14277465">Of necessity it requires a reference to at least one, of not two courts before there is a final -- possibly three courts, before there is a final determination of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.839" offset="14322709">The question was asked as to the burden that would be put on Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.259" offset="14340368">Under our reading of the statute of all references made to Courts of Appeal on petitions for review, certainly PPG's reference or interpretation does not ease the load on the courts.</text>
