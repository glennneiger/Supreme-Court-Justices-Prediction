            <text syncTime="80.098" offset="423790">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.545" offset="437582">This case concerns the validity of a search which occurred at a public tavern in Aurora, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.419" offset="465063">On March 1, 1976, at about 4:10 in the afternoon, a group of at least eight or nine police officers and Illinois Bureau of Investigation agents entered a public establishment by the name of the Aurora Tavern.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.751" offset="522428">Their purpose was to execute a warrant for the tavern, the premises of the tavern, and the bartender, a man by the name of Greg.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.449" offset="553148">Agent Jerome Johnson announced the officers' purpose and authority, and he immediately told everyone in the tavern to stand for a search for weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.384" offset="596929">Present in the tavern at the time were a group of approximately between nine and thirteen patrons, including my client, Ventura Ybarra.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.597" offset="641755">The lighting was sufficient, according to Agent Johnson, for all of these patrons to be seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.411" offset="665057">And he described the tavern as one large room, with one entrance and one exit.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.545" offset="689507">Johnson testified he had never seen any of the patrons before, and despite never having seen any of them before, he then proceeded to pat all of them down.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.074" offset="735692">And he did this even though he testified he had no knowledge that any had committed an offense, and no indication that Mr. Ybarra had a gun or was hostile or was hiding anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.661" offset="781981">Mr. Ybarra's hands were visible to him at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.301" offset="796609">He had no knowledge that Ybarra owned or worked at the premises, which he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.371" offset="812805">He was merely a patron.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.692" offset="834121">In patting down Mr. Ybarra, he testified that he felt no weapon at all during that patdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.814" offset="858676">He felt a cigarette pack with objects in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.247" offset="868394">That was his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.583" offset="873723">He did not see the object immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.094" offset="883754">He completed the patdown of the remaining patrons, a task which took several minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.266" offset="908413">He then returned to Ybarra and he searched Ybarra again.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.049" offset="927535">And he searched Ybarra again, even though he testified that he had no knowledge at that time that Ybarra and any contraband or any of the items they were looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.303" offset="964629">Ybarra hadn't moved between the two searches, and at all times his hands had been on the bar, between the two searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.227" offset="996289">During the second search of Ybarra, the officer found six tinfoil packets containing heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.930" offset="1023143">At the conclusion of the evidence at the hearing on the motion to suppress in Cook County, Illinois, the Prosecutor conceded that there was no probable cause for the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.417" offset="1061073">Instead, he relied on a statute, and that is illinois Revised Statute, Chapter 38, Section 108-9, which says that in executing a warrant a police officer may reasonably detain to search anyone present at the time of the execution, in order to a) protect himself from attack, or b) prevent he disposal or concealment of any of the instruments, articles or things named in the warrant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="263.811" stopTime="275.918">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="263.811" offset="1158666">Independent of the statute, Mr. Goldberg, if the officer observed factors which would have warranted a patdown search under a Terry, what would you say then?</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan D. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="275.918" offset="1207045">If he had observed factors which would have warranted patdown in Terry, he could have performed it without the authority of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.955" offset="1231182">There is little question about that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="284.335" stopTime="323.667">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="284.335" offset="1240691">Mr. Goldberg, does your argument depend at all on a question of degree?</text>
            <text syncTime="290.190" offset="1264097">I notice the Supreme Court of Illinois said, "Obviously, this warrant to search a department store would not authorize the search of everybody in a department store."</text>
            <text syncTime="300.822" offset="1306624">Conversely, suppose that a search warrant had issued for explosives stored in a privately owned cabin, And police executing a search warrant -- say, the cabin dimensions were 10 by 12 -- at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.514" offset="1373393">In it, they found two people.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.869" offset="1382797">Do you think they would have had the authority to make a patdown search of those two people?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_d_goldberg" startTime="323.667" stopTime="346.853">
            <label>Mr. Alan D. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="323.667" offset="1398053">Well, the answer to that, I think, is that the premises are smaller and more private, and the number of people there are less than the reasonable suspicion, goes greater that they are involved in the criminal activity, necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.563" offset="1445595">I think this particular set of facts was a public place and nine to thirteen patrons in a place where there is no reason to suspect an involvement is far beyond any line that might t be drawn.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="346.853" stopTime="348.959">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="346.853" offset="1490735">But it is a line-drawing process?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_d_goldberg" startTime="348.959" stopTime="371.207">
            <label>Mr. Alan D. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="348.959" offset="1499199">Necessarily a line would have to be drawn somewhere, but that line, I think, is provided in Terry v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.878" offset="1522918">If the circumstances are such that the officers could reasonably suspect or in the case of -- not a weapon search but a search for contraband, and if they had probable cause, under the circumstances, to believe that the persons were involved in criminal activity, then they could search them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="371.207" stopTime="378.405">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="371.207" offset="1588224">If they had probable cause, there is no doubt they could search them.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.226" offset="1600240">What if they had reasonable suspicion under Terry?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_d_goldberg" startTime="378.405" stopTime="444.348">
            <label>Mr. Alan D. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="378.405" offset="1616959">Well, in your exposes hypothetical, of course, that would be a question of probability of danger to the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.182" offset="1644126">And Terry, of course, is the weapons situation, and reasonable suspicion would be sufficient under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.829" offset="1678712">Now, if they walk into a place and they have only a hunch that a person might be involved, that wouldn't be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.009" offset="1707447">And, traditionally, of course, when you are talking about searching someone for contraband, as opposed to a weapon, the Court has always spoken in terms of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.444" offset="1741197">But the distinction which the State seeks to draw, saying that, "Well, you should only require reasonable suspicion here," I don't think that's one that really has any relevance here, because they had nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.716" offset="1782262">They had no reasonable suspicion or probable cause here.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.121" offset="1795845">Whether you consider it a weapons search or a search for contraband, there was no sort of suspicion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.351" offset="1820818">So those differing degrees in which there are smaller premises, more reason to believe a person is involved, obviously all present closer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.581" offset="1857703">But this particular set of facts, since there was nothing at all, there is absolutely no suspicion of any kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.188" offset="1896155">Well, the bartender was named in the warrant, Greg, and so I would be able to make this argument.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="458.211" offset="1936175">Well, would you say that if it was found by a State court that there was reasonable suspicion that people in that particular bar might well be armed, could the patrons be patted down just for weapons, while they made the search -- before they made the search of the premises?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Alan D. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="479.476" offset="2021230">If there was reasonable suspicion regarding the first patdown, you can be patted down, and there simply wasn't here.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.395" offset="2052995">And then if a weapon were found, and assuming the possession of that weapon concealed on the person, was a violation of Illinois law, then there could be a general search.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan D. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="496.196" offset="2088208">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.487" offset="2113285">Now, the particular portion of this Illinois statute that was relied on was not a weapons section.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.661" offset="2138049">It was no a) to protect themselves from danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.838" offset="2150693">It was b) to prevent the disposal or concealment of any instruments, articles or things named in the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.116" offset="2183816">And it is simply our contention that neither of these searches were performed -- neither the first nor the second -- with reasonable suspicion or probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.669" offset="2214013">There was no articulable standard in that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.478" offset="2225298">The only reason for the search, apparently, was the mere presence of the patrons in the place where the search warrant was being executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.600" offset="2253824">And that is a rationale for search that this Court has consistently rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.021" offset="2519437">And my assertion is they could not have known narcotics dealing was going on, because it wasn't open.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.109" offset="3699858">In my mind, the only thing that one can logically infer to that is that this informant, or anybody who knew that Greg had heroin for sale, could go up to Greg and purchase heroin, but that a lawful patron who walked in to buy a beer would have no way of knowing that narcotics dealing was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.567" offset="3773628">I think this would be true that any time there is some illegal activity going on in a public place, normally, the patrons of that public place are not going to be privy to the information that there is unlawful activity going on there.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.385" offset="3824933">And unless the police can somehow particularize the reason to believe that a particular individual is involved in the unlawful activity, then they cannot search him merely because they have a warrant for the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.616" offset="3881880">The State has offered a new rule to justify the search in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.173" offset="3904031">Their rule is that a patdown is, par se, permissible at the scene of a search warrant, where officers do not have reason to believe that a person has no connection to the premises or the criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.526" offset="3961501">That is set out in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.454" offset="3977174">This rule has, I think, several infirmities.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.639" offset="3985951">First, it violates all the general principles we have been talking about this morning, the rule that mere presence at the scene of suspected criminal activity doesn't lead to an inference that one is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.764" offset="4026389">Second, again, it would make every warrant into a general warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.730" offset="4042271">And it would also apparently put the burden on the person to be searched to avoid being searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.918" offset="4059094">He would have to demonstrate to the officers that he was not involved in the criminal activity, that he was not connected with the premises in order to avoid search, instead of requiring the officers to articulate the reasons why they are searching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.356" offset="4112802">As a result, it could subject virtually anyone to a search, on the basis not of specific knowledge on the part of police, but because they had no knowledge, just because they had no knowledge about that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.353" offset="4160763">Under the State's test, they could search him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.440" offset="4181138">Even if this initial patdown, this first intrusion in the case had been permissible, it wasn't the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.059" offset="4203604">There was a second search here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.762" offset="4210395">Even though the officer testified he hadn't found a weapon, even though all he had felt was what he described as a cigarette pack with objects in it, there was a second search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.271" offset="4244459">He explicitly testified that he believed, after the first search and before the second search, that he had no knowledge that Ventura Ybarra had any contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.986" offset="4283329">That was his very testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.904" offset="4290957">He didn't have any knowledge that Ventura Ybarra had any contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.296" offset="4304541">And despite that he went ahead and searched him again a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.327" offset="4328678">I think the reason why Officer Johnson honestly admitted he had no knowledge is because the feeling through a patdown of a cigarette pack with objects in it can't logically give one any reasonable suspicion of probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.952" offset="4523133">Now, this second search on the basis of no suspicion or probable cause was improper because the feeling of the cigarette package with the object in it could not logically lead one to conclude anything about the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.555" offset="4585618">The officer didn't feel what the objects were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.217" offset="4596276">They could have been a lighter or a book of matches or any other innocent object, and that's why he honestly testified that he didn't have any knowledge that there was any contraband on Ventura Ybarra at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.042" offset="4651551">Now, the State also offers an alternative argument in their brief, and that is that the pat down of all people on the premises when the officers entered was permissible not as a search or weapons but as a search for contraband, based on reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.606" offset="4721768">And, at some length, they discussed whether reasonable suspicion or probable cause should apply in a situation like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.952" offset="4759176">While the decision of this Court would indicate that probable cause is the relevant standard when the search is for contraband, in this case the search would have been impermissible under any standard, because there is no suspicion of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.737" offset="4810271">The only suspicion offered by the State, again, is their assertion that the narcotics dealing was open and notorious, and, as I said earlier, the officer's testimony, the circumstances which confronted the officer, the complaint for search warrant, all indicate that there was nothing about the criminal activity on these premises that was open and notorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.485" offset="4889266">There was no reason to believe that a lawful patron would know of the criminal activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.366" offset="7068818">Illinois submits, Your Honors, that the officers went to the Aurora Tap with a valid search warrant for the premises on March 1st, properly followed the dictates of common police sense in their actions leading to a discovery of six tinfoil packets of heroin on Ventura Ybarra.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.633" offset="7129945">The State suggests that Appellant's criticism of police action here is contrary to common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.287" offset="7152515">Indeed, I think that perhaps the crucial dispute in this case, between both sides, is what amounts to a common-sense reading of, first of all, the complaint for the search warrant, and then the testimony of the police officer at the suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.288" offset="7228479">The two sides really do interpret those documents and testimony in very different fashions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.230" offset="7256273">We maintain that our interpretation, taking the inferences from the logical meaning of these documents, is the correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.753" offset="7298382">Illionis suggest that if the complete position of the Appellant in this case is accepted by this Court that all drug enforcement officers will be less able to lawfully protect themselves from attack in similar situations, while they follow orders to execute search warrants that will, themselves, be rendered more ineffectual.</text>

            <text syncTime="2518.089" offset="10175718">The reason why all the patrons were searched before Ybarra was searched the second time was strictly because security and protection was more important than anything that might have been raised during the first patdown of Ybarra, which regard to the objects in the warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2552.125" offset="10311868">The informant went into the tavern, apparently as a patron, on at least -- he said at least ten other occasions he had been there and had observed tinfoil packets on and about the person of the bartender Greg, in a drawer behind the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.541" offset="10377488">And then on this particular weekend, of February 28-29th, he had seen no fewer than 15 to 25 packets of tinfoil on or about the person of Greg.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.948" offset="13443114">We are not sure of that, but the indication is that he was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.640" offset="13457951">But I am not sure of that either, at least at this point, when the lawsuit went into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.709" offset="13482193">Now, on our second alternative argument, based on what we are telling the Court -- what we are arguing -- is that if Johnson did lack a full traditional probable cause the second search, that search that turned up the tinfoil packets of heroin, he at least had a lesser Camara-type probable cause or a Terry reasonable belief, that the bar and/or his fellow patrons were connected with the illegal drug activity on the premises, and may have had the objects of the warrant concealed on their persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.984" offset="13607267">These are actually two different possible theories on which the Court could affirm the decision below, one of them argued primarily in our relief, the other mentioned in Footnote 10, ascribed to Professor LeFevre.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.225" offset="13656273">Really, regardless of which theory is used, they are both two parallel ways to describe the same basis for the search, the same information and reaching the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.194" offset="13696188">We believe that the lesser reasonable belief test is more appropriate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.857" offset="13726804">That's what we are emphasizing, primarily because it is a matter of consistency with this Court's prior decisions, and also trying to create a level of certainty for police officers to operate under.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.362" offset="13768808">We think either theory could justify the decision of the Appellate Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.562" offset="13785631">And, of course, both theories involve a balancing test which was used in Camara, Terry and other cases that we cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.385" offset="13820949">We feel that under a balancing test -- we feel that we have such strong Governmental interest in the controlling of drug traffic, and very importantly, I think -- very importantly -- we are not dealing here with warrantless search automobile</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.886" offset="14246954">Secondly, that cause was really pre-Terry and pre-Camara, and therefore it never really considered the possibility of a balancing test being appropriate in some situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.240" offset="14296377">Our issue here, our specific issue, was never decided in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.542" offset="14313514">It was really only alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.097" offset="14323754">For the reasons, then, stated in our brief, we simply ask that the Court affirm the judgment below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.873" offset="14370879">All I really wish to say at this point is that although Counsel for the State constantly refers to the Terry opinion, nothing in Terry supports an automatic right to frisk in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.496" offset="14421347">Terry sets forth a standard of reasonable suspicion, reasonable belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.700" offset="14438170">And the State's position, in Part 1 of their brief, is that they can frisk automatically when they are executing a warrant without reasonable suspicion, and Terry simply doesn't support that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.599" offset="14477772">And the only other thing I would say is that, again, the State contends that somewhere in this record there is an indication that drug traffic was open and notorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.267" offset="14508492">I have gone through the factors in the record that I think indicate just the opposite, and indicate that the officer's belief was just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.053" offset="14535555">I would argue until I am blue in the face that it wasn't open and notorious, and the State is really saying nothing any more than contradicting me.</text>

            <text syncTime="3625.512" offset="14605458">And Officer Johnson responds, "During the patdown, I felt some objects that I felt to be heroin."</text>

            <text syncTime="3632.497" offset="14633357">That gets to the other point of whether there was probable cause or reason for suspicion for its second intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.608" offset="14661778">And then at that point the trial attorney objects and the Court says, basically, "You can't tell us what you felt, you have to tell us what you felt, you have to tell us what facts led you to reach that belief."</text>

            <text syncTime="3651.108" offset="14707754">Yes, but that would at least establish a subjective belief on his part.</text>

            <text syncTime="3659.536" offset="14741504">At that point -- this is the preliminary hearing -- it does seem to indicate a subjective belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.874" offset="14758849">Everywhere else in the record he says he doesn't have a subjective belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.365" offset="14776822">At this point, which is about a month before the suppression hearing, he seemed to think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.301" offset="14792600">When he reconsidered his testimony later on, he didn't have that subjective belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.204" offset="14808168">Perhaps, he had realized himself how illogical it was to feel a cigarette pack and think that it contains heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.446" offset="14833142">That was just a hunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.520" offset="14841501">And that also invalidates the second search.</text>
