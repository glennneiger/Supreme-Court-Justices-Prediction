            <text syncTime="80.809" offset="426611">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.680" offset="438105">The question presented by this appeal arises out of a longshoreman's accident on board a ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.792" offset="470497">The longshoreman collected compensation benefits and medical benefits, pursuant to the Longshoremens/Harbor Workers Compensation Act, and at the same time proceeded to bring a third-party action against the ship owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.542" offset="533504">The action against the ship owner was eventually compromised for the sum of $60,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.409" offset="560985">During that interim period, Mr. Bloomer had recovered compensation payments and medical benefits of some $17,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.545" offset="601527">The question therefore is presented whether the recovery in the third-party action, the compensation insurance carrier, the respondent herein, should share proportionately with Mr. Bloomer the costs of affecting the recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.877" offset="678849">Now, I don't think from the point of view of equity and just common justice, there can be no question but that there should be equitable apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.151" offset="731930">For example, the recovery in the third-party of, let's say, $10,000, and the lien is $3,000; therefore, $7,000, or 70 percent of the recovery, inures to the benefit of the longshoreman, and $3,000, or 30 percent of the recovery, inures to the benefit of the compensation insurance carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.357" offset="996812">What is happening here is the stevedore, or the employer, is receiving back payments that it initially made out.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.499" offset="1109347">The stevedore here is recovering money, and there is no reason from an equitable point of view why he should not pay reasonable attorneys' fees for making that recovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="851.564" offset="3509582">And the courts have always ruled on it whenever necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.150" offset="3527973">Equitably, before the 1972 amendment, there were cases such as Russo and Ballwanz, which are cited in the brief, which did not allow equitable apportionment of the attorney's fees between the stevedore and the longshoreman on the theory that when you had the third-party case allowed under the Ryan decision, the stevedore was ultimately paying the longshoreman judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.600" offset="3653778">So it would be inequitable for the stevedore, in effect, to have to pay twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.809" offset="3674572">He's paying the judgment, and in addition to that, he's paying fees on what he recoups to the attorney who sues him.</text>

            <text syncTime="901.559" offset="3709576">And so it was disallowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.119" offset="3715845">However, when the '72 amendments came in, and the stevedore is now insulated from the third-party suit, he cannot be sued, now the courts, Fourth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit to some degree, have overruled those prior decisions; and now, because the equity favors the longshoreman, have allowed the recovery of the lien.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.885" offset="7594924">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.453" offset="7613210">We contend that the stevedore should be allowed to recoup its entire lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.555" offset="7641631">And the statute, the legislative history, and the construction by this Court since the 1972 amendments were passed all point in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.446" offset="7697115">The statute that has been mentioned in various questions brought up by the Court is a remedial one, and it is the result of political forces in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.407" offset="7744972">The employers resisted for quite some time an increase in benefits under the statute, and the benefits were quite low up until 1972 because they were being hit both ways up until that time by virtue of the Seas Shipping and the Ryan decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.780" offset="7830444">So that the employer usually wound up as a third party paying both compensation and being hit with a judgment or settlement for liability, after having been in pleaded by the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.636" offset="7893870">As a result of negotiation in the legislative process, the longshoring companies, the stevedoring companies, agreed to an increase in benefits, but as price for that increase, they were to be insulated from being impleaded in these third-party actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.775" offset="7998464">And--but because of the power of the longshoremen's union, Congress saw fit as part of the compromise package to allow the stevedores, the longshoremen-employees, to bring third-party actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.608" offset="8085817">But when you look at the legislative history, and you look at the provisions of the statute itself, it is quite clear that it is intended to be a compensation statute, and the third party recovery aspect of it is given a lesser degree of attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.154" offset="8191979">The--for one thing, as I mentioned, the benefits are quite high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.840" offset="8206712">They are 200 percent of the average national weekly wage, and they are computed annually in order to adjust for inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.885" offset="8258957">Whenever an attorney is involved in the compensation portion of securing payment, the Deputy Commissioner of Labor is empowered to oversee any fees that are awarded to the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.002" offset="8331368">And it is usually only in the case of a contest over the amount of compensation, and that the employer turns out to be wrong in resisting, that an attorney is awarded a fee; and only on the excess that he brings to his client as a result of that contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.996" offset="8423320">And in all cases, the Deputy Commissioner is empowered to look at the fees awarded to attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.887" offset="8458951">All of this seems, to my mind, manifestly intended to preserve the employer's assets for the payment of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.178" offset="8512136">And, as has been pointed out, the statute itself lays out a very specific formula for if the employer wishes to recoup his compensation lien, encouraging him to do so, awarding him not only the fee, but his expenses, his attorneys' fees, and a portion of any excess over this amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.842" offset="8638777">The -- I would also like to address myself to the equity of this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.594" offset="8681723">It is argued that equity would not -- does not permit the recovery of a fund without rewarding the person who is responsible for securing that fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.748" offset="8738356">But it seems to me applying it to this kind of situation, it is -- you have to go one step deeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.732" offset="8766255">Namely, that the attorney did not create the fund, the fund that consists of the compensation lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.565" offset="8805648">The compensation lien is there by virtue of the fact that compensation has been paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2892.939" offset="11675146">And we do not argue that the Court--that by affirming the Second Circuit here today that the Court would establish a rigid rule that there would still be room under the cases for a court to fashion an allocation where there was not a sufficient third party recovery to satisfy both the lien and the attorney's fee out of the recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.345" offset="11804714">And that was considered in the--some of the cases that were cited pre-'72 law was that, yes, when there wasn't enough, that there could be a solution worked out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.995" offset="11931355">Pre-'72, there--at a certain point, until there was--the stevedore's lien came first out of the recovery, and then the attorney's fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.311" offset="12000632">After--there are some cases--after 1972, which reversed the process, the attorney's fee is paid, then the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.665" offset="12054026">And we contend that that is a sufficient accommodation to the 1972 amendments, and this Court doesn't need to go further in further readjusting, because of the change in situation wrought by the 1972 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.928" offset="12131035">And it doesn't have to go to the extent of pro rata allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.833" offset="12166666">And also, we contend that it would be a burden for the courts and for the employer, in each case, to have to have a hearing as suggested by the Court in Mitchell, I believe the Fifth Circuit case; because that again would draw the stevedore-employer into court unnecessarily, requiring him to employ a lawyer to defend his right to the lien recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.102" offset="12339806">And we contend that it should be an automatic rule which would -- which if this Court affirms the Second Circuit, would mean that the employer would, in every case where there is sufficient funds available, pay the attorney's fee and the lien, that that would mean that the stevedore-employer would automatically, without a hearing, without law, recoup the entire workmen's compensation lien.</text>
