            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">And the Forsham case is a Companion case to the Kissinger case arising out of a nationwide group of private physicians, 00:11 scientists specializing in the treatment of diabetes forming a group program to conduct a long term study of the effectiveness of different methods for treating diabetes.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.696" offset="106684">Over the years, this study has received approximately $15 million in federal grant funding from the department of HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.255" offset="149002">It has generated more than $55 million records documenting the treatment of more than 1000 diabetic patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.446" offset="181708">In the last decade, this group has published findings based on this data indicating that certain known methods for treating adult diabetes increase the patient's risk there from cardiovascular disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.061" offset="240222">These findings have generated its substantial professional debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.397" offset="261538">Another group of physicians involved in the treatment of diabetic patients calling themselves as The Committee and Care of the Diabetic known as the CCD have been among those critical of this first group's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.872" offset="323396">The CCD determined that it was necessary to gain access to the university group data in order to effectively scrutinize these studies findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.652" offset="366550">Physicians who are members of CCD -- petitioners in this Court sought to obtain access to the data by filing an FOIA request with the department of HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.234" offset="416914">HEW denied the request for the data on the grounds that the only required disclosure of agency records was the records generated by the university group and that these were not agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.939" offset="499670">The CCD for Physicians then filed this FOIA suite in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking an order requiring HEW to make all of the raw data complied by the university group available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.625" offset="570410">The District Court and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld HEW's determination that the data sought were not discoverable under FIOA.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.305" offset="617117">Today, we affirmed the judgement of the Court of Appeals and enacting the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.143" offset="640522">Congress granted a public a right of access to agency records, the data which the petitioners requested have been apprehended solely by the efforts of a privately controlled organization which has it all times required possession -- retain possession of the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.690" offset="714710">We hold that when federal agency has neither created nor obtained records generated by private organization, those records are not agency records and therefore, are not available pursuant to request under Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.944" offset="783673">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
