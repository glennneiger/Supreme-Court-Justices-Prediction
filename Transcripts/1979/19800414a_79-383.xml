            <text syncTime="108.217" offset="536221">In this case Mr. Standefer was indicted on a 9-count indictment, the odd counts of which charged him with violation of 26 U.S.C. 7214(a)(2), the event counts of which charged 18 U.S.C. 201(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="126.837" offset="610722">Having read the 72-page opinion, majority and minority opinions of the court en banc and the three-judge panel, the Circuit Court withdrew their original opinion when they did order a hearing before the court en bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.382" offset="672893">But in reviewing that and in reviewing the briefs in this case, it sort of reminds me a little bit of the Alice-in-Wonderland story when Alice says to the big rabbit, "Where do I start?"</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="183.156" offset="836002">Well, Mr. Gondelman, after having read your 113-page brief on petition for writ of certiorari, I notice that nowhere do you cite Dunn v. The United States, which is Justice Holmes' old opinion saying that inconsistent verdicts in juries are perfectly permissible under the Constitution and the Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.229" offset="944253">Do you think you can win this case without overruling the Dunn case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold Gondelman</label>
            <text syncTime="214.391" offset="960972">I think so, Your Honor, and I will address myself directly to that, because in order to start in this case you must start by leading the indictment against Mr. Standefer and, unfortunately, no court has yet got to the indictment that I thought I was trying.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.851" offset="1026800">Let me show Your Honor why I think and did not discuss Justice Holmes' case, because it has nothing to do with this case, if I may say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.079" offset="1059715">The indictment in this case says that Mr. Standefer did on or about -- and I won't go through all the odd counts, but each start with a date -- did aid and abet Cyril J. Niederberger, an officer and employee of the United States, acting in connection with Revenue laws of the United States, namely a supervisory Internal Revenue agent -- skipping dates -- in unlawfully and knowingly receiving a fee, compensation and reward as set forth below which was not prescribed by law for the performance of his duties as an Internal Revenue Service agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.217" offset="1208195">Now, when I read that indictment I then to make certain that all courts would be able to correlate very clearly what I am talking about, in my motion to dismiss I attached the Count 1 indictment against Standefer with the Count 2 indictment against Niederberger so that we could see exactly what the same party -- that is the United States of America -- under its grand jury charged Mr. Niederberger with as well as Mr. Standefer with.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.744" offset="1330343">And at pages 28-A on, you will see that the grand jury indictment against Mr. Niederberger says that from on or about the same dates that Standefer is charged with having given the fee, compensation and reward to an officer employee Niederberger -- and no one else, Niederberger -- that Mr. Niederberger did receive the golf trip in the exact amount on the exact date to the same place at the same time.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="334.359" offset="1440789">Well, what if Mr. Niederberger had dropped dead even before he was indicted do you think that would preclude indictment and conviction of Standefer?</text>

            <text syncTime="346.081" offset="1487705">Mr. Chief Justice, we are long past the need to try the principal or convict the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.081" offset="1515708">But when the Government of the United States chooses to indict the principal, and they are supposed to know the law, and in order to have some kind of semblance of uniformity across this country of ours, because each U.S. Attorney may act differently and does, if Niederberger was not tried there would not be a mutual collateral estoppel, there would not be a finding by a jury that he did not in fact commit the crime, and that is what happened here.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.233" offset="1792293">There are cases in the Supreme Court of the United States where if you try two conspirators and only two conspirators and one is found not guilty, there can be no conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.111" offset="1831790">So you really have to get to the nub of whether or not I can also win this case because I think the charge is incorrect, and that is raised on this appeal, and that the judge below in his charge said you don't have to find an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.289" offset="1884557">Now, that is why I would like to get back to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.157" offset="1891976">What does the indictment say?</text>
            <text syncTime="450.054" offset="1903574">Standefer cannot be indicted, as we all know, under 7214(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="453.658" offset="1917994">It only applies to an employee of the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.257" offset="1932413">He can only be indicted as an aider and abettor.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.201" offset="1944221">Now, if we want to look at definitions we have to look at Black's law dictionary which says that aiding and abetting, as cited on page 15 of my brief, implies knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.541" offset="1993540">It comprehends all assistance rendered by words, acts and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.978" offset="2015274">It is not sufficient that there is a mere negative acquiescence not in any way made known to the principal malefactor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1932.015" offset="7831385">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.457" offset="7857194">The basic issue in this case is whether one who aids, abets, counsels, induces, commands or procures an offense against the United States may be convicted for doing so after the actual perpretator of the offense is acquitted in a prior suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.258" offset="7932426">In the present case the evidence clearly showed and the jury found that petitioner as head of Gulf Oil Corporation's tax division and acting on Gulf's behalf gave five, authorized five all-expense-paid vacations to the Internal Revenue Service official in charge of the ongoing audits of Gulf's income tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.876" offset="8038902">Although petitioner claimed at trial that these gifts were made out of friendship and for social reasons, the jury found to the contrary, that they had been made and received as fees, compensations and rewards for the performance of the IRS official's duty and that, accordingly, the official violated 26 U.S.C. 7214 in accepting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.590" offset="8129703">In turn, the jury convicted petitioner of the five counts of aiding and abetting the IRS official and the unlawful receipt of those five vacations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.034" offset="8175470">There was one count for each vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.748" offset="8190412">Petitioner challenges three of those counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.728" offset="8206294">Petitioner does not deny the sufficiency of the evidence against him or assert any constitutional affirmity in his convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.509" offset="8241403">Rather, his basic claim in this case rests entirely on the fact that in a prior trial the IRS official was acquitted of the charges that he violated Section 7214 in accepting those three vacations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.492" offset="8305351">Although I might add that on two of those three vacations he was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. 201(g), part of the gratuities statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.569" offset="8349654">In turn, petitioner contends that those acquittals on the 7214 counts absolves him of any having aided and abetted the unlawful acceptance of those three vacations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.063" offset="8411617">In support of this position we construe petitioner to advance two basic arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.960" offset="8435231">One, 18 U.S.C. does not authorize the prosecution of the aider and abetter after the actual perpetrator has been acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.291" offset="8476505">And, two, even if 18 U.S.C. 2 -- that is the general aiding and abetting statute -- does authorize such prosecution, then under the doctrine of nonmutual collateral estoppel the prior acquittal of Niederberger, the IRS agent, bars petitioner's conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.866" offset="8858833">Petitioner's first argument based on the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 2 is that when Congress enacted the statute in 1909, Congress intended to carry forward an aspect of the common law under which the prior acquittal of the common law principle precluded conviction of the common law accessory before the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.207" offset="9936227">Well, we distinguish all those in our brief but let me take -- I can give you one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.834" offset="9954722">Morrison is perhaps a good example of the infirmity in that reasoning with respect to each of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.968" offset="9983248">In the Morrison case there were two people who allegedly conspired and the Court held that evidence with respect to one of them was based upon an unconstitutional presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.388" offset="10036955">And then the Court looked at the rest of the evidence and said, but there is absolutely nothing else in this record that would support a finding that Conspirator No. 1 had entered into any agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.562" offset="10089618">Therefore, because there was an absolute failure of any proof with respect to the agreement element, the conviction was invalid with respect to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.146" offset="10123995">That case does not hold that where there is sufficient evidence with respect to each element of the conspiracy that the jury couldn't return inconsistent verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.531" offset="10165478">And I think you could go down each of those cases that the petitioner has cited on that point and everyone of them can be reconciled with our point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.074" offset="10231620">Turning back to the question of statutory intent with respect to 18 U.S.C. 2, perhaps I should briefly say that the reason that this statute was enacted in the first place involves a perverse rule under the common law that originally came into the common law at a time that the death penalty was a common penalty for felonies and it was felt there was some procedural protection that was needed to protect against the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.265" offset="10372472">The rule worked only with respect to a term known only to the common law and that was accessories before the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.681" offset="10406118">Just to contrast it, the rule even at common law with respect to misdemeanors was that everyone who was in any way directly or indirectly responsible for a crime was a principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.013" offset="10451466">There was no such thing as an accessory before the fact for misdemeanors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.303" offset="10472573">Moreover, a person who aided and abetted and was present at a crime, that is a felony at common law, also could be charged and convicted irrespective of whether or not any other person was convicted of a crime and that person was regarded as a principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.179" offset="10544044">Now, the special rule that applies with respect to accessories before fact was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.629" offset="10561912">An accessory before the fact was someone who was not present at the scene of a crime but who aided or somehow counseled and assisted in the commission of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.784" offset="10606529">That person could not be even prosecuted until the principal was convicted or unless they were charged in the same joint trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.439" offset="10649161">And that was part of this procedural safeguard against the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.684" offset="10670059">This had some unfortunate results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.479" offset="10681240">For example, if a principal just couldn't be found, then the accessory before the fact even if they were in custody could not be brought to justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.601" offset="10717811">Similarly, if the principal were to die, then the principal could never be convicted and therefore they couldn't be accessory before the fact, could not be brought to justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.347" offset="10760756">And, more to the point of this case, if the principal were tried and acquitted, that acquittal would forever thereafter bar the conviction of the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.363" offset="10804851">And therefore the procedural bar rule couldn't be satisfied and the accessory before the fact thereafter could not be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.228" offset="10836302">Now, with the waning of the death penalty, most of the States eventually abolished that distinction altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.495" offset="10861380">And Congress in 1909 did exactly that in 18 U.S.C. 2 which provided that anyone who aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced or procured an offense against the United States is a principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.119" offset="10931806">Now, by defining principal to include all aiders and abetters, etc., the statute just simply abolished the category of accessories before the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.091" offset="10975692">And since this category is the very predicate of the petitioner's argument, the 1909 Act also abolished the predicate for the petitioner's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.209" offset="11028250">Under the Act petitioner is not an accessory before the fact and is not entitled to any special pleading rules but is punishable to the same extent as the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.072" offset="11091675">Turning to the second of the petitioner's arguments, this is an independent argument and as Justice White has pointed out, it is much broader than the statutory argument based on 18 U.S.C. 2. Petitioner as did Judge Gibbons below, argues that the conviction of petitioner with respect to the aiding and abetting counts, as to those three counts, is barred by the doctrine of nonmutual collateral estoppel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.885" offset="13330892">Our point is that we don't feel that way when there is overwhelming proof of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.309" offset="13352626">To us the logical inference, as this Court has recognized from time to time, is that juries do exercise compassion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.873" offset="13374882">Now, you are right, in the Ashe case the Court said we are not going to concern ourselves with the fact that there might be compassion, in that passage where the Court talks about we will assume the rational verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.559" offset="13417618">But that is because the Court was dealing with double jeopardy and in order to safeguard the constitutional right against excessive prosecutions the Court rightly decided we will not indulge or recognize the fact that juries indulge in compassion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.226" offset="13484283">We are not dealing with double jeopardy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.291" offset="13492537">This is solely a judge-made rule of prudential considerations as to whether or not nonmutual collateral estoppel ought to be applied to criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.210" offset="13536214">And just as the judge made rule concerning inconsistent verdicts, takes that factor into account, the compassion factor, so it should be taken into account here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.962" offset="13587205">Another reason why civil cases are different is because in criminal cases the United States does not have the same full and fair opportunity for factual determinations that are available in civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.546" offset="13657527">The rule of this problem is the so-called jury nullification which, again, the Court has recognized that that goes on in the jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.312" offset="13696606">But it begins even before that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.937" offset="13703084">There is no discovery in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.318" offset="13712593">There are privileges that prohibit the Government from taking the depositions of the principals to the primary transactions at issue in a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.663" offset="13754075">There is no directed verdict that the Government can ask for when the weight of the evidence is overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.317" offset="13776645">There is no summary judgment motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.906" offset="13786990">And when the jury does exercise compassion, we can't go and ask for a judgment NOV and say set aside that jury verdict or ask for a new trial because the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.467" offset="13833279">Nor can we even appeal the jury's factual determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.509" offset="13849370">And the Sanabria case, in fact this Court said "No matter how egregious the error may be the Government just has no recourse against that."</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.127" offset="13883852">Now, that is a big difference between the criminal case and the civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.694" offset="13902137">And in the criminal case the Government typically does not have the same full and fair opportunity that is available in civil cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.627" offset="13993880">But it could nevertheless prove guilt of the second defendant, which makes the two cases quite different in a criminal count.</text>

            <text syncTime="3479.964" offset="14023241">We intended to argue it and I think we had a long footnote in which we refer to Fourth Amendment problem that you just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.096" offset="14059708">And that would mean that, for example, in case No. 1 certain evidence that is crucial might be excluded but it would be available to be used in case No. 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.193" offset="14100146">And that once again is part of the problem that the Government faces in having the same full and fair opportunity to litigate an issue that is available in civil cases, because in civil cases these exclusionary rules just aren't problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.886" offset="14158869">But they are big problems in criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.811" offset="14186663">Now, it is Footnote 29, Mr. Justice Stevens, in our brief is where we refer to that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.238" offset="14252283">I see my time is running out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.602" offset="14261791">I would just say briefly that there are other reasons why nonmutual collateral estoppel ought not to be applied in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.776" offset="14294497">Briefly, one is that the inquiry into determining whether or not the Government had had a full and fair opportunity and exactly what issue was previously decided might be an exhaustive inquiry in cases and given the fact that it is the United States -- this is really the only one who has an interest here -- the United States often takes into account the outcomes of prior trials and is not like an ordinary civil litigant and may not repeat litigation except where in the interest of justice we think it is necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3583.257" offset="14436394">Going back to the example -- the type of examples in your Footnote 29, why isn't that problem adequately handled by in the second trial the Government simply advising the trial court that there were these valid objections to its case and therefore the rule shouldn't apply in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.164" offset="14503999">Why is that a reason for not applying the rule?</text>

            <text syncTime="3602.860" offset="14514761">Well, theoretically you could make an inquiry into exactly what evidence was excluded at the first trial, what evidence wasn't even offered because they knew it would be subject to constitutional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.794" offset="14582575">For example, in this case, in the Niederberger case we couldn't even call Standefer as a witness in the first case and we didn't even try because we knew he would invoke his -- so there wasn't any exclusion per se but it was just not done because of --But you are right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.887" offset="14642970">Those factors could all be listed, the judge at the second trial could try to take all those into account and then the judge could turn to the issue of what was actually decided by the first jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.936" offset="14687065">Our point is that that would be a very exhaustive inquiry in each case and most of the time the judge is going to find there wasn't a full and fair opportunity and it is just not worth the candle to make that inquiry in so many cases where it would undoubtedly be raised repeatedly, simply in the very small number of cases to be able to invoke the doctrine of nonmutual collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.806" offset="14790614">If the whole point, or if one of the major points is to save time of the courts, we think this would waste time of the courts, not actually save it.</text>
