            <text syncTime="224.708" offset="1002245">In any event, when it went back to State habeas proceedings, the two lawyers who represented the three defendants testified along with the trial judge, the defendant, one of the co-defendants as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.769" offset="1050415">As the testimony developed, it appeared that each of the defendants selected at his option one of the two lawyers to be lead counsel; the other to be backup counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.719" offset="1086255">Sullivan selected one lawyer, Judge DiBona, who unfortunately died about two weeks ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.395" offset="1108929">The other two defendants selected the other attorney as their lead counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.776" offset="1130454">Mr. DiBona testified at the post-conviction hearing, which is our State habeas proceeding, that there was, as far as he was concerned, no conflict of interest in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.832" offset="1166712">All the decisions he made were based on the best interests of his client Sullivan; and that he perceived no problems in any of his representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.360" offset="1204851">Now, the key to this case, and the key that troubled the Third Circuit was, Mr. Peruto, when he testified, indicated in one small part of his testimony that he had some regrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.758" offset="1246438">He felt that perhaps he may have advised Sullivan to hold back on presenting his defense, because he thought the case was won.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.551" offset="1281546">He thought Sullivan had the case won, because the Commonwealth did not present sufficient evidence to convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.863" offset="1298787">And therefore, why put on the defense when you could save it for the other two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.911" offset="1319058">Now, as I say Judge DiBona indicated that he had absolutely no basis or motivation for his decision not to put on a defense; it had nothing to do with the decision at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.218" offset="1352286">In any event, when the case got to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on the conflict issue, that Court ruled that there was no true dual representation in the true sense, because of the lead counsel situation, and the backup counsel situation; and found under the circumstances that there was no conflict on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.531" offset="1417488">The District Court essentially upheld that ruling, finding, in its conclusion -- crediting Judge DiBona's testimony as to what motivated him as to why he did what he did.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="338.334" offset="1456671">Well, if they believed Judge DiBona, they didn't have much alternative about the decision, did they?</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text syncTime="345.298" offset="1484570">The Third Circuit, however, the panel, when they got the case, held that the legal conclusion that there was no dual representation was erroneous; that there was a clear indication on the record that there was dual representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.745" offset="1538382">And there were indices that Peruto did participate in the defense of Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.460" offset="1553220">There's no question about that, and we don't dispute that.He was present; he was at counsel table; and did aid in the defense of Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.993" offset="1583313">The key to the case is the standard employed in the Third Circuit for view of conflict problems, and that is, the possibility of conflict, however remote --</text>

            <text syncTime="380.391" offset="1624900">Well, Mr. Goldblatt, before you get to that, in your question three, on your petition for certiorari, you raise the -- whether the Federal court failed to give proper deference to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's determination on a factual issue; that is, whether there was a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.529" offset="1705462">Now, are you arguing now that dual representation is or is not a mixed question of fact or law, a question of law, a question of fact, and whether conflict of interest is a question of fact if not dual representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.178" offset="1776097">What I am saying -- argument three, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe goes to the question, assuming the Third Circuit panel is correct in their conclusion -- two conclusions, one that there is evidence of dual representation on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.428" offset="1817057">And I would concede, that is a legal conclusion from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.033" offset="1827506">It's not a factual conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.948" offset="1835133">And if they're also correct that the standard, possibility of conflict, however remote, is an appropriate standard of review, even in that event this case would have to be remanded to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.304" offset="1876616">Because the Third Circuit, in rejecting the District Court and State court, made its own findings of fact, based on a record that is totally disputed in every way and every step of the way up.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.760" offset="1918412">In other words, it's not a situation where they're adopting District Court findings or State court findings; nobody has made relevant findings under their theory of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.203" offset="2256227">Ironically, one of the reasons they found ineffective assistance was because the case had not been argued on direct appeal, and because the Court had split 3-3 on the issue of sufficiency of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.173" offset="2296038">So a new appeal was granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="927.024" offset="3811453">And Judge DiBona testified that once the decision was made by the defendant to not testify, there were no good witnesses to present.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.565" offset="3885641">The Third Circuit said, "No, that we will not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.256" offset="3896404">What you're asking us to do is to make an actual conflict determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="953.593" offset="3917720">All we're concerned with is the possibility, however remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.456" offset="3933184">"And what we submit is, the possibility, however remote, is not a standard of reversal; it's a standard of prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.588" offset="3957739">And this was noted in the Three Judge opinion, dissenting from the denial of reargument, that the effect of a possibility of conflict, however remote, standard, when applied the way it way in this case, is to literally bar joint representation within those courts that come into the circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.327" offset="4016671">Because the risk is so great that you're going to lose on collateral attack, if that's the only thing that the defendant has to show, that there's literally no point in risking joint representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.306" offset="7456580">Well, Ms. Gelb, we do have a cold record here, as the Third Circuit also did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.057" offset="7483643">And if you'll look at 9B of the Appendix to the petition for a writ of certiorari, which has a portion of the Third Circuit's opinion, they refer the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's findings -- it's the blue-they refer to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's language, "we therefore hold that there is absolutely no evidence that a conflict existed."</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.410" offset="7584998">That's the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.462" offset="7593253">Then the Third Circuit goes on to say, "Respondents urge that this conclusion is a finding of fact by a State after a full hearing which is entitled to a presumption of correctness and should be accepted by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.200" offset="7644139">Petitioner argues that we should reject it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.319" offset="7652603">The magistrate accepted petitioner's position, while the district judge accepted respondents'.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.080" offset="7687711">We believe both were mistaken in their approach to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.416" offset="7705057">"Now, what do you take the Third Circuit to mean by saying that?</text>

          <turn speaker="marilyn_j_gelb" startTime="1904.097" stopTime="2088.234">
            <label>Ms. Marilyn J. Gelb</label>
            <text syncTime="1904.097" offset="7719790">I take the Third Circuit to have examined the precise procedural history of this case, and to have concluded that the factual underpinnings supported this conclusion of law that there was, number one, dual representation, and number two, a conflict of interest, or at least a possibility for a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.575" offset="7801710">And if I might take a moment at this time, sir, to discuss the procedural history, because I fear that there be some cloud on that history, as it was rather tortuous when it proceeded through the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.086" offset="7855731">It appeared that after Sullivan was convicted, an appeal -- well, post-verdict motions were filed by both attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.232" offset="7900348">Thereafter the case rather sat for almost a year, during which time -- six months after the conviction of Sullivan -- Carchidi was tried and was acquitted, and DiPasquale was tried and was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.924" offset="7959071">Thereafter, post-verdict motions were argued for Sullivan by both counsel, and were denied 2-1 -- there was a court involving three judges--2-1, there was a denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.638" offset="8001912">Then, Mr. DiBona and Mr. Peruto appealed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.124" offset="8023855">And that's where the case sat for some -- well over three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.251" offset="8044335">Because the appeals were filed, if my recollection serves me correctly, in August of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.528" offset="8065442">And the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania never decided this case until December 29th of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.404" offset="8093027">It is entirely possible, and likely, I say, from the factual context, that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania did not decide the case for that very lengthy period of time because there was no argument by either counsel, Mr. DiBona having become a judge at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.896" offset="8170977">Mr. Peruto did not argue these capital cases before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Continuances, numerous ones, were requested during this lengthy period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.971" offset="8215280">And, as a matter of fact, there was a very strong controversy as to whether any brief was ever filed on behalf of Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.937" offset="8251120">The duties and obligations which were owed to Sullivan were simply dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.624" offset="8269824">They were simply abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.786" offset="8274526">And he was abandoned in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, as he was to later argue, on post-conviction proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.127" offset="8303888">Now, that is the reason post-conviction proceedings were initiated some years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.215" offset="8324263">It was not because he sat on any rights he thought he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.329" offset="8340668">And it was not because he wanted merely to express some sort of lament later on that he wasn't acquitted, as were the two codefendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.094" offset="8379747">It was because that was filed most timely, the post-conviction proceedings followed by a short period of time the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and petition for reargument that was filed in the Supreme Court following the decision of the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.177" offset="12936129">And I would submit to the Court that there is no basis for concluding in 1967, where there is nothing on the record to indicate that the judge should have sensed the conflict problem, especially given separate trials, that there is nothing to find in the constitution to require that the judge should have done it then, or even now.</text>
