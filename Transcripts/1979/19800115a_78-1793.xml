            <text syncTime="5.391" offset="124949">Mr. Shapiro, you may proceed whenever you‘re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="14.647" offset="161938">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.877" offset="174895">After listening to extensive allocutions from defense counsel and the prosecutor, Judge Pratt imposed sentence on petitioner, explaining that he had considered the fact that petitioner was a dealer in heroin, that petitioner was on parole from a prior bank robbery conviction and that petitioner had refused to cooperate with the Government in identifying the persons who supplied them of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.891" offset="270921">We contend that Judge Pratt's consideration of petitioner's refusal to cooperate, along with his prior record and the severity of his offense, was entirely proper and was consistent with Congress' directive that no limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the character and the conduct of a person convicted of an offense, which maybe considered in imposing sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.541" offset="369560">Petitioner's contrary view is based on the argument that his refusal to cooperate was an exercise of Fifth Amendment rights and that Judge Pratt punished him for exercising those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.118" offset="423894">The short answer to that contention is that petitioner never claimed or asserted any Fifth Amendment right which he may have had.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.838" offset="454719">Throughout the three-year period that preceded his sentence, petitioner never suggested that his refusal to cooperate rested on Fifth Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.613" offset="489827">In addition, his conduct gave no indication that he was relying on the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.840" offset="510725">When he was first interviewed in 1975, he immediately confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.756" offset="530369">He later pleaded guilty, first, of the charge of conspiracy and later, to two of the substantive counts in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.996" offset="559313">Most importantly, at the time of the sentencing hearing, defense counsel fully disclosed petitioner's refusal to cooperate and did not even hint that the extent of this cooperation should not be considered or that this subject was immune from consideration under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.619" offset="629844">Far from invoking the Fifth Amendment, counsel stated to the Court that petitioner refused to cooperate because he wasn't that involved in the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.063" offset="667669">Counsel argued yesterday that everyone must have known that petitioner was relying on the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.163" offset="692015">With deference, the District Court would have needed powers of clairvoyance to recognize that there was a Fifth Amendment claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.818" offset="722631">The Fifth Amendment was not raised as a justification for petitioner's refusal to cooperate until he filed his brief in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.734" offset="758262">This Court has repeatedly held that the Fifth Amendment is not self-executing and may not be relied on unless it's invoked in timely fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.100" offset="799744">Petitioner's argument, that the Fifth Amendment protects his silence without any invocation of the Fifth Amendment in the District Court.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="180.505" offset="825344">Would your position here be different if he had in his allocution, asserted a Fifth Amendment right and not to reveal the sources of his drug supply?</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="193.918" stopTime="212.024">
            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="193.918" offset="879052">I believe that that would present a far different question and it would raise a serious constitutional difficulty if petitioner had invoked and relied on the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.515" offset="917400">That issue can be argued two different ways, but we submit that the Court need not to grapple with that difficulty in this case, where the Fifth Amendment was never exercised.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="212.024" stopTime="224.897">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="212.024" offset="951463">Well, how would -- just -- just -- how would you go about asserting of the Fifth Amendment? Would it be an assertion that would be retroactive to the time when he failed to cooperate?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="224.897" offset="1002977">He would simply, as the Second Circuit pointed out that the Vermeulen case, he would simply advise the sentencing court that he was relying on the Fifth Amendment and not cooperating and that this was an impermissible factor in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.767" offset="1054490">And had he done so, I had every confidence that the District Court would have taken that factor out of its consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.096" offset="1083747">It's a simple matter as Judge Moore pointed out in the Vermeulen case to apprise the Court of one's reliance on the Constitution at the sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.758" offset="1118438">A great deal of debate was focused on the question of cooperation and it would have been very simple for counsel to advise the Court that this was an improper consideration and that the Fifth -- Fifth Amendment privileged his refusal to cooperate.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="266.402" offset="1169011">But you're not entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment, unless there's a real and substantial probability that the answer to the question will in fact incriminate you.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="277.577" stopTime="279.365">
            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="277.577" offset="1213628">That's quite correct.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="279.365" offset="1220838">So that, I mean just a talismanic invocation of the Fifth Amendment would necessarily solve the problem even though you say that in -- apparently, it's conceded, that didn't take place here.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.315" offset="1276635">And Your Honor is quite correct in pointing out that if the District Court concluded that there was no realistic exposure to incrimination from this answer and that petitioner was simply covering up for other person which was our inference all along, that then it would be an invalid invocation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.629" offset="1345912">That's what this Court held in the Rogers case and another case that we cited in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.137" offset="1363884">I took -- took it from Mr. Palmer's argument yesterday that his chief reliance on this claim was because of -- of a fear of some possible consequences of disclosing who his principal sources of heroin were.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.035" offset="1439535">Had he brought that to the attention of the Court, it would've greatly altered the complexion of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.689" offset="1462105">But as this Court has held, it's not sufficient merely to refuse to answer a question or to fail to provide information.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.815" offset="1490631">That's not an invocation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.255" offset="1500348">And had he entertained the subjective beliefs, he should've advised the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.810" offset="1518634">The Court would have no way of knowing that he was fearful of self-incrimination under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.416" offset="1540995">There was no indication of this at all from counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.927" offset="1555101">And he had three years to -- to develop this theory, if we wish -- wished to advance it.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.690" offset="1574118">We notified him from the outset that the extent of this cooperation would affect the charges against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.308" offset="1596583">The amount of time he spent in prison and would be made known to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.916" offset="1611003">And yet he never invoked the Fifth Amendment until this theory occurred to him in the Court of Appeals, when he put this argument into his appellate brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.815" offset="1718627">Is -- is that -- is that a sort of de facto assertion of the Fifth Amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="411.133" offset="1747884">This Court held that it is not in the Piemonte case.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.081" offset="1759692">In Piemonte, the Court concluded that fear of retaliation and of -- and one's physical safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.278" offset="1784456">It's not the same as a fear of self-incrimination and that it's the duty of the Government to protect persons against retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.722" offset="1814235">And we do indeed have a system for doing that, the witness protection program.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.651" offset="1830013">If this had been explained to the Government or to the Court, steps could have been taken to protect petitioner if that was his concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.118" offset="1855822">But no one was ever advised of this factor as being a concern on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.663" offset="1877974">Other coconspirators in this conspiracy did assist the Government and did testify against persons who were higher up in the chain of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.740" offset="1914337">And there was no retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.507" offset="1921442">If petitioner had been fearful of this, he should've apprised the Court and the prosecutor, but this was never raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.870" offset="5374830">It was an opportunity to break off his prior pattern of behavior, an opportunity that he rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.311" offset="5400639">Petitioner's refusal to help make immense for the harm which he had done, was one of many invocations that he was a full prospect for rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.258" offset="5436374">As Professor Heart has correctly pointed out, rehabilitation requires recognition of the community's interests and the obligations of community life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.923" offset="5479111">Refusal to cooperate also suggested that the substantial period of imprisonment was needed to protect the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.510" offset="5505442">By refusing to cooperate, petitioner shows with his allegiance with his coconspirators was unbroken, an association that could be easily resumed on his release from prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.958" offset="5551208">Although petitioner at amici argued that noncooperation should not be considered, we submit that this -- the statute that the Chief Justice referred to, is direct evidence to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.224" offset="5596244">It says that there should be no limits on the information concerning the character and conduct of the person convicted of an offense, which may be considered in imposing sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.125" offset="5639920">This Court has approved that principle repeatedly in its own decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.416" offset="5657057">Most recently in the Grayson case, this Court emphasized that the sentencing judge should consider the whole range of information, bearing on a convicted defendant's character and his attitude towards society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.560" offset="5705644">Failure to cooperate with the authorities in stopping persons who continue to distribute heroin with in the community, is certainly relevant to the appraisal of the defendant's character and his attitude towards society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.982" offset="5755277">We note that at common law there was a duty to raise the “hue and cry” to alert the police to the occurrence of crimes by other persons, so those crimes could be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.593" offset="5789759">And under the modern Penal Code, it's a compounding, or misprision of felony not to report felonies and to conceal felonies by other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.804" offset="5830614">Petitioner's unwillingness to realign his interests with those of society and his determination to conceal the actions of those persons who prey on society, was a factor that the sentencing court could not properly ignore in making a responsible evaluation of his attitude and his character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.648" offset="5909922">Petitioner and amici have advanced the rather surprising argument that the extent of a defendant's cooperation is relevant in granting leniency, but is not relevant in enhancing punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.723" offset="5966242">We say that this is surprising because it presupposes two levels of punishment, based on the convicted defendant's willingness to cooperate and do name his accomplices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.430" offset="6005112">This theory would open the door to precisely the result that petitioner opposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.394" offset="6024965">Within statutory limits, consecutive sentences could be imposed on those persons who do not cooperate and concurrent sentences could be reserved for those who do and show their entitlement to leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.313" offset="6072613">This procedure, like the procedure that the petitioner opposes, would play substantial pressure on convicted defendants to name their accomplices to avoid additional prison time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.541" offset="6117543">We contend that there is no logical reason why defendant's refusal to cooperate should not be relevant in imposing sentence, whether the decision is characterized as increasing punishment or withholding lenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.401" offset="6168952">If the sentence is within statutory limits, if the defendant has had the opportunity to cooperate and if he's had the opportunity to plead any applicable constitutional privilege or present any mitigating information that he may possess to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.856" offset="6230810">And if he doesn't take any of these actions, his uncooperative conduct is properly judged at face value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.459" offset="6257246">Along with the other information available with the judge, it sheds light on the question whether the defendant is willing to recognize the obligations of community life and whether he continues to pose a threat to the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.483" offset="6377305">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.093" offset="6379708">Our -- our point is that -- that when the judge is considering these factors and petitioner's counsel is adverting to them before the Court, he has a duty to at least advise the Court that this is an impermissible factor, because of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.935" offset="6427146">A counsel is there for that very purpose to raise a constitutional or any other legal objections to these considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.660" offset="6457971">As the Court reaffirmed in the case of Dorszynski versus United States and I quote, "If there is one rule in the federal criminal practice which is firmly established, it is that the appellate court has no control over a sentence which is within the limits allowed by statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.245" offset="6528397">This Court has applied that rule in narcotics cases where substantial consecutive sentences were imposed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.359" offset="6556818">The Gore case and the Blockburger cases are examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.989" offset="6571342">The sentence imposed by Judge Pratt, fell squarely within the limits prescribed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.075" offset="6595688">Limits that Congress contemplated would provide maximum flexibility to the judge permitting him to tailor the period of imprisonment, as well as the fine under circumstances of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.367" offset="6644799">From a common sense point of view, the sentence imposed within these limits was not a severe or disproportionate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.666" offset="6674056">Judge Pratt required petitioner to serve only two years, before becoming eligible for parole and he declined to impose any fine of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.584" offset="6709687">For convicted heroin dealer, who was already on parole for a prior conviction for bank robbery, this we submit was a very lenient sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.610" offset="6745840">In our view, there is nothing here that would tempt an appellate tribunal to disturb the sentence imposed by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.553" offset="6777605">For these reasons, we respectfully request that the decision of the court below be affirmed.</text>
