            <label>Mr. Julian N. Eule</label>
            <text syncTime="12.241" offset="152325">Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.245" offset="164342">This case should never have come before the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.749" offset="182418">At its inception, it involved no more than a state common-law malpractice action commenced in a state court involving two private parties, an attorney and his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.644" offset="233932">Because, however, the attorney received compensation for his services under the Criminal Justice Act, the Pennsylvania State Courts concluded that federal common law afforded him absolute immunity from such a state cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.930" offset="295058">It is Petitioner's contention that this erroneous invocation of federal law is all that has necessitated review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.978" offset="327241">Two obviously related and often intertwined questions are presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.026" offset="351483">First, does federal common law have any rightful place in a state law action for malpractice commenced by an individual against a private attorney in a state court who was appointed to represent him in a federal criminal proceedings under the Criminal Justice Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="78.672" offset="418043">Second, if, in fact, Federal Common Law is applicable, what is the nature of that Federal Common Law?</text>
            <text syncTime="85.115" offset="443852">Is the immunity that this Court has afforded to judges and prosecutors equally applicable to the office of Court-appointed counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="95.737" offset="486275">Francis Rick Ferri, Petitioner herein, was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury sitting in the Western District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.792" offset="534549">He was charged with violation of both the United States Criminal Code and the Internal Revenue Code but because he was an indigent, counsel was appointed to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.461" offset="577181">Mr. Daniel Ackerman, the Respondent herein, was appointed to represent Mr. Ferri in this criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.445" offset="613125">Although the three-year statute of limitations on the Internal Revenue Code counts had run by the time the indictment was filed, Mr. Ackerman at no time moved to dismiss the indictment nor in any other way raised the statute of limitations defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.039" offset="679476">Mr. Ferri was convicted and sentenced to 20 years on the counts under the Criminal Code and 10 years to run consecutive to the Criminal Code counts on the Internal Revenue Code counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.489" offset="737364">On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Mr. Ferri, who was by this time represented by new counsel, did raise the statute of limitations issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.220" offset="776234">The Third Circuit, in a judgment order, concluded that the Statute of Limitations had been waived by its failure to have been raised at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.799" offset="822523">It is this failure to raise the Statute of Limitations defense that constitutes the thrust of Mr. Ferri's present malpractice issue, malpractice common-law action that he instituted in the Pennsylvania courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.943" offset="887097">Pennsylvania courts dismissed the suit on the ground that Federal Common Law provided an absolute right of immunity against suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.979" offset="927326">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded first of all that they were required by this Court's decision in Howard versus Lyons to apply federal law to the question of potential liability here and second of all, that the Federal Common Law Rule of Immunity that has applied to judges, federal judges under Bradley versus Fisher and federal prosecutors under Yaselli versus Goff applied with equal force to court-appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.209" offset="1044250">Petitioner submits that they were wrong on both aspects of this case on their decision to invoke Federal Common Law and second, in their ascertaining what, in fact, that Federal Common Law was.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="251.120" offset="1107884">If we should agree with you on the first premise, that they were wrong in believing that Federal Common Law was applicable, I suppose the appropriate action on the part of this Court would then be to remand the case to the Pennsylvania courts for them to decide it under state law, would it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="271.529" offset="1189491">Yes, that is what the Petitioner seeks and I think that is what -- even if the Court decides the question on the second issue and concludes that there is Federal Common Law but that Federal Common Law does not afford immunity, I think that the question of state law and whether state law affords immunity will be open nevertheless.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.349" offset="6352750">We contend, however, not only that it should be a matter of state law but that, in fact, if federal law is found to be applicable, that that federal interest here would not be an interest in immunity but would be in accountability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.789" offset="6422549">In Butz, this Court indicated that an individual who seeks immunity from suit has the burden of proving that there is a need for such immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3562.343" offset="14352697">And one of the ills, of course, is the thought of trying a criminal action over again in a civil environment with a lay jury is something public policy again should not countenance.</text>
