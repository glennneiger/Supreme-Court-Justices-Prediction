            <text syncTime="44.167" offset="280012">The answer to that question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.529" offset="289520">There is no provision in the State of Maine under that situation as we had before the authorization in the award of attorney's fees however, we would say that this certainly does not place the Respondents necessarily in a different category from other persons in this country who are serving or seeking to obtain legal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.322" offset="380635">Also there is the pro bono aspect of legal work and finally, there is the Legal Aid Societies which have been in effect for several years in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.501" offset="1593344">However, it's the State's contention that Section 1988 would not apply to the violations in this case before the bar, before the banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.610" offset="1641827">This is predicated upon two main assertions.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.332" offset="1652694">The first is that the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act was based upon Fourteenth Amendment violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.415" offset="1684982">The second is predicated upon the lack of specific statutory authorization, as we believe was mandated by the Alyeska Pipeline decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.605" offset="1729808">Now, in Hutto v Finney, this Court awarded attorney's fees but they awarded attorney's fees pursuant to violations of both the Eighth and the Fourteenth Amendment, neither of which are at issue herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.594" offset="1777768">In Fitzpatrick we had a discrimination claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.292" offset="1792502">We do not have any discrimination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.780" offset="1814444">Since 1866, Congress has seen fit to enact over 50 statutes is provide for attorney's fees, but they have not done so regarding the Social Security Act, except in limited areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.834" offset="1862719">One of those areas was Section 406(b)(1) which, I believe was amended in 1966, 1968, and dealt with disability claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.714" offset="1910262">Had Congress seen fit to specifically authorize the award of attorney's fees for a good faith violation in computing of benefits, it is Petitioners' assertion that they surely would have done so, and made it more plain than is made in the ambiguous history of that Act as going through the record as well as through the debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.632" offset="1997928">Once more, the wording of the Act is, that in the discretion of the Court, if a party prevails on the Civil Rights 1983 among other Civil Rights claims, and if it is a proceeding or action to enforce a provision of Section 1983, attorney's fees would be proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.338" offset="2072743">Once again, this was not an action to enforce a provision of 1983, as Petitioners assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.693" offset="2098134">Respondents have argued that the plain meaning theory would prevent any research into the history of Section 1983 prior to the revised statutes of 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.652" offset="2145991">The State would counter this by saying that throughout concurring opinions and dissenting opinions in Chapman, we believe that the Court has already gone beyond the revised statutes of 1874 and recognized that delving into the history prior to 1874 is indeed necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.506" offset="2229373">There are other cases in which the Court has also gone into the background of 1983 before the revision of 1874 one of those cases was District of Columbia v Carter, the other was Examining Board v Otero de Flores.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.668" offset="2290082">The Respondents have not considered Section 1983 in light of the events and passions of the times in which it was enacted for this reason we believe that there are arguments that the "and laws" provision applies must be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.201" offset="2380152">Finally, the State, while reserving some time for rebuttal, would like to make brief mention of its third argument having to do with exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.622" offset="2425814">The State alleges that the State Court does not have authority to hear a Section 1983 claim in a State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.976" offset="2463326">This was brought to bear in the State Court of Maine we brought it forward for this Court for your disposition.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Edmond Mittel</label>
            <text syncTime="738.579" offset="3057664">I will.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.414" offset="3064978">The first of those major points is that over many years, this Court has given all of the Civil Rights Statutes a broad reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.067" offset="3103640">The second major point deals with the plain meaning of Section 1983 as it now reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.862" offset="3138853">To turn first to what this Court has done in the United States v Price and in Griffin v Breckenridge, it said quite clearly that all of the Reconstruction Civil Rights Statutes were to be read broadly and literally and following that instruction, this Court has over the last 12 years reached a number of decisions in Section 1983, Social Security Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.281" offset="3272495">And in each of those cases, there was before this Court a claim for relief which had to turn on Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.913" offset="3318993">Two of those cases bear particular note.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.583" offset="3333726">The first is Rosado v Wyman; and the second is Edelman v Jordan.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.641" offset="3361938">Now Rosado is important because by the time that case came to this Court, there was no constitutional claim of any kind remaining in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.458" offset="3409168">In fact, the constitutional claim had dropped out several years previously in the District Court and in fact, even prior to a remand, if that is the proper word, from the three-judge court to Judge Weinstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.017" offset="3475414">This Court reached and decided the statutory claim; and the only possible cause of action that the Plaintiff in that case could have asserted was based on Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.426" offset="3537063">What had been done in Rosado was later specifically recognized and accepted in Zaelman; now be it in dicta, Edelman was of course about retroactive benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.966" offset="3591189">But in the course of that opinion, both the majority and one of the dissenting opinions specifically recognize what had happened in Rosado and specifically stated that the cause of action that was before this Court was the statutory 1983 cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.770" offset="3690454">The second point is that, as our brief points out, this is a case for the application of the traditional primary rule of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.809" offset="3742595">One looks to the plain meaning of the statute and applies it unless there is some very clear and convincing reason initially on the face of the statute to not do so and in this case, looking at this statute, there is no ambiguity on its face of any kind that permits the insertion of modifying or limiting words.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.980" offset="3851264">I should point out here that there are, of course, a range of cases involving federal statutes where Section 1983 actions cannot be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.259" offset="3896404">First and foremost, there must be defendants who are acting under color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.011" offset="3927437">Second Congress can, either expressly or impliedly, preclude federal courts from entertaining Section 1983 statutory causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.054" offset="3983548">We discuss that point in some more detail in footnote 12 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.708" offset="4006222">But once those two major exceptions fall by the wayside, we are then left with a very clear, very plain, very unambiguous statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="995.435" offset="4085112">Even if you are correct that 1983 embraces claims of violations of the Social Security Act, and even if you are correct that such claims under 1983 can be brought in state courts which have concurrent jurisdiction, there still remains the question, does there not, of whether or not Section 1988, which was enacted in response to the Alyeska opinion in this Court which had to do only with the practice of federal courts in awarding attorney's fees, is applicable at all to attorney's fees in state courts.</text>
