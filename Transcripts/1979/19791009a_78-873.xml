            <text syncTime="49.163" offset="300074">My name is Joseph Bruno, and I am Assistant Corporation Counsel of the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.974" offset="315225">I represent the petitioner, the Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.931" offset="335078">This case presents this Court the issue of the proper test of discrimination under a federal grant statute known as the Emergency School Aid Act as well as the proper test of discrimination under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as well as interrelationship between ESAA and Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.209" offset="412191">It is the position of HEW and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that the test of discrimination under both ESAA and Title VI is a disparate impact test.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.392" offset="452942">The Board's position is that under ESAA and Title VI, the test of discrimination is a constitutional intent test.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.292" offset="484498">A bit about the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.175" offset="492022">The ESAA statute sets up a competition in this country among school districts who seek to apply for a limited pool of ESAA funds of approximately $1.5 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.658" offset="537997">Proposals are submitted to HEW for grading on programmatic merits and a program would be funded if it came within the range of programmatic merits except if it was found to be ineligible under the provisions of section 1605(d)(1) of the ESAA statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.344" offset="616782">Suffice to say that the Board of Education submitted a proposal, was found to have sufficient programmatic merit, was denied funding under section 1605(d)(1)(B) when HEW found that certain of the New York City high schools were racially identifiable based upon staff assignments.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.916" offset="691075">Counsel, is 1605(d)(1)(B), the statute you question, does that involve the proposal submitted for funds or does it involve the practice, the existing practices of the school board submitting them?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph F. Bruno</label>
            <text syncTime="169.177" offset="780100">It involves the existing practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.794" offset="786578">It was a basis for finding ineligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.299" offset="796609">That is the ineligibility section of the ESAA statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.645" offset="813955">It does not relate to the individual proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.149" offset="823986">The proposals are apart from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.088" offset="827747">This is a basis upon ineligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.103" offset="835793">It talks about current practices or activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.130" offset="851884">The finding of ineligibility was based essentially on a statistical report done by HEW in relation to a 1976 OCR non-compliance letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.819" offset="902666">The validity of that determination of ineligibility was the subject of at least two reviews at HEW, was conceded by the District Court for the Eastern District of New York before Judge Jack B. Weinstein, and appealed to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.222" offset="960240">Now, the circuit held that ESAA itself requires application of an impact test in determining eligibility for funding on the issue of staff assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.738" offset="998275">The Court of Appeals also held that Title VI incorporates an impact test and therefore that the staff assignment policy of the Board also violated Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.917" offset="1035055">Let me deal first with the ESAA statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.496" offset="1045400">The subdivision I have indicated is section 1605(d)(1)(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="239.435" offset="1061073">It states "No educational agency shall be eligible for assistance under this chapter if it has as of June 23, 1972, it has had or maintained in effect any other practice, policy, or procedure which results in district apportion the demotion or dismissal of instructional or other staff, minority staff in conjunction with a desegregation plan" --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="262.572" offset="1153651">How do you get away from the language "which results"?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_f_bruno" startTime="267.618" stopTime="444.026">
            <label>Mr. Joseph F. Bruno</label>
            <text syncTime="267.618" offset="1173817">We do not, and we concede with respect to demotions and dismissal--the issue in this case is assignment of staff -- with respect to demotions and dismissals, we concede that is a disparate impact test for a very clear rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.035" offset="1219480">With respect to the assignment of staff, however, the language is "otherwise engage in discrimination."</text>
            <text syncTime="284.407" offset="1241004">Based on race color and national origin in the assignment of staff which is the issue in this case we can see that the motion to dismissals to is in despaired impact test for a very clear rational and congress so stated, I will get to a virtue of it with respect to assignment of staff however the languages are otherwise in case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.455" offset="1317177">HEW contends that this language of the statute makes it obvious that the test applicable, which we concede is the disparate impact to the motion to dismissal, is the same test that should be applicable to the assignment of staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.481" offset="1365347">I would submit that the Congress used very different terms when it dealt with demotions and dismissals as opposed to assignment of staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.691" offset="1390111">I would also note that in this section 1605(d)(1) which is the entire ineligibility section here, five activities that render a board ineligible, within this section it uses discrimination twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.281" offset="1448521">It uses it in subdivision (d) which deals with avoidance of minority group participation in curricular or extracurricular activities so as to discriminate against them -- that is the other place that it is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.628" offset="1493870">HEW concedes that there that is an intent test.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.614" offset="1509857">We say that if Congress knew what it was talking about with subdivision (d) it certainly knew what it was talking about with respect to subdivision (b) dealing with staff assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.991" offset="1555310">HEW could do nothing with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.434" offset="1565132">I would note that the real issue in this case is what did Congress intend when it used the word "discrimination."</text>
            <text syncTime="376.008" offset="1607450">HEW contends that the legislative history is extremely relevant, yet they totally ignore perhaps the most relevant legislative history in dealing with the meaning of the word "discrimination."</text>
            <text syncTime="386.937" offset="1651127">They say not one word in their brief about Senate Committee Report 92-61 which states in essence that one and only one practice in subdivision 6105 (d)(1)(B) is presumed to be discriminatory if disparate impact exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.718" offset="1726255">That speaks directly to subdivision (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="407.783" offset="1734510">Subdivision (B) has two types of activities, demotions and dismissals and for the sake of this argument assignment of staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.287" offset="1760528">They are two very distinct clauses in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.944" offset="1771186">That committee report makes it clear that one and only one is presumed to be discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.779" offset="1794487">HEW ignores the language later on in that same Senate committee report where it states, "The phrase disproportionate to demotions or dismissals is not modified nor in any way diminished by the substantive phrase or otherwise engaged in discrimination in the assignment of staff."</text>
            <text syncTime="441.184" offset="1868152">These are two separate and distinct clauses.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.026" offset="1879437">Well, you wouldn't contend, would you, that the rulemaking authority of the agency charged with carrying out the act is necessarily bound to follow the committee reports of one of the Houses of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.066" offset="1935653">Oh, no, they are bound to follow the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.848" offset="1954774">We say the clear intent of the legislature in enacting this is to require an intentional discrimination test for assignment of staff.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.931" offset="1991137">But the reasoning of your last argument, as I understood it, was your reliance on the Senate committee report.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph F. Bruno</label>
            <text syncTime="479.442" offset="2021125">My last argument was the reliance on the Senate committee report indicating what the intent of the legislature was in passing this particular statute and this particular section.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.614" offset="2061876">Let me say further, beyond that, there is other ample proof of what the Congress was talking about when it used the word "discrimination."</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="497.438" stopTime="510.500">

            <text syncTime="497.438" offset="2093119">I don't doubt that it is a factor, but I got the impression that you were saying that the agency charged with making the rule can never go against the language in a committee report.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_f_bruno" startTime="510.500" stopTime="603.490">

            <text syncTime="510.500" offset="2145364">Absolutely not, I am not saying that, but I am saying that that language in that committee report taken with the legislative history, indicates the intent of the discrimination test for this section of the statute which is the eligibility section which is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.762" offset="2202415">In 1972, the language of the section was enacted, the meaning of the word "discrimination" as discussed by Congress, it was very clear what they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.810" offset="2246614">They were talking about Swann, they were talking about Brown, they were talking about intentional segregation, de jure segregation, and they were enacting this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.517" offset="2285484">In fact, Rep. Dellenback said ESAA does not alter in any way the legal aspects of desegregation, its purpose is to help school districts see that existing law is enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.811" offset="2330624">Senator Mondale, in discussing this, talked about Swann and said the only actual discrimination we have is de jure intentional segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.705" offset="2366151">HEW argues that it is equally plausible that discrimination can mean disparate impact and they allude to Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.658" offset="2401991">They ignore, for one, the discussion of desegregation and the cases that we were talking about, of Swann and Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.478" offset="2433233">They ignore that Briggs had come down in March of 1971 and not one statement about Briggs in the Title VII case.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.221" offset="2468237">They ignore that in the third section, 1605(d)(1), discrimination is mentioned twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.507" offset="2497390">They can see in subdivision (d) that it is an intent test, and now they wish to ignore that.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.369" offset="2872822">Now, it could mean that and I would not say that it could not mean that in the context of this statute, but I think if we look at how it was used here and if we consider -- if Congress wanted to say demotions and dismissals, the same test applied to demotions and dismissals and used the same test, all they would have to say is disproportionate to demotions, dismissals, assignment of staff, hiring and promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.343" offset="2964773">They didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.578" offset="2969684">They broke this up in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.640" offset="2977938">To get back to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is why I cite Senate committee Report 92-61, because I think that points out that they were talking about two separate clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.047" offset="3019525">The rationale for the disparate impact test for demotions and dismissals is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.316" offset="3040632">HEW ignores what we say about this in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.373" offset="3052857">Senate committee Report 92-61 points out that Congress was concerned that the districts at this time that had desegregation orders against them were demoting and dismissing black principals and staff in the South, and what Senator Mondale said during the debates was that there have been wholesale firing of black teachers and principals in the South in conjunction with desegregation orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.208" offset="3156198">So when they passed this section dealing with demotions and dismissals, a disproportionate demotions and dismissals in conjunction with desegregation order, so the rationale is very clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="818.359" offset="3376776">They changed the term and they could very easily have kept that term to deal with the remaining elements.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.735" offset="3426304">For one, it doesn't read that way and I say it is illogical.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.952" offset="3443231">They use discrimination twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.384" offset="3452949">HEW relies on another section, and so does the Court of Appeals in finding that a disparate impact that applies to ESAA eligibility, they rely on section 1602(a) of the ESAA statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.131" offset="3511881">At the time that ESAA was introduced, there was considerable discussion in Congress about doing something about de facto segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.930" offset="3539048">They wanted to do something but they realized that the decisions of this Court and elsewhere were prohibiting them from doing something about de facto segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.823" offset="3578650">So what they did was they passed ESAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.604" offset="3585755">They said if you want ESAA money, in order to be eligible you must establish that you are implementing a court ordered desegregation order or you are going to do it voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.297" offset="3624521">What were they trying to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="881.302" offset="3628596">They were trying to do away with de facto segregation by offering a carrot to districts they could not get after the courts, but saying do away with de facto segregation and we will offer you this ESAA funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.871" offset="3670810">Section 1602(a) states -- and so much is placed on this section, there is so much discussion in HEW's brief and in the Court of Appeals -- it states essentially, "that guidelines and criteria of ESAA be applied uniformally without regards to the origin of cause of segregation."</text>
            <text syncTime="908.810" offset="3738624">What that means is that ESAA money be made available to districts regardless of whether it is de jure or de facto segregation, go out and do something, it was broadening these eligibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.796" offset="3778539">They would have us believe that 1602(a) meant a disparate impact test for ESAA eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.551" offset="3801527">Well, if they had meant that, that at least one element of ineligibility in subdivision (b) knocks that logic out totally.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.904" offset="3843009">I would like now to get to the Title VI discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.375" offset="3860877">Perhaps the most -- we feel that perhaps the most important and significant error in the opinion of the Court of Appeals was its failure to assess the impact of the Bakke decision on the standards of discrimination applicable under Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.175" offset="3912077">The Court cited Bakke in its Title VII language but at least I think in our petition for cert inexplicably they said nothing about the Bakke case with respect to Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.429" offset="3953037">Instead, they cited Lau v. Nichols.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.219" offset="3964217">The Court of Appeals relied on Title VI as an additional basis for finding that the disparate impact test applies to ESAA eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.893" offset="3998908">HEW has determined that Title VI is not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.347" offset="4012805">I say it is a rather cavalier determination because in our petition for cert, perhaps the most important and perhaps our strongest point was the Court of Appeals failure to even note the Bakke decision in discussing Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.733" offset="4078320">Title VI, whether it is the standard for ESAA or Title VI is the standard establishing what is discrimination we say in this context, but whether it provides the actual standard for ESAA eligibility or not is certainly interrelated, and let me explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.706" offset="4142164">The Court of Appeals said it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.548" offset="4149582">Their language says that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.446" offset="4157106">The statistics upon which the Court of Appeals and HEW relied in finding the Board ineligible was in Title VI non-compliance letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.711" offset="4190229">Title VI is a major enforcement now for all federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.266" offset="4204440">ESAA is incorporated through a series of amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.130" offset="4243937">Title VI enforces that act and the procedural aspect of enforcement is codified in Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.234" offset="4280299">Secretary Finch during the ESAA debates said, when asked whether a district would be eligible for ESAA funding and it was discriminating in the assignment of teachers, he stated that such a district would not be eligible because it would be violating Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.507" offset="4337351">The Second Circuit in a later decision cited in our main brief, Parents Association of Andrew Jackson, has now said -- I will read it "We think that Title VI does not authorize federal judges to impose a school desegregation remedy where there is no constitutional transgression -- i.e., where a racial imbalance is merely de facto."</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.490" offset="4421360">So even the Second Circuit in issuing this decision was wondering if they did the right thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.212" offset="4444244">They say the continued viability of Lau is suspect and they are waiting this Court's consideration perhaps in this case or another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.728" offset="4486248">The Second Circuit in the Jackson decision went into a bifurcated view of Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.890" offset="4510908">It is in our brief and I really don't think I should go over it in any great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.407" offset="4528985">But what it did was it went through such a tortured reasoning of Title VI to find that in this context, in this very case that a disparate impact test could apply and likened it to Title VII which is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.098" offset="4587813">It did that because it felt that Title VI was extremely relevant, the test was extremely relevant to what the test for ESAA eligibility is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.867" offset="4630862">This is a desegregation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.962" offset="4639222">Even under the Jackson decision of the circuit, we would fall within the intent test that they have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.720" offset="4678301">The appropriate test we say for finding discriminatory intent was set out in the Arlington Heights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.967" offset="4715290">HEW relied on two elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.140" offset="4727933">They used a foreseeability test, citing to the Hart case in the Second Circuit, and on Swann they relied, some language in Swann.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.245" offset="4768371">As this Court has recently held in the Feeney case and in Columbus Board of Education, foreseeability is one element in establishing intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.440" offset="4805151">It is not in and of itself sufficient to establish intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.122" offset="4823855">Secondly, I would like to note that even the circuit, the Second Circuit in the Jackson case has some doubts about the viability of the Hart case that it relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.943" offset="4875160">Lastly, I would like to note that the Swann case relied on by HEW in its finding of ineligibility for the Board of Education cites this language "Disparate racial composition of staff to establish a prima facie case of equal protection of violation."</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.082" offset="4947675">Well, I would say that is somewhat disingenuous to us that clause because in Swann you have a situation where you had de jure segregation and, yes, once you had a prior finding of de jure segregation, then you could use such a test to perhaps imply intent at a later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.082" offset="5019669">Keyes makes that eminently clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.567" offset="5025625">In New York City we had no finding of intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.588" offset="5045687">Your Honors, I would like to ask the Court to have an understanding of the ESAA statute, that ESAA was intended to make money available to districts that were experiencing de facto segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.153" offset="5111933">What else would it be for?</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.994" offset="5119352">It was to assist in doing that, in eliminating de facto segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.781" offset="5138474">HEW argues in their brief that the solution adopted in ESAA was to employ the carrot approach to encourage the voluntary elimination, reduction or prevention of minority group isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.715" offset="5182255">They then continue "It seems evident that with such a starting point, it would make no sense to grant funds to school districts that, although not violating the Constitution, were maintaining a segregated system."</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.887" offset="5226872">The logic is incredible to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.704" offset="5234186">That is what this is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.993" offset="5239306">I thought the money was to be made available to districts that had de facto segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.713" offset="5258219">That is what the intent is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.090" offset="5263757">They would deny it to the very districts that have the type of segregation that this money is intended to work on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.745" offset="5290402">We have an extensive program in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.930" offset="5299075">We are ready to go ahead with that program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.027" offset="5307434">HEW has taken a course that we are not eligible here, we are not eligible under the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.006" offset="5335437">I say that what they are doing is frustrating the legislative purpose, the clear intent of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.899" offset="5354977">Their brief doesn't deal with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.648" offset="5361977">Their brief deals with virtually nothing with respect to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.184" offset="5376084">It talks a bit about 1602, it cites no cases except for the Aspira case, and I think they think that -- if in fact they think it is all right and they want to interpret the legislative intent their way, that is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.904" offset="5438986">I think they have to look a little more closely to what Congress intended.</text>
