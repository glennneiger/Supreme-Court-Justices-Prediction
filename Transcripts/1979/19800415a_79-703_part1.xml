            <text syncTime="341.318" offset="1468688">Certainly, in light of the purposes of the statute, we assume that it would give it a fairly narrow construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.350" offset="1496795">The -- as I say, the question in this appeal is a very narrow one and that is whether because of the labor dispute exception to the overall prohibition on residential picketing, the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.153" offset="1551966">The facts in the case are uncontroverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.399" offset="1564923">One, the plaintiffs are all members of the civil rights organization, and one evening in 1977 about 20 men, members of this organization went to the single family home of the then Mayor of Chicago to picket his house to protest his position on school busing.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.639" offset="1637961">Most of the people who were picketing were arrested and charged with violating the residential picketing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.141" offset="1667950">They were -- they pleaded guilty and they were sentenced to periods of supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.451" offset="1693132">When the periods of supervision had concluded, they filed a suit in Federal District Court in Chicago seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction claiming that the statute violated both their First Amendment rights and their equal protection rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.944" offset="1763140">No, they did not in any way attempt to collaterally attack their former state court conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.446" offset="1789158">The District Court ruled on cross motions for summary judgment with the only evidence in the record being the affidavits of the plaintiffs regarding their intentions to picket in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.894" offset="1839000">They allege that they wanted in the future to picket the Mayor of Chicago again as well as various other residences in Chicago neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.964" offset="1875257">The District Court upheld the statue on both First Amendment grounds and on equal protection grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.341" offset="1900753">The plaintiff appealed and the Seventh Circuit reversed without reaching the First Amendment issues raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.301" offset="1928547">That Court struck the statute on equal protection grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.835" offset="1942758">The Seventh Circuit was impressed by the similarities between the residential picketing statute and the school picketing statute that this Court held unconstitutional in Mosley.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.494" offset="1985390">They noted that each statutes were -- was -- contained a general prohibition of picketing in a certain place with a labor dispute exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.743" offset="2022379">And because of these similarities, the Seventh Circuit wrote that it could find no principle basis of distinction between the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.499" offset="2057383">We appealed because we think that there's an important difference between a statute which protects quiet classrooms and one which promotes residential privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.897" offset="2098970">And we think that this aspect of the appeal is going to turn on the critical and important differences between homes and between schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.876" offset="2138885">Mosley was a regulation passed by the City of Chicago to protect quiet schools and it prohibited all picketing around schools when schools were in session except for labor dispute picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.629" offset="2189876">But as the Court noted in its opinion, both labor picketing and non-labor picketing are equally disruptive of quiet classrooms and the State couldn't offer any good reason why it would tolerate one kind of decept -- deceptive picketing but not another.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.991" offset="2251316">Because of this arbitrary choice, the statute was held unconstitutional on equal protection grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.101" offset="2279737">But Mosley didn't create a per se rule against every labor dispute exception in a picketing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.094" offset="2307741">It -- in fact the opinion itself specifically sets forth the circumstances under which such an exception would be constitutional and that would be what was narrowly tailored and reflected an important state interest that was -- the State was trying to further.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.044" offset="2367509">And we think that the residential picketing statute is just such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.978" offset="2391333">This statute protects all of our rights to be let alone in our own homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.302" offset="2412544">And the legislature of Illinois found that this right is disrupted when people picket our homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.983" offset="2443264">But the legislature also recognized that the resident doesn't have the same right to be let alone in his own home by a stranger who invites him to his house for an employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.018" offset="2499480">This -- this invitation springing in of a stranger dilutes his right of residential privacy as to that stranger and it also creates the mere act of forming the employment relationship, creates rights under state law to picket the place of employment in case a labor dispute arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.995" offset="2587355">Because these two factors are present, the dilution and the creation of the substantive right in the employee to picket, it's reasonable to let the residential employee, but nobody else picket a home which is also a place of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.605" offset="2657782">And in contrast then to the labor dispute exception in the Mosley ordinance which didn't -- didn't have a -- any clear reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.741" offset="2698324">In fact, there's a clear reason for allowing a labor dispute exception in a residential picketing statute which protects residential privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.969" offset="2747225">We think that the reason that the Seventh Circuit couldn't find a basis of a distinction then between this statute and the Mosley ordinance was that the Seventh Circuit focused on the conduct or the picketing that was being prohibited, instead at looking at the interests that the State was trying to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.999" offset="2827368">Now, having shown what the differences are between the Mosley ordinance and the residential picketing statute, I had planned to talk more about the right of residential privacy and about the judgments about that right that the Illinois legislature made in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.106" offset="2895809">In light of the appeal -- the New York Fourth Amendment opinions announced today, I don't think that all elaborate on residential privacy too much but I will note that the Court has been no less solicitous of this interest of being let alone in our own homes in First Amendment cases than it was today in Fourth Amendment case.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.762" offset="3006464">If I understand your argument, you're saying in Mosley, you had schools that may -- and there are difference between just on the kind of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.332" offset="3036662">Whereas here, you got pure homes and homes that are partly homes and partly places of employment and it's fair to distinguish between those two.</text>
