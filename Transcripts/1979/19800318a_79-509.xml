            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear arguments first this morning in Exxon Corporation v. Wisconsin Department of Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.270" offset="148459">Mr. Ragatz, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_g_ragatz" startTime="23.587" stopTime="403.915">
            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Ragatz</label>
            <text syncTime="23.587" offset="197674">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.211" offset="212198">This is an appeal from a decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court that reversed a lower court decision that had excluded from Wisconsin taxation the income of appellant's expiration and production department earned outside the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.590" offset="273742">The basic issue here, as asserted by the appellee, is whether a vertically integrated multistate corporation can be automatically characterized as unitary and automatically required thereby to subject its total corporate income to apportionment even though the taxpayer can conclusively identify and accurately measure its exploration and production income at its situs origin outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.728" offset="402265">Now, contrary to the position of the appellant, the appellee asserts that once a taxpayer is determined to be unitary and engages in any activities in the state of Wisconsin, then virtually all its corporate income is subject to apportionment by Wisconsin and the taxpayer is not permitted to prove extraterritorial taxation by establishing either that the income was derived from sources outside the state of Wisconsin or that the quantity of income attributable to Wisconsin is out of all appropriate proportion to the activities of the taxpayer in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.972" offset="567254">Now, whether or not appellant is found to be unitary is not the basic issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.421" offset="589093">Appellant does not concede that it is a single unitary business, but even assuming arguendo that it is unitary, that does not answer the question of whether the due process and commerce clauses of the United States Constitution permit imposition of the unitary per se approach with full apportionment, regardless of unrefuted proof that the result is to tax situs income derived and accurately measured outside the state of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.629" offset="705912">Appellant's position here involves a two-step analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.113" offset="719809">First, as to what are the constitutional principles previously defined by this Court to limit state taxation of extraterritorial income and, second, as to whether the appellant's proof in the record here satisfies the burden of proof as defined by this Court to establish a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.148" offset="803924">The leading decisions of this Court on apportionment are the Hans Rees case decided in 1931, Bass, Ratcliff decided in 1924, Butler Brothers in 1942, and more recently Moorman Manufacturing company decided in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.372" offset="872887">All of these cases are consistent with the proposition that a taxpayer does have and in fact must have the right -- must have the opportunity to prove the unconstitutionality of an apportionment assessment by establishing a taxation of extraterritorial income.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.813" offset="938611">In Hans Rees, the issue was not whether the taxpayer was unitary, which was assumed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.861" offset="962853">The real issue was whether or not the assessment there taxed income which was earned outside the state of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.580" offset="989706">This Court found a due process violation based upon the taxpayer's proof that the income attributable to North Carolina was out of all appropriate proportion to the activities of the taxpayer in that state thus Hans Rees met its burden of proving extraterritorial taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.317" offset="1060655">This decision was consistent with the prior Bass, Ratcliff case, only there the taxpayer's proof did not establish that New York was taxing income not earned in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.154" offset="1107989">Now, despite the fact that the taxpayer was found to be a so-called unitary business, this Court nevertheless examined the record for proof of extraterritorial taxation, but found such proof to be lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.137" offset="1159920">Butler Brothers involved a similar analysis as to a unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.131" offset="1175907">This Court decision notes that the taxpayer failed to prove that the apportionment formula there attributed to California for taxation income which was earned elsewhere by not showing that the factors responsible for the income were present in other states but were not present in California thus, Butler Brothers failed to sustain its burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.923" offset="1259081">Finally, in Moorman, this Court only commented on the so-called unitary concept in a footnote but did analyze the record and found that the taxpayer did not show that a significant portion of its income being taxed by Iowa was in fact generated outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.260" offset="1340374">The majority opinion by Mr. Justice Stevens notes the lack of "any separate accounting analysis" showing what portion of Moorman's profits were attributable to sales, to manufacturing, or to other portions of the taxpayer's operations, and the opinion expressly suggests that it should not be impossible for a unitary corporation to prove its actual income from activities in a particular state.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.820" offset="1446640">Now, we should note parenthetically here that neither Bass, Ratcliff, Butler Brothers nor Moorman involved situs income which was geographically located and accurately measured outside the taxing state, but that the fact situation here presents such a record for perhaps the first time for the Court to deal with tangible situs income derived from natural resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.839" offset="1550712">Thus, the law as previously decided by this Court expressly recognizes that a taxpayer contesting an assessment under an apportionment cormula must have the opportunity to prove extraterritorial taxation even though deemed to be a unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.329" offset="1612675">As a consequence, it is clear that this Court has consistently treated unitary as a possible condition precedent to the application of an apportionment formula, but has simultaneously made clear that the factual issue of unitary is totally irrelevant to the issue of extraterritorial taxation and to the proof thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.408" offset="1696998">Moreover, until the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which is here before you --</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Ragatz</label>
            <text syncTime="429.697" offset="1822177">We would be saying that you were reaching outside the state to tax extraterritorial income.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.750" offset="1846418">Now, the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court -- until the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court here, it seemed apparent that the Wisconsin statute involved was consistent with the proof prescription contained in these four decisions I have just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.975" offset="1903261">Our section 7107 specifies that a corporation engaged in business within and without the state shall be taxed only on such income as is derived from business transacted or property located within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.974" offset="1955297">But here the Wisconsin Supreme Court dismissed appellant's unrefuted separate functional accounting proof of income earned outside the state by labeling as dicta this Court's prescription in the Moorman decision for proving extraterritorial taxation by separate accounting analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.322" offset="2028648">Thus, the Wisconsin court refused to consider our proof and adopted its unitary per se approach which clearly is totally inconsistent with the prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.538" offset="2077550">Now, under the Wisconsin --</text>

            <text syncTime="494.843" offset="2082774">Just as a matter of curiosity, in your separate accounting how did you allocate the costs of your central office to operations in Wisconsin?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Ragatz</label>
            <text syncTime="503.878" offset="2118928">There are two types of separate accounting in the record, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.259" offset="2140453">There was separate geographical Wisconsin accounting, but the separate accounting that we are really relying on here was the separate functional accounting of the taxpayer's three main functional operating departments, exploration and production, refining and marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.363" offset="2208789">Now, only the marketing department engaged in any activities in Wisconsin, and the trial court found that these three departments were organized and operated as separate segments and separate functional operations and this decision was affirmed by the Wisconsin Circuit Court on the first level of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.820" offset="2290604">Now, the trial court also found that the taxpayer used internal transfer prices between its functional departments that were the equivalent to third-party competitive prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.578" offset="2345671">Now, that finding of fact was not even appealed by the state, were not even challenged by the state on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.660" offset="2373987">The trial court further found that the income of each of appellant's functional operating departments could be determined from its books and records without resort to actual third-party sales.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Ragatz</label>
            <text syncTime="589.024" offset="2459460">The finding of fact that the accounting for the functional departments could be determined from the taxpayer's books and records also was not appealed, not challenged on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.528" offset="2509511">Now, the fact that these two findings were not challenged means that the appellee has conceded the validity and the accounting integrity of the determination of the exploration and production department net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.260" offset="2560397">Now, that is a long way around to answer your question, but I felt the background was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.763" offset="2578474">The central office charges were allocated on the basis of similar to a cost of service arrangement with the various functional departments, and again this was not challenged by the State of Wisconsin and the separate functional accounting for each of these operating departments, including particularly the exploration and production department, stands unrefuted and unchallenged in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="783.487" offset="3237282">The test applied by the Wisconsin Supreme Court to determine what is unitary begs the question of whether or not the particular activity has any rational relationship to the activities in the State of Wisconsin which would authorize the state without violating due process to tax that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.834" offset="3310738">And we assert here that the exploration and production income which was generated entirely outside the state, which could be identified at its geographical location, which could be accurately measured there, and the measurement has not even been challenged, that this demonstrates that that exploration and production income is extraterritorial, it has no relation to the state of Wisconsin.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.433" offset="5389145">I believe the language of the Court was that the taxpayer did not meet the factual predicate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.566" offset="5569599">I want to mention one, however, that the trial court did find as a fact that the Wisconsin taxation of the appellant's exploration and production and its refining net income subjected the appellant to multiple state taxation on such income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.246" offset="5624351">And on appeal at the first level in the Wisconsin Circuit Court, this finding of multiple state taxation was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.744" offset="5654340">However, that was subsequently reversed, along with the finding of three unitary businesses when the Wisconsin Supreme Court took its unitary per se approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.758" offset="5690389">Now, the factual basis for the findings of fact are unrefuted in the record, particularly those findings of fact that were reversed as a matter of law, and the finding of three unitary businesses was reversed as a matter of law without consideration of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.652" offset="5761964">But the factual record here specifically identifies by separate functional accounting the undisputed income of the exploration and production function which was earned entirely outside the state of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.878" offset="5806895">The record shows the geographical locations and it shows the $2.6 million worth of exploration and production income which is included in the Wisconsin assessment, and all of this income was subject to being taxed in the states of its origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.826" offset="5858722">Now, this clearly supports the finding of fact of the trial court that the assessment at issue subjected the appellant to multiple state taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1472.184" offset="5992155">Well, the years in issue here were 1965 through 1968, so I am not aware of any windfall profits and certainly there is nothing in the record that would indicate anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.742" offset="6042311">My personal answer to the question, which is not in the record and I would have to qualify it in attempting to answer your question, would be that windfall profits might -- if that is an appropriate term, and I guess I am not willing to accept the term -- but large profits might be measured from the exploration and production department, where the exploration and production was done in the 1920's at the 1920 level of prices, and the sales of the oil and gas are done at today's prices, you are going to show a large gross profit on such sales which somebody might call a windfall profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.633" offset="6157876">But when you consider the replacement costs of those reserves, it is hard for me to think of that as a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.469" offset="6185253">I would like to remind the Court that the issue, the integrity of the determination of the exploration and production income is not at issue and the appellee should not be heard to dispute the fact that the record shows the correct amount of the exploration and production income, nor should the appellee be allowed to dispute the fact that the record shows that that income was earned entirely outside the state of Wisconsin, nor the fact that the assessment in issue includes a significant portion of that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.525" offset="6317432">Thus, based upon the proof from the Court's prescription for finding extraterritorial taxation, I respectfully submit that these facts must invalidate the assessment, and I respectfully request that the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court be reversed on the basis that section 7107 of the Wisconsin statutes is unconstitutional as applied here by the appellee to tax the exploration and production net income earned outside the state, and that such application constitutes a violation of both the due process and the commerce clauses of the United States Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.171" offset="6788054">The appellees here ask this Court to reaffirm what has been already said in Butler Brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.143" offset="6815953">Exxon in the instant case has not challenged the Wisconsin formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.887" offset="6834970">It has challenged the right of Wisconsin to apply its three-factor formula to some of its business income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.906" offset="6878960">One of the terms used is situs income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.503" offset="6901426">Now, the unitary approach, the three-factor unitary method takes into consideration situs income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.251" offset="6932355">All three of the denominators are based on situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.423" offset="6957014">The income that appellant is talking about as situs income is income from a unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.673" offset="6990033">Now, a unitary business is by definition a single, one business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.422" offset="7009050">Income from such businesses cannot be attributed to it in part, it cannot be attributed to parts or to part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.127" offset="7043845">The basis of the unitary concept is that income cannot be a function of any given factor, but it is a function of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.868" offset="7074879">Situs is taken into consideration by Wisconsin and by 40 other states who have adopted a similar three-factor formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.656" offset="7109987">The basis for the formula essentially is an attempt by the states to find a reasonable formula in which to tax large multi-state unitary businesses in a uniform and equitable manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.992" offset="7167352">I believe that this formula that Wisconsin has adopted and that several, forty-some other states have adopted does just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.522" offset="7205491">Wisconsin is not taxing extraterritorial income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.822" offset="7222627">Wisconsin has never admitted that these figures shown by the appellant proves that it is taxing extraterritorial income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.098" offset="7263796">We are not disputing a separate functional accounting or whatever they want to call it for their own business purposes, but they have no income from exploration and production unless this Court is going to go back to the imputed income theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.483" offset="7321266">The income is the income from their total unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.270" offset="7336417">Wisconsin applied its formula, it taxed 1/500th of that income.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.206" offset="7864195">But yes, you're right, they might prefer to tax that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1968.868" offset="7978820">I think one of the basic points I would like to make is that Wisconsin does have a three-factor formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.308" offset="8000554">Now, during the period there was one little discrepancy between some of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.881" offset="8014869">We had the cost of manufacturing rather than payroll, but essentially it meant the same thing and the enumerator in that case was zero, so Exxon only came out ahead if anything on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.617" offset="8053844">But essentially it is uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.115" offset="8071816">And going back to Adams Express and going through Butler Brothers, this Court has recognized that it is difficult to tax multi-state unitary businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.572" offset="8105671">I am not here to suggest anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.356" offset="8116746">I am suggesting there has been an approach adopted by most of the authorities, I think it is a reasonable approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.323" offset="8136704">It has been adopted by Wisconsin and, like I said, forty-some other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.299" offset="8156557">That alone is designed to prevent duplicate taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.718" offset="8174216">It is also designed to tax if we have the perfect formula no more than 100 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.535" offset="8205563">It is designed to tax exactly that and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.855" offset="8214758">Unfortunately, a lot of the states, including Wisconsin, exclude certain income, so I don't even think it ever would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.040" offset="8235551">Now, you can constantly attack such a formula by stating, well, if Wisconsin had put in payroll some false figures, they obviously can attack that formula on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.246" offset="8284348">But to attack the three-factor formula in a unitary approach through the use of separate accounting I think is inconsistent with a lot of this Court's decisions --</text>

            <text syncTime="2111.484" offset="8549334">I suppose if all of Exxon's production was owned by a separate company, an independent company, and its refining was owned by an independent company, and its marketing by an independent company, there wasn't common ownership but they did business in the same way, there was the same flow of oil from well to refinery to marketing, it would be -- economically it would be the same operation, but you certainly couldn't treat it as a unitary business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.268" offset="12976462">He is dealing with this illusive, ill-defined concept of unitary and saying that if the state determines that a taxpayer is unitary, then automatically thereafter the income is subject to apportionment and don't confuse us with the facts from a separate accounting analysis because they don't count.</text>

            <text syncTime="3266.397" offset="13168933">But to apply it to the extraterritorial income which the record conclusively proves was identified and accurately measured outside the state, it gets us right square into both the due process and the commerce clause analysis.</text>
