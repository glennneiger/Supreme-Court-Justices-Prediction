            <text syncTime="47.321" offset="292655">That -- it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.009" offset="295372">But the question is what did Congress intend and the Government says and we deny that organized crime, according to the legislative history, use commercial bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.014" offset="347408">Whereas as we have pointed out, the Government in its brief in -- in Nardello and view expressed by -- adopted by this Court in footnote 11, page 293 said, "Bribery has traditionally focused upon corrupt activities by public officials."</text>
            <text syncTime="84.695" offset="442180">Now, if I may turn to the next principle upon which I rely, it is that of the common law definition assumed to be that of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.409" offset="485021">I touched on it an answer to a question put by Justice Rehnquist and I want to leave that by simply referring this Court through its decisions in Turley and in Morissette, particularly to Mr. Justice Jackson's comment in Morissette that when Congress borrows terms of art, which are accumulated legal tradition meaning of centuries, it normally intends to adopt those views.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.918" offset="603094">Turning next to the federal complex of statutes and state statutes, I treat them briefly because all they are, are guide posts and the significant aspect, if Congress looked at the state statutes and said, "What is considered bribery," significant aspects are in contrast in Nardello which again I will touch on more fully, there was a clear line of demarcation between the state statutes dealing with bribery and called bribery, although the name is not critical, it's the line of demarcation that's important and the state statutes dealing with commercial bribery of various variations.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.380" offset="780936">And this line of demarcation is followed by the codifiers by those who prepare the American Law Institute people who prepared the penal -- model penal codes by the working papers of the Brown Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.816" offset="846660">And indeed, by the very legislation now pending before the Congress, the currently new code -- new criminal code in which a distinction is recognized as it is in the textbooks like Perkins and others to which the Government refers between crimes against sovereignty and crimes against property.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.592" offset="933700">I have in our brief delineated the examples of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.969" offset="1183222">I don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.242" offset="1188342">I think the real question is what the Congress had in mind in passing the statue and Congress did not have in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.803" offset="1214568">I may say, despite Senator Keating's passing observations at the end of congressional hearings with respect to a sports bribery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.130" offset="1251871">To me, the critical problem which we face here before the Court is that on which the Government takes issue with us and that is, "What is the meaning of Nardello?"</text>
            <text syncTime="298.325" offset="1296697">I already said what the Court said in Nardello with respect to bribery, but why did the Court decide Nardello as it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.819" offset="1342673">It'll be very strange if the Court expanded bribery -- in this case, if this Court expanded bribery in this case, we'll you use the term broadly, I don't want to beg the question, when the broad definition of extortion in Nardello was based upon the Government's argument in Nardello, that this broad definition of extortion was required because there was a narrow conception of bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.863" offset="1514872">Now, taking Nardello on the merits, Nardello was based upon a legislative history in which Attorney General Kennedy said, "Their organized crime used extortion."</text>
            <text syncTime="365.793" offset="1566595">It was based upon the blending by legislation and judicial decision of extortion and blackmail unlike our line of demarcation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.614" offset="1613824">It was based upon the fact that as the Government pointed out so well in its Nardello brief upon which most of my knowledge comes here that extortion by legislators alone was inconsistent, where the statute directed an extortion by organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.908" offset="1695013">And finally, the Court said, "Obviously, we defer to that, take note I have no problem with it," that labels of blackmail could not obscure the fact that Nardello was engaged in extorsion of conduct even under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.616" offset="1765857">Now, I want to suggest also to the Court as we have in the last pages of our brief that an expansive interpretation of the term "bribery" would -- under Rewis and many other decisions of the Court all too sensitive federal state relationships by transforming minor offences into federal felonies and I think that as the Court said in Bass, I think it was Mr. Justice Marshall who wrote the opinion there.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.499" offset="1917367">"Unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly," I'm using the Justice's words, "then this kind of restructuring could take care of minor crimes, is impermissible and indeed, this restructuring is as rather strange thing because it's an anachronism even in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.823" offset="2006706">Thus, for example 29 U.S.C 186 (a) which deals with gratuities to have trade union officials is a misdemeanor and Section 215 of 18 U.S.C. refers to gratuities received by a banking official as a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.925" offset="2091029">This statute would made -- would make a telephone call to a banking official or from him where a telephone call by a labor union agent, a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.685" offset="2134079">I think therefore that the -- you have a problem with respect to the restructuring the -- of the federal system as well as the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.759" offset="2166366">Now, this is in my view, if I may suggest it, exactly the kind of case with which this Court dealt in discussing the principle of lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.731" offset="2242330">It is a case where in the words of Bachelder and Culbert, words do not plainly impose meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.987" offset="2283290">We don't know which dictionary definition was chosen even in the Oxford to take the Government's example.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.831" offset="2318712">We don't know whether the common law should be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.082" offset="2335744">We don't know whether the principle of (Inaudible), namely that you can still -- penal laws narrowly should be disregarded, it take all of those considerations and it calls here for a principle of lenity which this Court, I think in the Dunn case pointed out has a constitutional basis in Ex Post Facto principles and --</text>

            <text syncTime="603.417" offset="2517034">I think the problem here is the construction of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.070" offset="2531662">And the construction of a statute, whether the issue had been raised below or not, call for the principle of lenity, particularly, where you have here a very minor, I think a -- a small fish, I'm paraphrasing, was the word used by -- by Judge Rubin dissenting in the court below in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.292" offset="2632495">I would also urge the Court in considering this problem to note that this is probably the third case in 18 years involving the application to commercial bribery of Section 1252.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.045" offset="2711594">At least, we have not been able to find any and of course we know in Brecht -- in Brecht, the Court came to different conclusion so we are left here with a Pomponio and this apparent situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.434" offset="2769063">This is clearly the kind of a case where we cannot say it was said in -- in Scarborough, that there is a clear history.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.247" offset="2820368">This is the kind of a case in which we -- the history is on our side and I think that construction of the word, bearing in mind its long history is on our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.607" offset="2877837">Now, to conclude at least for the moment, let me suggest to the Court what it is asked by the Government to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.788" offset="2926529">It is asked by the Government to define a criminal statute which is at best ambiguous, which has been enforced against the defendant twice or group of defendants twice in 18 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.084" offset="3011688">It has asked to construe it differently from the common law, broadly rather than strictly, although it's a penal statute, under a definition which among others may be found in popular dictionaries or even learned dictionaries like Oxford under a definition which is contrary to that of all legal dictionary that I've seen which when they use the term commercial bribery, use it as a separate heading.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.180" offset="3148048">It has asked to construe it contrary to legislative history of which there is very little of whatever is on our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.651" offset="3189948">It has asked to construe it contrary -- contrary to the views expressed to this Court by the Solicitor General of the United States in Nardello and the passage to which I referred Your Honors in the original briefs, and I submit my very high regards to that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.307" offset="3312619">And I'm sure the courts of course leaves it to conclude that the Solicitor General that not suggest that bribery had a narrow definition, if I can call it narrow, limited to public officials for strategic reasons in Nardello, but it stated its view in Nardello with reason and with thoughtfulness and with a knowledge of legal history.</text>

            <text syncTime="849.359" offset="3500805">The Government contends that the Travel Act prohibits the use of interstate facilities to promote all forms of bribery, illegal under state or federal law, including commercial bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.271" offset="3552423">In establishing that proposition, we rely on the text of the Travel Act, the contemporary meaning of the words used in the Act and the Act's legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.204" offset="3596204">In addition, we rely on this Court's decision in the case of United States against Nardello, which provides the rule of statutory interpretation which we believe is controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.817" offset="3646673">I'd like now to take up each of these points separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.812" offset="3662660">The literal terms of the Travel Act extend to bribery in violation of the laws of the United States or the State in which the crime is committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.621" offset="3701844">Unlike other federal criminal statutes such as the official bribery statute, the Travel Act does not limit its coverage to a particular kind of bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.537" offset="3741550">Without any limiting modifier, the term bribery has a generic meaning that is the giving or the receipt of something of value in order to corrupt the judgment or the action of someone in the position of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.273" offset="3804453">The ordinary meaning of the word bribery includes official corruption but it's not limited to official corruption as Webster's Dictionary reminds us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.434" offset="4209142">We -- we depend on a violation of the Louisiana statute facilitated through the use of interstate facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.906" offset="4239026">Counsel has contended for a common law definition of the word bribery pointing to the legal dictionaries which he contends are different from the popular dictionaries, but Black's Law Dictionary defines a bribe -- bribery as the offering or soliciting of anything of value to influence action as an official or in discharge of legal duty and it gives us examples, common law bribery and commercial bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.964" offset="4363264">The same is true in Wharton's law-lexicon which defines a bribe as a gift to any person, office or holding a position of trust with the object of inducing him to disregard his official duty or betray his trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.036" offset="4427525">Again, the examples that are given are official bribery and bribery of agents and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.110" offset="4451767">The legal dictionaries use the term the same way Webster's Dictionary and the Oxford Dictionary uses the word as a generic designation covering both official and non-official bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.602" offset="4505788">Instead of designating a particular kind of bribery such as official bribery, the statute refers to bribery offenses prohibited under the laws of Congress or the laws of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.956" offset="4555212">Because the scope of the Act is delineated by reference to state or federal bribery law, we believe that it is most significant that a large number of state and several bribery laws passed prior to the enactment of the Travel Act, explicitly extended to non-official bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.004" offset="4631385">This -- this pattern of statutes confirms that in contemporary legal usage in 1961, the term bribery had a far broader meaning than official bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.157" offset="4679973">Prior to enactment of the Travel Act, Congress prescribed non-official bribery in a variety of different criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.271" offset="4708498">For example, Congress prohibited bribery in the sale of liquor, bribery in the procurement of interstate transportation and bribery of contestants of clearing in television quiz shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.648" offset="4757922">The situation in the states is similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.369" offset="4768893">By 1961, 43 states had adopted criminal laws prohibiting various forms of non-official bribery, including bribery of employees and agents, bribery of workers in particular kinds of industries, bribery of labor union officials, and bribe -- bribery of athletes participating in sporting events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.608" offset="4857814">Because of this statute's coverage is defined by reference to state and federal bribery law, the widespread existence of statutes forbidding commercial and other forms of non-official bribery is a strong indication that the Travel Act should have a coextensive reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.587" offset="4929703">We submit that it would be highly inappropriate to assume that Congress was unaware of the fact that most of the States in the union had enacted criminal laws forbidding non-official corruption and it would be even more extraordinary to assume that Congress was unaware of its own criminal legislation making commercial bribery a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.932" offset="5019146">Although the legislative history of the statute is limited, the hearings show that the proponents of the statute understood the contemporary generic meaning of the word bribery.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.148" offset="5387995">No congressman or representative from the Department of Justice ever suggested that the Act should be limited to official bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.852" offset="5422791">The legislative history also shows that the dominant purpose of the Travel Act was to cut off the flow of profits to organized criminals by depriving them of the use of interstate facilities to carry on their illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.814" offset="5486634">For this reason, the statute prohibits arson and extortion, both of which are used by criminals to prey on honest business firms and to increase illicit revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.186" offset="5532087">Commercial bribery is likewise used by organized crime to increase the flow of money which Congress meant to cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.505" offset="5565419">Congressional hearings, both before and after enactment of the statute confirm the extent to which criminals make use of commercial bribery to infiltrate honest business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2518.665" offset="10178017">As this Court has repeatedly pointed out, the very purpose of the Act was to aid local law enforcement officials by punishing persons who use interstate facilities to carry on the designated illegal activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2541.340" offset="10268714">Congress believed that interstate schemes to carry on bribery in violation of either federal or state law posed a serious national threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.634" offset="10309883">And where the facilities of interstate commerce are used, it is for Congress to select the means necessary to punish and deter the offenders.</text>

            <text syncTime="2568.248" offset="10376338">He argues in this connection that the statute is vague and that it must therefore be narrowly construed in his favor, but the Travel Act does not present a vagueness problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.426" offset="10417089">The statute's literal realm extends to bribery without limitation on its kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="2599.627" offset="10501831">The legislative history of the Act, although it's sparse, shows that its proponents viewed the term bribery in a contemporary generic sense and the dominant statutory purpose that is cutting off the flow of money to organized crime strongly supports the view that commercial bribery should be covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.962" offset="11415176">I should like to read to the Court the Government's language in its brief in Nardello at page 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.337" offset="11452688">"Furthermore," said the Government, "joined in the same clause with extortion, is an offense which has its normal focus, the corruption of public officers interstate travel to promote 'bribery'" is also forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.992" offset="11547355">In this context, reading extortion as confined only to acceptance of unauthorized fees by public officials would render the extortion branch -- sorry, would render -- would render the extortion branch of the clause practically superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.461" offset="11645262">The Government there took the firm position that where corruption is involved, it had to have, at least it would persuade the Court to take a broad definition of extortion because as it said, the corruption of public officials was being handled by the bribery provision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="2965.333" offset="11964688">Yes, of course that's perfectly valid and of course, the Court in Nardello with its footnote seemed to accept that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.644" offset="12001991">Now, if this is a question that we're now construing not only the meaning of the term bribery but we're now construing what the Government's concession meant, just simply adds another element to the indefiniteness of what we are treating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.556" offset="12057579">The Government, and of course I have reference with all due respect to then Deputy Attorney General's tying in of the term bribery to the term official bribery or limiting it to that and the same thing was true of the Attorney General Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.156" offset="12131976">Your Honors will recall what Government counsel just said, when he was asked about what's the major legislative support that he has for believing that bribery, means commercial bribery -- means that commercial bribery and his answer was, "Senator Keating's observations un-supports bribery."</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.123" offset="12219852">You look at, if I may suggest it, the hearings in the case and you'll see how this somewhat personalized statement by a single legislator that nobody caught on to, that was passed over, and this is considered the largest legislative support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.881" offset="12298846">I suggest if we want to see other support for my position that we look at 18 U.S.C. 1961. 1961 is a statute which talks about bribery, in one case, refers to Section 201 as relating to bribery and then talks about Section 224, not as relating to bribery, but as relating sports bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.862" offset="12410859">At best, we have an ambiguity here as to the meaning of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.444" offset="12429145">The Government has referred, Your Honor, also to references to labor corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.475" offset="12461223">I touched down in a moment before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.037" offset="12471568">Your Honors will see at pages 31, 246 and 272 of the House hearings, I haven't put that on a brief but perhaps I can, shortly in a letter, if Your Honor permits, the Government was talking about the Immunity Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.551" offset="12549622">There was not a word -- a proposed marriot, there is not a word in dealing with this statute about labor corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.578" offset="12585671">The Government pulls out now what the Congress must've known about a statute passed in 1906 in Great Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.023" offset="12615450">Again, if this is how we are to interpret legislation, then I suggest it gives an air of ambiguity to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.854" offset="12654738">On the dictionaries, I have addressed myself to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.802" offset="12666546">I would urge Your Honors to look at those dictionaries and see whether those dictionaries are not consistently, in my favor, if they are illegal dictionaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.078" offset="12707715">But quite aside from that, all they do really is indicate that there is ambiguity in the meaning of the word bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.509" offset="12745435">And the question is whether in this case, unlike many others, appeal statute, whether or not the statute is to be construed broadly or narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.038" offset="12791515">A reference has been made to the open-ended aspect of the statute, as read by the Government, and it's been suggested that there are ways out for it, but if you take my construction of the statute, which I think is Congress' and then only Congress' view and not what a state law says and not what one dictionary or another says, it is Congress' view, mine gives a non open-ended situation because public bribery, governmental bribery has a precise meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.803" offset="12934562">Under the Government's definition, the moment a state passes a statute like Wisconsin, for example, providing for a $25 fine for gratuity, because a gratuity paid to a chauffeur, we then have a real open-ended situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.905" offset="13003003">Did Congress intend to make the $25 gratuity to a chauffeur or a $100 to a lumberman in some other State?</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.432" offset="13049083">Did it intend to include that in the term bribery?</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.826" offset="13062666">There is no suggestion in the legislative history that it did but if one looks at it, if we can stand aside and say, "What could Congress had meant in passing the statute directly to organized crime where they had no evidence that organized crime was using commercial bribery?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.015" offset="13131421">It had a concrete function and purpose, which a National legislator -- Legislature would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.339" offset="13168724">There is a very serious crime in the bribery of public officials, the one referred to by Deputy Attorney General White and by Attorney General Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.412" offset="13220968">Bribery of public officials is a critical matter, deserves a national attention and is the most reasonable application of the Travel Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.564" offset="13261615">But to say now that because bribery could be interpreted by some definitions to be broad, when commercial bribery has a line of demarcation, I've indicated before, is also to disregard what a reasonable Congress would have intended in addressing itself to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.028" offset="13359522">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
