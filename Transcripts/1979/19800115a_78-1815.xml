            <text syncTime="68.142" offset="375933">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.297" offset="388577">This case presents the question of whether claims to oil shale on federal lands made some sixty or more years ago under the mineral laws, the mining laws I should say, pardon me, of 1870 and 1872 are valid and entitle the claimant successors an interest to patents under those laws conveying title to these public lands to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.529" offset="501530">Such unpatented oil shale claims are outstanding on an estimated five million acres of public lands in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.261" offset="544371">All of the claims date from before February 25, 1920, which was the date of enactment of the Mineral Leasing Act which withdrew oil shale and other specified minerals from further location under the mining laws and provided for future access to these minerals only by leasing with the title to the lands remaining in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.057" offset="667564">The law was part of the conservation movement designed for protection of the public domain from what Congress considered to be unwarranted alienation by claims to widespread minerals specified in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.440" offset="745096">The particular claims at issue here date from 1917 and 1918, in the period this Court has characterized in Hickel v. Oil Shale Company is one of speculative fever in oil shale claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.065" offset="819597">And the precise question involved is whether the precise claims are invalid because of the failure of Oil Shale to meet the requirement of the mining law of discovery of a valuable mineral deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.284" offset="884485">In this case, the Administrative Law Judge, the Interior Board of Land Appeals, the District Court and the Court of Appeals all agreed that the claim did not meet the traditional discovery standard under the mining laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.068" offset="1419682">The basis for the holding of the four tribunals below is set forth on page 24 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.767" offset="1458448">And on page 25 -- I am turning myself to page 24, the Administrative Law Judge based his holding on this aspect, if I may just read the bottom part of the quoted portion "Until a research program had demonstrated that shale oil could be produced at a cost competitive with petroleum, no prudent person would attempt to develop an oil shale mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.636" offset="1565968">He would have no market for his product.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.327" offset="1576730">The very fact that, in the more than half a century of interest in oil shale claims of the Green River Formation, not one profitable mine has been developed is a compelling reason for concluding that expenditure of money to that end would be imprudent."</text>
            <text syncTime="384.332" offset="1640678">And indeed the Board of Appeals pointed out that no profitable operation of any kind from oil shale has been developed in this country in a hundred years.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.491" offset="1789367">Well, it can only change its position in interpretation of the law, but as I am about to demonstrate to the Court, if I may, Freeman v. Summers was inconsistent with prior decisions of this Court construing the very law that Interior misconstrued in Freeman v. Summers.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.137" offset="1867943">And if I can proceed to show that, I then would submit that the Interior Department had no choice but to conform its practices to this Court's interpretation of the mining law, that law has not been changed by Congress and this Court has not overruled, indeed it has reaffirmed those interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.639" offset="1961880">So this is not really a question of the Interior Department's discretion to change its own interpretation of the law, it is really a matter of conforming its interpretation to this Court's authoritative interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.681" offset="2162082">It can happen within an area of an agency's discretion to construe terms of a statute which can fairly be construed in different ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.647" offset="2197922">Well, you don't think for example we would be free to having perhaps construed the law differently than Freeman did, to later say Freeman was correctly decided?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="536.798" offset="2250585">Well, the difficulty is that Freeman never purported to apply a different standard to anything but oil shale and the Interior Department over the years adhered to this Court's interpretation of the mining laws for all other minerals and there is no statutory basis for treating oil shale differently from other minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.340" offset="2336684">There is no arguable interpretation of the statute that can support this disparity in administrative practice that the department has now corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.425" offset="2389034">The customary standard has been articulated in a number of this Court's modern decisions as a reflecting a determination by Congress that public lands would be virtually free for the taking by private interests under the mining laws in return for the discovery of a commercially valuable mineral deposit that can enure to the public benefit by being introduced into the economy, and for that reason the profitability and marketability of a mining claim to exploit that resources has been the consistent standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.064" offset="2579623">Rather than refer to the more familiar recent decisions, I would like, if I may, to turn to some of the earlier decisions in which this standard was established.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.348" offset="2640750">One that we have cited in our brief is Cameron v. United States, 252 U.S., which was decided in 1920, less than two months after the enactment of the Mineral Leasing Act, and there a unanimous opinion written by Mr. Justice Vander, whom the Court later recognized as having unique knowledge in this field, the Court articulated the meaning of a valuable mineral discovery in much the terms that the modern cases do.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.420" offset="2801037">And if I may support from page 459 "To support a mining location, discovery should be such as would justify a person of ordinary prudence in the further expenditure of his time and means in an effort to develop a paying mine."</text>
            <text syncTime="692.943" offset="2875120">And then quite significantly this is not a novel or mistaken test but is one which the land department long has applied and this Court has approved, citing Christman v. Miller, 197 U.S., a 1905 decision of this Court and also a unanimous decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.228" offset="2964250">The particular page reference in Christman v. Miller -- and this is also a case that is cited in brief, it is in 197 U.S. -- is page 322 which quoted with approval the classic statement reproduced on page 19 of our brief of the Interior Department in Castle v. Womble of the standard which is largely along the same lines as set forth on page 19 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.881" offset="3106879">But of perhaps even greater pertinence to the particular question before us now is the precise holding of Christman v. Miller, and I would like to quote two sentences from the concluding paragraph of this Court's opinion there, page 323 of 197 U.S. Referring to the claimant whose claims were rejected below and the judgment rejecting those claims was being affirmed, there was not enough in what he claims to have seen to have justified a prudent person in the expenditure of money and labor in exploitation for petroleum.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.513" offset="3277406">It merely suggested a possibility that the ground contained oil sufficient to make it chiefly valuable therefore, and that was not enough under the mining law.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.622" offset="3329860">Now, if we turn from that to the Interior Department's opinion in 1927, 22 years later, in Freeman v. Summers, and this on page 67 of the appendix in the case, I would like to call the Court's attention to the next to the last paragraph of that opinion in which the rationale used by the Interior Department was precisely the rationale that this Court rejected in interpreting the same law in the Christman case "There can be no question whatever as to the greater valuable the lands for their oil shale deposits than for other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.444" offset="3521181">Their agricultural value is negligible; their value for grazing purposes is nominal, and the real and principal value is the mineral deposits," precisely what this Court held not to qualify as a basis for upholding a claim to a valuable mineral deposit under the mining law.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.265" offset="3604459">In retrospect, what started out in the early twenties, when the Interior Department first began patenting oil shale claims as predominantly in the state of fact that oil shale might be then meeting the standard under the mining law as interpreted in this Court's cases, because of optimistic predictions of the imminence of marketability of oil shale, it started off in the initial patents as predominantly a mistake of fact and we noted incidentally in our brief on page 29 that the instructions of the Secretary under which these initial patents were granted did not say that oil shale could proceed to patent under any different standards and indeed said that the same standards must be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1011.988" offset="4151359">Does the record tell us whether the decision in Christman v. Miller was called to anyone's attention and considered before the decision was made?</text>

            <text syncTime="1022.595" offset="4193782">It does show that the Solicitor in the department and all of his subordinates refused to draft the opinion because they thought that it was reflecting an incorrect standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.518" offset="4245400">The point I was just making was that what started off in the early twenties as what seems to me in retrospect to be a predominantly mistake of fact was then perpetuated as an administrative practice through what is clearly a mistake of law in applying a standard that is contradictory to this Court's reading of the mining law to oil shale without any basis in the statute for singling out oil shale for different treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.156" offset="4376012">So the background against which any action Congress has subsequently taken is to be judged at most as an element of ambiguity introduced by the administrative practice that coexisted with this Court's decisions looking the other way as to what the governing legal standard was under the mining law long before any of the developments with respect to oil shale that are put in issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1122.445" offset="4593142">Yes, but the instructions did not make a mistake of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.907" offset="4607039">They noted that there was a great deal of development with respect to oil shale, a great deal of interest in it and said, as we quote on the top of page 29 of our brief, that the same legal standard should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.145" offset="4659911">And under those instructions, the functionaries in the department then began issuing patents on oil shale which in retrospect, as I have said, looks like a mistake of fact but not a mistake of law predominantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.927" offset="4723127">These things emerge with greater clarity in retrospect perhaps than at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.715" offset="4746219">But I would say that when the basis for the mistake in fact, the mistake of fact began to dissipate, rather than change the practice, the practice was perpetuated in Freeman v. Summers by a mistake of law, adopted by the Assistant Secretary over the objection of the Solicitor's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.748" offset="4846320">So it isn't really accurate in our submission to judge any subsequent action has taken as if it were taken against a background of settled law in favor of these oil shale claims as qualifying under the mining law when this Court's decisions looked the other way in construing the language of the act and the legal standard to be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1339.171" offset="5460093">No, it wasn't, but Freeman v. Summers in our submission an aberration from the Womble standard which was the predominant view approved by the Court over and over again, expenditure of labor and means with a reasonable prospect of success in developing a valuable mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.090" offset="5555702">Certainly no formulation that had ever made contemplated holding of fallow claims and dealing in them for a period of more than sixty years while nothing could be returned to the public and then valid claims could be made for alienation of a large acreage of the public domains on the basis of that kind of holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.047" offset="5663535">I don't think there is any formulation which would look toward that kind of speculative interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.073" offset="5687672">It is precisely what this Court said in Coleman was not authorized under the mining law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.162" offset="5724035">I would like to make one basic point about the reading that is proposed of the savings clause in the Mineral Leasing Act, and that is the implausibility of that reading as a matter of the common sense of what Congress was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.475" offset="5805223">The basic purpose of the Mineral Leasing Act was put an end to alienation of the public lands through mining claims based on some of the more widespread mineral resources which it appeared would result in very widespread alienation of the public lands beyond what could be exploited in the near future because the minerals were so widespread.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.093" offset="5923715">The ones that were singled out in that law, oil shale, coal, oil phosphate, were ones that were thought to exist in such great quantity as to endanger wholesale alienation of the public lands beyond the purposes for the original mining law of giving people a way to get title in return for commercial exploitation of valuable mineral resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.852" offset="6058820">There had to be some savings provision as Congress developed the law both because of Fifth Amendment problems with whatever rights people had in their claims under the old mining law and to prevent unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.671" offset="6122036">But it obviously would be contrary to the whole purpose of the legislation to read into the savings provision an intent to make further alienation of the public lands possible through claims on oil shale than had been authorized by the prior law when the whole purpose of the act was to curtail alienations of the public lands through such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.264" offset="6236453">It was dissatisfaction with the old system and the possibility that these wholesale alienations would occur through claims on the specified minerals that led to the passage of the act in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.549" offset="6293608">So it would take a compelling indication in the language or history of the statute to conclude that the savings clause should be interpreted at cross purposes with the basic thrust of the legislation and the thing that moved Congress to enact it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.043" offset="6359542">And far from that we have, as this Court recognized in the Hickel case, a carefully drafted provision in the savings clause that refers to the standards of the mining law having to be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.816" offset="6418683">The two subsequent developments in Congress referred to did not result in, in one case in any legislation and in the other case in anything that could conceivably be construed as affecting the standards of discovery because it was devoted to a discrete matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.875" offset="6498826">I would like to reserve the balance of my time, if I may.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fowler Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="1615.638" offset="6565909">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.474" offset="6569253">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.750" offset="6582418">After a few preliminary observations by way of background, my discussion will present the law and the facts insofar as they relate to six points that in our view are relevant to the consideration of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.765" offset="6638425">The first will have to do with the problem that Congress and Executive Branch faced in when in 1916 they discovered in consequence of work of the Geological Survey beginning in 1901 and extending down to 1916 that thereby lay in the Green River Formation, which is located predominantly in northwestern Colorado but extends into Wyoming and Utah, the largest, richest reserve of energy in the world, and it still is the largest, richest reserve of energy in the world, holding according to the record in this case in the aggregate in oil of a richness, in shale of a richness of 30 gallons per ton and a thickness of 15 feet, a grand total of 580 to 600 billion barrels of oil and having in its reserves capable of now being produced with mining and recording and refining methods now available an immediately available reserve, economics to one side, of 80 billion barrels of oil, which is three times the total reserves of the United States approximately, and larger than the total amount of oil that has been consumed in the United States since oil was discovered in 1859 in Titusville, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.970" offset="6991287">The second preliminary matter I should like to bring to your attention is that there is no disputed fact in this case which is not unusual in view of the circumstance that the hearings lasted over five months in Colorado, from June of 1967 until October of 1967, produced a transcript of 5,000 pages and more than 700 exhibits, and I think it is fair to say is one of the most extensive hearings ever held under the mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.510" offset="7129422">Further, it is undisputed that the six claims involved in these proceedings, each of 160 acres, or a total of 960 acres minus a small fraction of a claim that was found not to contain shale, are physical indistinguishable from the 349 acres of oil shale claims that were patented during the forty years from 1920 until 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.219" offset="7232240">It is also conceded, I believe, that there is no other known firmity in these claims if oil shale is a patentable mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.320" offset="7268603">Indeed, inspectors of the department approved all of the claims in this claim for patenting in 1958 and 1960 and all of the formalities have been done, a certificate had issued, had been sent to Washington for the pure ministerial act of issuing the patent when the order came down not to issue any more oil shale patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.259" offset="7360449">Now, before turning, I might here just list the six points that I shall address the Court on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.283" offset="7388453">One, is the nature of the problem that faced the Congress and the Executive Branch when they discovered this; secondly, what they did with the problem, how they solved it; thirdly, the application of the solution over a period of 41 years; fourth, the four principles that the attempt of the Department of the Interior to abolish that solution; fifth, the four independent alternative reasons we advance that prohibit the department from abolishing that solution; and, sixth, the immense benefits to the public that have resulted from the application of that solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.942" offset="7555114">But before doing that, I should like to respond to a point made by my opponent in response to a question from Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.390" offset="7592939">There is in a footnote in the case to which Your Honor referred the statement that there are 500,000 acres that are cluttered up by oil shale claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.086" offset="7631705">There is no basis in the record for that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.190" offset="7648110">The record shows in the transcript at page 3417 and 3744 that in fact in Colorado the government did a very thorough study of all of the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.302" offset="7696593">These claims have to be filed in counties or they lapse within thirty days of discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.459" offset="7717177">They made a very thorough survey of all of the counties in which the preponderant part of the oil shale was located, the Piceance Basin, and their testimony was at that time -- of course that was in 1920 -- that at that time approximately 3.5 percent of those reserves had been patented, approximately 4.5 percent were claimed subject to whatever infirmities the claims might have, so that there was somewhere between 92 and 97 percent of this priceless reserve that is owned today by the government without any claims on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.201" offset="7876211">Now, I come to my first point and that is the problem that faced the Congress and the Executive Branch when they learned that they had this immense treasure on their hands back in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.528" offset="7933471">It is necessary to touch briefly by way of background upon the general land law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.204" offset="7952175">The problem the United States faced in connection with the public land was not how to keep it, the problem was how to get rid of it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fowler Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="2047.622" offset="8293857">But true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.617" offset="8305873">Now, I said that the problem that faced the government in respect to the land laws was not how to keep the land but not how to get rid of it and that facts that show that are quite clear and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.701" offset="8342131">When the Thirteen Colonies got their freedom from Britain, Britain agreed in the Treaty of Paris to give the colonies all of the land that lay between the western borders of the Thirteen Colonies and the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.833" offset="8394689">Maryland would not approve of the constitution because it didn't have any western that boundaries abutted on this land unless the new states agreed to cede it to the federal government which they did, and that doubled the land that the thirteen states had from about 230 million acres up to another 230 million acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.667" offset="8478072">Then when President Jefferson purchased the Louisiana Purchase, that again doubled the area of the United States and three-fourths of that was in the hands of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.326" offset="8528645">And then as we moved west -- the Manifest Destiny, the Mexican Cession, et cetera -- we finally exhausted the 2.5 billion acres of land that constitute the United States and about 2.1 billion acres the federal government has had on its hands, 1.8 billion, and it has been very difficult to get rid of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.992" offset="8603355">It still holds roughly 650 to 700 million acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.678" offset="8622059">First they tried to sell it because Secretary Hamilton and Secretary Gallatin thought it was a wonderful way to pay the debt, so they started pricing it at $10 an acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.066" offset="8655600">The only thing wrong with that was that there were a lot of people in Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York and other large states who had bought a lot of land from their states for about three, four or five cents an acre and they undercut the government price, so they couldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.314" offset="8712652">They tried selling it on credit and nobody paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.295" offset="8720593">They all went bankrupt because they didn't have working capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.997" offset="8731355">So finally they had to go to a policy of free land, which they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.422" offset="8745044">They tried it first in the Homestead Act of 1952, which curiously enough President Buchanan vetoed, but it was finally confirmed in the Homestead Act of 1862, with 160 acres you had yourself a farm and pay $2.50 an acre for it if you lived on it for five years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2187.956" offset="8855176">I will defer to your greater knowledge, but I think it was vetoed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.419" offset="8881089">Now, there was no mining law in effect during this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.154" offset="8891956">When they had the Gold Rush, they were all trespassers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.640" offset="8901883">People made fortunes trespassing on the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.434" offset="8913063">The first mining law came in in 1866 and it provided in general terms that the land should be given away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.901" offset="8942947">It applied only to vein or lode mines, where the miner discovered a vein and then was permitted to follow it as far as it went in the earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.943" offset="8987146">In 1870 it was provided that you could mine placer claims, placer claims being, as you know, detritus or eroded land that has gone down in a stream and then you pan it and get something out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.587" offset="9045765">Both of these -- in 1872 the law was codified, that is the mining law was, and it is very interesting because we have to engage in a way in an act of historical imagination to get ourselves back to where we were in 1872 because that is still the law today and that is the law under which a lot of hard rock miners even as we are sitting here are going out with their burros and hammers and clamoring all over the public land, including the land that is reserved for parks in most cases, trying to find hard rock minerals, gold, silver, lead, et cetera, which haven't been held under this leasing act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.059" offset="9187558">That is the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.186" offset="9196126">The historical imagination parts come in in view of the circumstance that this was just -- this law was passed in 1972, just four years before the Sioux Indians, under Sitting Bull, had their fight with Col. Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.222" offset="9252237">That incidentally was occasioned by the circumstances that -- one of the factors was a mine strike up in the Black Hills and everybody was rushing up there and the whites very callously and senselessly slaughtered the buffalo and deprived the Indians of their food.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.073" offset="9307617">So that is the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.327" offset="9312632">Now, the statute has four very interesting parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.869" offset="9330813">Here it is - Except as otherwise provided, all valuable mineral --"valuable" wasn't in the '66 act, oddly enough -- all valuable mineral deposits in land belonging to the United States, both surveyed and non-surveyed, shall be free and open to exploration and purchase, and the lands in which they are found to occupation and purchase, by citizens of the United States and those who have declared their intention of becoming such, under regulations prescribed by law, and according to the local customs or rules of miners in the several mining districts, so far as the same are applicable -- in other words, Congress adopted the standards of miners, whatever they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.076" offset="9467695">There was no federal government for any practical purposes out in this part of the world, so that in order to maintain peace they simply said we will take over the customs of the miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.151" offset="9499982">Now, there are four aspects of that statute which I think are relevant for our discussion today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.132" offset="9523911">First, it says "valuable," for it says they shall be free, given way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.892" offset="9562990">Next it says that that shall be done under regulations prescribed by law and according to the local customs of miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.043" offset="9595591">Now, the Department of the Interior had occasion to consider that when Secretary Hoke Smith, twice governor of Georgia and several times a Senator was Secretary of the Interior, and he wrote the famous Castle v. Womble case about which you have heard so much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2437.310" offset="9852635">But then it goes on, and this is not quoted "For if as soon as minerals are shown to exist and at any time during exploration before the returns become remunerative, the lands are to be subject to other disposition, few would be found willing to risk time and capital in the attempt to bring to light and make available the mineral wealth which lies concealed in the bowels of the earth as Congress obviously must have intended the explorer should have had proper opportunity to do."</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.745" offset="10022327">Now, it was against that background that Congress and the Executive Branch found themselves facing a very serious problem when this great valuable deposit of oil shale was discovered because it was not hard rock mineral and all of the minerals before that had been hard rock minerals, gold, silver, what have you, except for oil which had been made the subject of a special act in 1897.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.287" offset="10116472">Furthermore, the problem with this mineral wasn't to discover it, everybody knew it was there, the problem was in order to make it profitable to find a way to improve the existing devices so that you could market at a profit in competition with other forms of energy, notably oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.260" offset="10184391">So Congress addressed itself to that problem and tried to see how it could fit this non-metallic energy source into a law devised to take care of hard rock minerals running in veins and found in placers, and the conclusion that they came up with --</text>

            <text syncTime="2571.886" offset="10390967">Sir, it would be analogous, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.379" offset="10416880">The way the Congress and the way the Executive Branch solved the problem, they solved in 1916 when they made the first classification that related to oil shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.070" offset="10471633">In 1897, Congress had given the Department of the Interior the power to make classifications of lands as mineral or non-mineral because the mineral lands took precedence over the agricultural lands because it was felt that it was more desirable to have the minerals developed in view of the small amount of the minerals than it was to have additional farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.020" offset="10547493">So in that classification, what happened was that when the Director of the Geological Survey had to come to grips with this problem of whether or not stuff was a valuable mineral, he found that it was and he wrote a memorandum describing the basis for his reasoning and he wrote it to the Commissioner of the Land Office and here is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.648" offset="10641951">He said, "The net result of oil" -- this was 1916 -- "The net result of oil shale investigations already made is that the oil-shale areas in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming constitute a latent petroleum reserve whose possible yield is several times the estimated total remaining supply of petroleum in the United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.024" offset="10711437">As I mentioned, that is still the case today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.293" offset="10720528">"In view of the high prospective mineral value of lands underlain by oil-shale deposits it is, of course, apparent that they should not be permitted to be acquired under the nonmineral land laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.069" offset="10763682">The lands have not been recommended for withdrawal" -- in those days, as now, the Geodetic Survey, when they classified lands as minerals, they could have withdrawn them from further location, as was done in the case of the minerals when they were made available under the Mineral Leasing Act, including oil shale, but it was decided here -- and this was an exception ordinary practice -- that they would find that they were mineral in character and valuable for mineral, but that they would not withdraw them, and the reasons why he asserts that the department decided not to withdraw them was because the oil-shale industry is not yet developed in the United States, and as it is desired to give opportunity for the establishment of experimental plants, it is believed the lands should remain open for the present to acquisition under the mineral-land laws, even though they are ambiguous and but poorly adapted to deposits of this type -- referring to the hard rock deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.510" offset="10957406">"Accordingly, I hereby classify the tracts listed below as mineral lands, valuable as a source of petroleum and nitrogen, and request that you make the proper notation of the classification upon your records."</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.882" offset="10994918">Now, that brings me to my third point, which is the use that the government and Congress have made of that solution to classify them as minerals and leave them open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.336" offset="11028668">The first use, of course, was when they found the solution and stated it in the language which I have just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.074" offset="11047685">Next, between 1916 and 1920, the record is full of it, they notified Senators, Congressmen, people in the West, newspapers, that this language is valuable, go after it, the price of oil is going up from about $1.20 in 1916 and reaching a high of $3.48 in 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.286" offset="11116544">The war was over, people were concerned about it coming out and thousands of people went out and staked claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.622" offset="11141831">It is all in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.563" offset="11153638">The question of whether or not there should be a patent on these lands had to be faced by the department in 1920, in the same year that the Mineral Leasing Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.523" offset="11193448">Now, the Mineral Leasing Act was passed for the purpose of making available the substances that it covered, petroleum, et cetera, which had been withdrawn as the department had classified these lands as mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.004" offset="11259382">So the purpose of the act was to make available lands that were not available at all theretofore except for oil shale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2819.650" offset="11381948">There was four years of activity about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.903" offset="11390934">The oil shale people went to the Department of the Interior and said, look here, if you put our oil shale into this, which you plan to do, for gosh sakes, leave us some claims, be sure that we've got the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.494" offset="11437328">There were no claims for these other minerals so the exception didn't have to apply to them, so they had had a big meeting at the Department of the Interior, the Department of the Interior said fine, they went down to Congress and said the Department of the Interior and the claimants agree on the statute, they went to Congress, Congress approved it and that was that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.611" offset="11501798">Then the question came up as to whether or not an oil shale should be patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.818" offset="11514650">It was patented the same year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.888" offset="11522905">It was very carefully considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.106" offset="11527816">The lawyers in the Department of the Interior came to the conclusion that they had to patent it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.721" offset="11902307">So they filed the instructions following the original decision based on the last paragraph of Castle v. Womble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.174" offset="11948074">Now I had better turn promptly to my fourth point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.525" offset="11961448">I should mention that in 1960-61, for reasons that nobody knows because there was no hearing, nothing, word went out from Washington to the Department of the Interior, don't issue any more claims on oil shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.005" offset="12007424">There were 18 claims pending, of which those here are two and there are 16 others in another case that has been going on for the same 16 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.602" offset="12041801">The 16 claims, they held them invalid because they hadn't done assessment work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.373" offset="12056848">In these two claims, there have been assessment work, the claims were otherwise perfect so they produced this argument that oil shale was not then and had never been valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.444" offset="12093106">Now, the reasons we say that the law prohibits them from doing that are four.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.469" offset="12129259">In the first place -- and I have tried to outline very sketchily the facts that are supplemented in our brief -- we say that the Congress has not just acquiesced or reacted something like the Internal Revenue Code and overlooked some order where there is some fine print, that the Congress was actively engaged indeed in the oil shale and the Leasing Act expressly provided that oil shale would be -- it is a valuable mineral and subject to patent because I submit that one cannot read that act make any sense out of it unless one agrees that oil shale is a valuable mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.103" offset="12271783">The Congress by its other action at various times as late as 1955, they passed a Multiple Leasing Act which was introduced by Mr. Aspinall who was a Congressman for that part of the world, and the reason for it as the legislative history shows was that the Interior Department had adopted the principle that they would not patent minerals where there was a surface patent outstanding, for example, on a homestead patent where the minerals had been reserved as they were in the case of oil shale prior to 1920, unless the oil shale mineral claimant could get a deed from the surface owner and the surface owner, then the department would grant the patent because it gave you the fee and if you had a farmer that was going to hold you up you had great difficulty getting him to agree to convey to you so he could reconvey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.747" offset="12482330">So they passed this statute to deal expressly with oil shale, called the Multiple Leasing Act, so Interior could now go ahead and grant a patent on the mineral even though a homesteader owns the surface, because ordinarily a patent on a mineral patent takes the surface with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.943" offset="12531127">But if the surface has been pre-patented it couldn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.036" offset="12551502">Now, I will turn to the four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.639" offset="12561951">The first is that Congress has actually endorsed this rule that oil shale is a valuable mineral and so patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.576" offset="12597687">The second is that apart from that, the Department of the Interior in an independent ground has promulgated this rule, has had it in effect since 1920 at the very least in the instructions, that under those circumstances it cannot now in fairness reverse it retroactively, and in that connection I should, if I may, point to the Court's attention that neither one of those two bases for your decision will have the slightest prospective effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.377" offset="12712835">They can only affect oil shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.331" offset="12720671">They can only affect oil shale claims that were located before 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.708" offset="12738226">They can only affect oil shale claims that are proven to be valid to meet all the other tests besides discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.675" offset="12766124">So therefore it is not as though you were being asked to keep an agency from changing a rule prospectively that is going to affect the administration of some important branch of the government, where you are going to bind it to the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.318" offset="12856613">So this has no consequential effect, precedential effect that will in any way impair Interior's administration of the mining laws on the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.229" offset="12896319">And as I have mentioned earlier, the total amount of claims that are available are only about equal to what they have already patented out of a total of 16,000 acres in this great formation, so that it will have no consequential economic effect that will be adverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.464" offset="12961207">Thirdly, I come to the point -- which I take it that already our position is clear -- that indeed this was a valuable mineral, that it was decided the only rational way they could have decided it was to say oil shale was a valuable mineral, and perhaps, if I may say so, the soundness of that position is illustrated by the circumstance that if this Court should hold that oil shale is not a valuable mineral, it will nullify 200,000 acres of reservations of oil shale that underlie homesteads where the Interior Department has granted the homestead and reserved the oil shale, but if oil shale is not a valuable mineral that reservation is invalid and therefore the farmers and the ranchers will pick up the oil shale which will be roughly about the amount of oil shale that is still being claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.592" offset="13153782">Finally, we come to the estoppel argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.853" offset="13166738">Our position on estoppel is, of course, the Court has never said the government could be estopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.195" offset="13184188">It has come up to the brink and looked at it as in the Moser case but it has not decided it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.343" offset="13204773">The Ninth Circuit has taken the view that the government may be estopped.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.340" offset="13416782">They fall into cases where someone has acted outside the scope, some government agency has acted outside the scope of the authority that is given to it and here obviously we have the Secretary involved acting within the scope of his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.067" offset="13463594">Two, where the estoppel is sought to achieve a result that has been expressly prohibited by statute, of course, we take the 180-degree position on that, but here statutes are on our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.763" offset="13514376">Three, we take the position, of course, that the estoppel turns on its own facts and would argue that with the extension of government into the affairs of the citizens far beyond that contemplated, that estoppel in a gross case of a responsible government agency, top government official such as a Secretary, acting within the scope of his authority even though, as we argue, acting incorrectly, that estoppel is proper but that is a question of policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.932" offset="13707055">It doesn't just affect the parties in the case but it is a matter that affects the way the society operates and what the rule of law means as distinguished from what is equitable in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.738" offset="13746343">It seems to me that from the legal and perhaps the philosophical standpoint it is quite one thing for the Judicial Branch to say you must not be capricious in general, you must not come and go and change rules, people must be entitled to know what the law is as against saying in a particular case -- in this case, the conduct is so unfair, to use the language of the Moser case, so unfair and gross as in this case, where it has been relied on for years and millions of dollars have been spent, in the case of this particular party you may not do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3537.178" offset="14252074">I would like to say first that there are an estimated five million acres which I have gotten from the Department of the Interior, is based on an extrapolation from the study that is in the record which relates to only the county in the area in Colorado, and that extrapolation then would take in the other counties in Colorado and the areas in Wyoming and Utah which were not included in this study of court house filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.834" offset="14362728">So it is an extrapolation from that study on which we base an estimate not in the record of five million acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.748" offset="14390314">The difference between what is a valuable mineral resource for purposes of classification and what is a valuable mineral deposit within the meaning of the mining laws for purposes of giving someone a right to relinquishment of federal title to the lands is explained in detail by the Board of Appeals in Footnote 59 of its opinion starting on page 115a of the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.685" offset="14518105">We don't believe that classification has anything to do with the problem in this case because, as this Court's opinion that I quoted to you, the 1905 opinion earlier held that land can be chiefly valuable for its mineral resources and still not qualify under the mining law as a valuable mineral deposit subject to current exploitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.828" offset="14614653">The other authorities to the same effect are collected on page 21 of our brief, including in the footnote there an 1891 decision of this Court which we quote, stating that the existence of the mineral must be in such quantities as would justify expenditure and the effort to obtain it established as a present fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.988" offset="14711306">The standard under mining law was well established even before the 1905 decision to which I called the Court's attention because of the fact that the rationale of Freeman v. Summers was so contrary to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.770" offset="14770448">I would like to say a word about the estoppel question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.472" offset="14781210">The Court has never held the United States to be estopped by the acts of its agents and certainly in accordance with the cases that have been decided, the poorest context in which to start would be on a question of alienation of the lands in a manner not authorized by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.723" offset="14858219">The claims involved here were described, the kinds of claims involved here were described by this Court in Best v. Humboldt Mining as a unique form of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.114" offset="14903777">They are conditional on annual assessment work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.269" offset="14920495">They are defeasible if the mineral resource ceases to be a valuable mineral deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.228" offset="14948289">Their validity is not administratively reviewed in any way until a patent application is filed with the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.206" offset="14984234">Indeed, the claim needn't even specify what mineral it is that has been discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.607" offset="15009834">And Congress, by providing a six-year limitation period after the issuance of the patent for contesting the validity of the patent, has specified the only way in which the United States will be estopped by administrative error under the mining laws which would have the effect of alienating the public lands to private interests in a manner not authorized by the mining laws, are not authorized by Congress itself, and I believe shows in detail why none of the other traditional tests for estoppel would apply here in any event.</text>
