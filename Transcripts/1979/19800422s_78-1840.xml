            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="7.901" offset="31556">This is an appeal from the decision of a three-judge District Court for the District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.403" offset="61544">At issue is the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and its applicability to electoral changes and annexations made by the City of Rome, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.626" offset="118491">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we uphold the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act and also hold that the District Court properly applied the Act to the City of Rome's electoral changes and annexations.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.921" offset="183589">In 1966, the City fundamentally altered its electoral scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.690" offset="210756">The most important modification involved the requirement, that Commissioners in Board Education members would henceforth be elected concurrently by a majority of the at-large votes, not by a plurality.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.015" offset="275958">There is no candidate for a particular position received a majority of the vote, a runoff election would be held between the two candidates who have received the largest number of votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.397" offset="325486">Provision for numbered posts and staggered terms were also adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.223" offset="348891">In addition, the City made 60 annexations between November 1, 1964 and February 10 of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.497" offset="389956">The State of Georgia is a jurisdiction covered by the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.768" offset="411063">Section 5 of that Act requires that the City's electoral changes and annexations be precleared either by the Attorney General of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.264" offset="476996">Preclearance is authorized only if the electoral change or annexation "does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color."</text>
            <text syncTime="136.891" offset="547527">The Attorney General refused to preclear the electoral changes and some of the annexations.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.110" offset="576366">The City then filed this declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia whereupon the three-judge District Court rejected the City's constitutional challenge of the Act and granted summary judgment to the United States finding that the disapproved electoral changes and annexations although not made for indiscriminatory purposes did have a discriminatory effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.975" offset="695798">We affirmed and thereby reject all of the City's procedural and constitutional challenges to the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.417" offset="733623">We hold that the City may not exempt itself from the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.183" offset="748669">The language of the Act in this legislative history plainly indicates that only the State of Georgia and not a political subdivision may bring an action to bail out the Act's -- from under the Act's coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.854" offset="807393">We also hold that the Attorney General's decision to deny preclearance was timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.930" offset="835709">We find no merit in any of the City's constitutional challenge to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.611" offset="854413">First, we note that Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act under the enforcement authority accorded to it by the Fifteenth Amendment, even assuming that Section 1 of that Amendment prohibits only purposeful racial discrimination in voting, the enforcement power of Congress is broad enough to allow it to outlaw voting practice that are discriminatory in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.474" offset="957858">We so held in the 1966 decision in South Carolina versus Katzenbach and we refused to move away from that view that the civil war amendments vested Congress with wide ranging authority to rid our country of racially discriminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.771" offset="1043017">The Civil War Amendments also overwrite any principles of federalism that might otherwise have been an obstacle to adoption of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.434" offset="1085649">Second, we repudiate the City's argument that assuming that the Act was an appropriate exercise of Congressâ€™ congressional power in 1965, it had outlived its usefulness by 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.700" offset="1138730">When Congress extended it for another seven years to the contrary, we uphold Congress' considered determination that at least another seven years of statutory remedies were necessary to counter the perpetuation of 95 years of pervasive voting discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.859" offset="1223367">Third, we find that the Act was not operated to deny the citizens of Rome, their First, Fifth, Ninth or Tenth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.645" offset="1266521">We uphold all of the factual findings of the three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.055" offset="1284180">We agree that the electoral changes from plurality-win to majority-win elections, numbered posts, staggered terms, when combined with the presence of racial bloc voting, Rome's majority white population and at-large electoral system would dilute the Negro vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.152" offset="1368607">We also agree that the City failed to prove that the disapproved annexation would not dilute the voting power of the Negro community in Rome.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.693" offset="1410717">The Voting Rights Act is admittedly a strong medicine but it is strong medicine designed to treat a pernicious condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.548" offset="1450109">As we recognized the South Carolina versus Katzenbach, "Insidious and pervasive evil of racial segregation discrimination in this voting had been perpetuated in certain parts of this country by unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution."</text>
            <text syncTime="383.495" offset="1533910">Today, we affirm our holding in that decision where we stated that the Act is an appropriate means for carrying out Congress' constitutional responsibilities and is consonant with all provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.086" offset="1600261">Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Stevens had filed concurring opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.449" offset="1621786">Mr. Justice Powell has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.076" offset="1636206">And Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Stewart joins.</text>
