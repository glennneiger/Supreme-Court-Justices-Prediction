            <label>Mr. Glenn Zell</label>
            <text syncTime="13.673" offset="158072">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.590" offset="169775">This is certiorari from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals involving a conviction of two -- the two petitioners and two corporations for distribution of obscene materials in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.596" offset="217736">The issues that I will argue this morning involve search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.205" offset="236231">To outline the facts very quickly, the FBI was called to L'Eggs Company, it's a stocking manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.299" offset="268518">They'd received several boxes of films misdirected to them by Greyhound Bus terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.793" offset="298506">Upon opening the boxes by the L'Eggs Company, they discovered they were not stockings, but films, 871 and 25 different specific kinds of films.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.149" offset="352005">They called the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.078" offset="359633">The FBI came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.100" offset="367783">Mr. Mandyk I think his name is, told them to hold it for him, came back in five days and seized the entire shipment, took it to the FBI office.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.376" offset="408848">Thereafter, two months later, he viewed them in the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.538" offset="425566">Approximately two years from the initial seizure, the petitioners went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.617" offset="457853">No notification either by publication or directly, was given the petitioners, no warrant was ever gotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.034" offset="483558">And of course, during the trial, the District Court overruled the motion to suppress based on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.865" offset="510830">The conviction -- the jury found the films obscene, found that petitioner is guilty, appealed to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.745" offset="534340">There was a strong dissent by Judge Wisdom, which laid out our issues very clearly and succinctly and thereafter, we filed a certiorari to this Court.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="115.359" offset="564851">When did the -- did your clients first to learn what the FBI had taken possession of the films?</text>

            <label>Mr. Glenn Zell</label>
            <text syncTime="122.464" offset="593272">Well, Your Honor, in the transcript, it appears that there was some information conveyed by one of the employees, Mr. Grassi to Mr. Sanders about a month or several days or several weeks after the initial seizure or after the FBI seized them.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.579" offset="661713">Just in hearsay, and he said they heard or that was turned over to the FBI, but they weren't sure, there's no date in the record, and it was not verified or didn't know where to go, what to do and he turned over to his lawyer, which, of course, was me, at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.562" offset="741648">We didn't know where they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.821" offset="746663">Mr. -- Mr. Walter testified, he didn't know where they were himself, he wasn't sure, he was never directly told.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.709" offset="766203">(Inaudible) was just told in hearsay that the FBI might have had them.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.597" offset="777801">He -- we never heard anything from the FBI until, of course, the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.479" offset="793266">When the grand jury met, we were notified, and at that time, of course, we filled a motion to return the property.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="177.393" offset="812910">I think that there is no issue as to the obscenity -- the obscene character of some of the films.</text>

            <label>Mr. Glenn Zell</label>
            <text syncTime="184.681" offset="842062">Well, I can see it as a -- a trial attorney that it's a factual disposition to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.846" offset="862751">We litigated the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.053" offset="867558">We presented several expert witnesses, and the jury after being out over a day, found against us on that issue apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.714" offset="894203">So, we did not raise the issue of obscenity in this case, not that we concede or agree with the jury verdict, but we argued it, we fought it, it was a factual determination, and I think that's -- that -- that rest that issue, I think, in this particular case, as far as it goes.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.578" offset="1017710">On the box it said, “We'll call.”</text>
            <text syncTime="231.135" offset="1027950">And there was a clear -- and they hold it at the Greyhound terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.542" offset="1041533">The reason for this is not that they were giving up their right of privacy as the Fifth Circuit alleged or argued, and the District Court found was that they -- in the testimony in the record from Walters and Sanders, that they had repeated shipments being stolen and missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.202" offset="1100152">Apparently, whenever a -- the Greyhound Bus terminal men sees the name of the sender or gets used to it, where it's going at a certain terminal warehouse, apparently, he's broken into and the -- and the shipment is taken or parts are taken out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.579" offset="1153651">It might point out in U.S. versus Kelly, it was the same problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.988" offset="1167339">I think his last seven shipments had been missing or misdirected.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.489" offset="1181341">Apparently, the workers-employees at these common carriers get used to what the shipments are about, and I guess it's -- they've decided just pilfer for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.757" offset="1222405">So because of that problem, we didn't put the name of the sender or the -- who would pick it up the name because we felt the employees would find out about at the common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.309" offset="1260648">And that's been done as -- on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.201" offset="1268172">It had been done before with no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.531" offset="1281546">Many people travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.507" offset="1289383">Movie stars under assumed names, not that they give it the right of privacy, because they want privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.043" offset="1307564">And that's the reason why it was done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1024.059" offset="4199633">What I would like to do at this time is to address a couple of points which I believe should be brought to the Court's attention involving what I ascertain to be mistake -- misstatements of fact contained the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.862" offset="4254804">And one in particular, I think, is incredibly significant down on page 37 and -- and thereafter, wherein is -- it is indicated that the petitioners in this case had decided to return the films to a warehouse for storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.404" offset="4316975">In fact there is nothing in the record to indicate that the purpose of the shipment to Atlanta was for a storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.986" offset="4343306">It could well have been that the purpose of that transportation was in fact, to sell these particular films in Atlanta which as I understand, has the highest per capita homosexual population outside of San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.983" offset="4411329">There are two other points that I like to bring to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.626" offset="4425853">They relate to the film -- films themselves which are 8-millimeter film that are so small, they can -- they cannot be viewed by the naked eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.487" offset="4465351">There is apparent representation to the effect that people at L'Eggs Products Inc. have already ascertained what it was that was on these films when in fact, all they had ascertained was the nature of the box cover which contained a depiction in cartoon fashion of two nude males from the waist up, embracing and -- and kissing and a description purporting to represent, but not necessarily representing what it was that was contained in the films.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.874" offset="4598888">Obviously, the FBI did not believe that this was necessarily what was contained in the films because that was the very reason they screened them was to find out what it was that was contained on these films.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.908" offset="4670986">As it turned out, Your Honor, the -- the films as -- were pretty much as described in the blurb contained on the box covers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.116" offset="4707871">The box covers incidentally were not charged as being obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.301" offset="4724590">Only the films themselves which were later screened about two months subsequent to the time that they were initially taken by the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.320" offset="4768684">What I would like to do is to address rather briefly several points which I feel are significant, which have not been addressed at this point by Mr. Zell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.886" offset="4814869">First of all, I would direct the Court's attention to the scienter issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.353" offset="4836812">Now, there was clearly ample proof provided that my client, Mr. Walter, was engaged in a business which dealt in sexually explicit material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.413" offset="4889057">However, I would suggest to this Court that in accordance with the dictates of Hamlin and Smith, that there has to be some proof of knowledge showing that in fact, he had information of the nature, character and content of the particular films.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.562" offset="4957602">That he knew they were being shipped interstate and that he knew that a common carrier was being used for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.812" offset="4986650">There is nothing other than a silent record to indicate that Mr. Walter was involved in this operation from a point in time, two months prior to this shipment, to a time, two months subsequent to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.516" offset="5049448">The Government has argued that there was evidence showing that he participated directly in the day to day affairs of this particular business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.192" offset="5092185">However, there is no evidence showing that any of these other shipments purportedly made interstate involved obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.122" offset="5123845">And as this Court well knows Roaden versus Kentucky requires the presumption to be made that material not adjudicated to be obscene is to be presumed not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.569" offset="5173687">Hence, the only material properly brought before the Court and the jury in this case involved the films in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.851" offset="5202735">And as far as those films were concerned, there's nothing given any sort of nexus to Mr. Walter and those particular films as far as the element of scienter is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.428" offset="5257070">Turning to the point raised in the brief, in connection with the requirement that the Court instruct in accordance with the dictates of the Pinkus case that, “person” is to mean adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.779" offset="5318510">It need be pointed out that on at least five separate proposed jury instructions, the defendant sought to have that sort of definition be made known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.317" offset="5368665">I think that it's clear to anyone who understands the English language that the word, “person” subsumes the class, “children” and accordingly, the instructions given by the Court were fatally defective for the reasons earlier enunciated in Pinkus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.429" offset="5445047">And the only thing that we can do and this is what the Government would have us do, is to assume that obviously this jury forgot about children, because of the instructions given and only applied the attributes of the average person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.355" offset="5512756">However, an average person includes people of all ages, hence that particular argument is not effective and moreover, to assume that the jury did not follow the directions of the Court and use the standard of the average person, would be to do an injustice to the jury and it's understanding of the Law as given it by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.383" offset="5608887">And moreover, since the jury verdict was a general one, there's no way that we can know that in fact that jury did not do exactly what was forbidden by Pinkus -- that being to include children within the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.652" offset="5665938">While we're talking about jurors, very briefly I would point out that insofar as one of the jurors was involved in this case there is testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.531" offset="5713481">In fact, the record by the trial judge indicates that one of the jurors had to be directed to put away a book or magazine on the only occasion on which he viewed the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.273" offset="5760502">Subsequently, the jury did not see the film again in the jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.940" offset="5779101">The trial judge observed that sufficient attention had been paid by this particular juror in that he observed that juror watching the film on 7 of 10 occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.513" offset="5825390">There were proffers of proof made that members of the press in attendance of this trial would've observed that this particular juror did not watch the film for substantial periods of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1637.139" offset="6651904">On pages 8 and 9 of our brief, we refer to the record wherein we state that about two to three weeks after the transfer of the films from L'Eggs Hosiery Company to the FBI, codefendant Grassi -- Michael Grassi called the L'Eggs Company and discovered that the films had been transferred to FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.983" offset="6747303">The record also shows that Grassi then informed petitioners, Walter and Sanders that the films were in the FBI's possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.508" offset="6777396">Furthermore, I believe petitioner Sanders testified or there was a testimony to the effect that petitioner Sanders informed the -- his employees to destroy any bills of lading or other documents that would connect him or the corporations to these films.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.892" offset="6898918">-- part of the Fourth Amendment argument is that petitioners essentially relinquished or abandoned any reasonable expectation of privacy in the shipment of films.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.994" offset="6943326">But we don't – we don't seek to -- to use their destruction of the bills of lading or other documents to support that because that occurred after the films were transferred to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.883" offset="7002885">Mr. Justice Powell asked whether there was any -- any evidence that petitioners made a conscious decision not to demand the films from the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.159" offset="7039979">Well, there may not be testimony to that effect, but I believe the record of the suppression hearing indicates that petitioner Sander's attorney, Mr. Zell, candidly explained to the District Court that the reason that petitioner did not come forward to claim the films was that he did not want to identify himself to the Government and connect himself with these films.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.956" offset="7135169">So that it seems clear that the failure to request an adversary hearing rests entirely on petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.675" offset="7846118">I'd like to turn now to the suppression issue that -- that's been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.382" offset="7864926">As far as the other issues, we've divided the questions in this case into two general categories for purposes of convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.904" offset="7898990">The first deals with the question whether petitioners may seek suppression of the films because of alleged violations of the Fourth and First Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.961" offset="7939218">And the second category of issues we place within the District Court's conduct of the trial referring to the jury instructions, jury voir dire, the scienter issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.727" offset="7986239">And as to these latter issues we essentially rely on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.175" offset="8004106">We begin with the Fourth Amendment claims that were raised by petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.541" offset="8021556">They argue that the acquisition of the films from L'Eggs and the subsequent inspection of the films by the Government, violated their rights under the Fourth Amendment and require application of the exclusionary rule in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.850" offset="8070771">At the outset, we would like to note that only the individual petitioners here Walter and Sanders may properly raise this issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.662" offset="8114030">As the Court of Appeals noted, the corporate petitioners, that is Trans World America and Gulf Coast News, never moved for suppression of these films from evidence in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.153" offset="8163976">They therefore, waived any right to suppression under Rule 12 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.332" offset="8184665">And we submit that they're foreclosed from raising the suppression issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.724" offset="8214235">At least since this Court's decision in Katz versus United States, the touchstone of the Court's analysis in the Fourth Amendment area has been whether an individual's legitimate expectation of privacy has been invaded by an unreasonable governmental intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.008" offset="8275362">A recurrent theme of our Fourth Amendment analysis in this case is that petitioners Walter and Sanders did not have an expectation of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment with respect to the packages of films.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.481" offset="8329279">What actually occurred here was that petitioners used a common carrier to ship a large quantity of pornographic films across state lines, using fictitious names for both the shipper and the consignee and giving a false address for the shipper and no address for the consignee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.398" offset="8396988">Under these circumstances, we submit, petitioners knew or should have known that the shipment might inadvertently come into the possession of an innocent third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.348" offset="8432724">In this case a legitimate business, the L'Eggs Hosiery Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.083" offset="8447666">It was also foreseeable and petitioners assumed the risk that once L'Eggs inspected the contents of the packages, they would contact law enforcement authorities and on its own and on their own initiative, turn the shipment over to the Government for possible prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.244" offset="8532302">The fact that petitioners may have retained the property interest in these goods, does not affect the Fourth Amendment analysis in this particular case, because we submit, they had no legitimate expectation with risk of privacy with respect to the films.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.494" offset="8605341">Now, it may be that if petitioners had chosen to possess these films at home and to view them, they would be protected from --</text>
