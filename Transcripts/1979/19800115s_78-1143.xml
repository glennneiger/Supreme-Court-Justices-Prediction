            <text syncTime="10.187" offset="40647">The Immigration and Nationality Act provides about a person who is a national of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.586" offset="70322">He will lose his nationality if he takes a note of allegiance to a foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.843" offset="91324">The Act also provides that proof shall be by a preponderance of the evidence and that the voluntariness of the oath shall be resumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.348" offset="125388">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that citizenship could not be lost absent proof of an intent to surrender it.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.092" offset="160287">It also invalidated the standard of proof and the presumption as beyond the power of Congress to prescribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.605" offset="202397">We noted probable jurisdiction of the Government's appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.169" offset="224653">We agree with the Court of Appeals that proof of an intent to surrender citizenship is necessary if citizenship is to be lost under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.482" offset="277838">We disagree with the Court of Appeals however, with respect to the standard of proof and the presumption of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.240" offset="308872">We think that those provisions are within the power of Congress to prescribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.170" offset="340637">We accordingly reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.584" offset="362266">Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Stevens have each filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
