            <text syncTime="38.226" offset="256293">The issue here today is the meaning of a sentence in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, section 706(e), and the particular phrase with which this case is concerned is that which states that in a deferral state a charge shall be filed on behalf of the person aggrieved within 300 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.219" offset="424208">We are told that there are three possible interpretations the 300 days may not mean 300 days that it may mean 240 days, although 240 days does not appear in the statute or that it may mean 180 days, which would require a rewriting of the statute or complete amendment of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.458" offset="637158">Yes, he began to believe retroactively that his employment in total was part of a scheme to create a fiction of compliance with anti-discrimination statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.641" offset="701942">He then sought to obtain a remedy for what he perceived to be discriminatory treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.041" offset="755545">He inquired of EEOC in Buffalo, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.722" offset="774248">He was told that he had 300 days within which to file with the Buffalo office.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.171" offset="808103">Having been told that, he was told something which was the consistent policy of EEOC since 1968 that is, in the deferral state, to give the larger time provided by section 706(e) or by its predecessor which had permitted only 210 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.473" offset="909249">Had he called New York State Division of Human Rights, he would have been told he had one year within which to file with that agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.106" offset="967764">Mr. Silver filed with the EEOC within 291 days of his termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.592" offset="997752">EEOC deemed his filing to have been timely, deferred to the state agency in accordance with another provision of section 706, that is 706(c), permitted the state agency to act upon the charge, resumed the processing of it at a later date, more than 60 days later, and ultimately issued to Mr. Silver the right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.411" offset="1141008">The company, without reaching the merits, defended on the ground that the charge with EEOC had been untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.868" offset="1186879">The varying decisions of the District Court and of the majority and of the minority in the Circuit Court show that, although we are told that the language is plain, is certainly seems to be confusing enough since with all of the attention given to it, there were three separate views of what 300 days meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.306" offset="1300564">The majority of the Circuit Court said 300 days means 300 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.148" offset="1319999">The minority in the Circuit Court said it does not, it means 180 days the District Court having found that it really meant 240 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.798" offset="1570565">In 1972 or preceding the 1972 amendments, there was the proposal, a Senate bill, which would have changed 706(c) so that the language "no charge may be filed" would have been altered to read "the commission shall take no action.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.302" offset="1672547">"Now, clearly 706(c) is directed at the commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.846" offset="1722807">706(c) was the subject of discussion and the intended modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.278" offset="1752482">The modification was deemed unnecessary because Congress then had read "no charge may be filed in a way" consistent with "the commission shall take no action."</text>

            <text syncTime="733.391" offset="3036975">At the time that Title VII was enacted in 1964 by express provision, EEOC was given power from time to time to adopt regulations to create procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="768.184" offset="3176155">There was no effort made to modify, rather than by referring to Love there was a tacit endorsement of what EEOC had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.033" offset="3235506">Before I leave the legislative history, I think it is very important to state that when this statute was enacted in 1964, there was a compromise and this is much written about in all of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.972" offset="3299244">There certainly was a compromise between those who wanted a Civil Rights Act and those who did not, and there was a compromise between those who wanted to leave all power to deal with discrimination in employment in the hands of the states or the localities.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.993" offset="3371342">While there was a compromise, there was no abdication.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.543" offset="3393494">There was a very express development of a statutory provision that guaranteed deferral to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.431" offset="3437066">That was a primary concern and the primary ingredient of that compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.324" offset="3456711">It remains intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.594" offset="3465697">There is no question but that EEOC and its processes in this case and others have permitted the state and the local agencies to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.174" offset="3516061">By 1972, Congress had learned a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.780" offset="3538526">In the first instance, it had not spent too much time or effort in developing procedures in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.470" offset="3569246">It was concerned about very broad strokes about basic policy kinds of pronouncements.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.282" offset="3600488">It left very largely to EEOC and to the courts the development of the procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.444" offset="3633194">By 1972, it was a different time and a different place and Congress had a different approach to the problem of dealing with discrimination in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.589" offset="3693693">It recognized again, as the courts had done in the developmental period, that this was a statute largely used by laymen, it was a statute which could not be hypertechnically applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.800" offset="3770598">Congress also recognized that its hope and plan for conciliation as the primary method of disposition of employment discrimination appeared to be less likely to be fulfilled and emphasized more and more the need for litigation and more and more to remove barriers rather than to create them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1482.748" offset="6034369">So the deferral period limits in a sense the commission's control of its own docket, it cannot enter a case onto its investigate rolls until the deferral period is over.But that controls what the commission can do, so the commission is not going to intrude on what Congress believed should be handled by the states in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.604" offset="6121827">But it doesn't follow from that that the aggrieved person should be thought not to have satisfied his filing requirements within the statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.010" offset="6163414">So I think it is in that sense that Congress understood Love, as upholding the right of the commission to received, the mere image of the commission's receiving is that the individual has filed his charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.033" offset="6559535">I'm not suggesting that Congress believed that delay should be excused in some situations rather than in another, but Congress must surely have been aware of the varying procedures and limitations and substantive laws of the various states, and Congress did not attempt to finely tune section 706 so that there would be a perfect matching of federal jurisdiction and state jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.377" offset="6660890">It was addressing the generality of state statutes and in doing so it decided that 300 days or some additional period of time was appropriate to allow a person to resort to state proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.997" offset="6719404">It is not uncommon in an analogous area, for example, if there is a federal statute that is silent on a statute of limitations for this Court to borrow the appropriate state statute of limitations as controlling a federal action because of the deference to the states where there would be no countervailing federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.867" offset="6814804">Here there is on the very face of the act a policy of deferral to the states and there doesn't seem to be any federal interest to be served in requiring a person to file within 180 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.046" offset="7043532">The phrase "initially instituted" I think ties in with subsection 706(c) which is that the person must commence his state proceedings, either directly himself or by the EEOC's referral of the charge to the state on his behalf within that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.805" offset="7118555">Of course, under the EEOC regulations, that will automatically happen, even on the 300th day, because the EEOC's regulations require the commission to forward a charge to the state if the aggrieved person has not done so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.766" offset="7238405">Now, the purpose of the limitations period in section 706 was identified by the Court in the Occidental Life Insurance case, that a statute of limitation is intended to put the respondent to an EEOC charge on notice that a charge has been filed to allow him to prepare, to retain records to prepare for a possible lawsuit, a conciliation settlement or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.316" offset="7348642">But even under petitioner's construction of the act as, for instances, requiring the filing within 180 days, nothing in section 706 requires that the employer receive any notice of the charge filed with the state within 180 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.366" offset="7412799">For instance, 706 requires deferral to a state if the appropriate state law is a criminal proceeding, and it would be unusual that a state would promptly notify a possible target of the criminal investigation that he is under criminal investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.405" offset="7481031">So the one purpose that can be identified with a federal limitations period would not necessarily be served under petitioner's construction of the law because there would be no guarantee that the employer would receive the notice at that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.266" offset="7548426">But in our construction of section 706(e), as soon as the commission does receive the charge the commission would be required to promptly notify within 10 days the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.903" offset="7611016">So the 300-day limitation period that Congress has set on the outside as an outside limit for filing a federal charge would insure that prompt notification of the employer.</text>
