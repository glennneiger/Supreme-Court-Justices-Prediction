            <text syncTime="58.819" offset="338631">-- you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="willard_z_carr_jr" startTime="59.347" stopTime="475.739">
            <label>Mr. Willard Z. Carr, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="59.347" offset="340720">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.752" offset="350333">Question which is before the Court in this case is whether the requirement that there'd be 45 weeks of work within a calendar year in order to achieve the status of a permanent employee, the California brewing industry, whether this is a seniority system or a part of a seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.009" offset="427447">The Ninth Circuit found that it was an all or nothing proposition and that didn't -- did not meet the fundamental test with seniority system which they said had to be based upon length of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.954" offset="479169">It is our position that from an examination of the system itself, it not only looks like a seniority system, it operates as a seniority system, and it is a seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.132" offset="539878">California brewing industry, at the time this complaint was filed, operated under a multiemployer agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.426" offset="577076">There are a number of unions involved under this agreement too.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.200" offset="596198">Within the particular classification of brewer which is the classification of Mr. Bryant, the plaintiff in this case held, there were three tiers of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.572" offset="641651">There were new employees, there were temporary employees, and there were permanent employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.321" offset="668609">A new employee was an employee who work 60 days within a calendar year in order to become a temporary employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.379" offset="696926">A temporary employee was an employee who worked within 45 weeks within a calendar year in order to become a permanent employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.136" offset="735901">Throughout the time, from the day that the employee first comes to the industry and starts working in the industry, starts acquiring seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.247" offset="772368">He acquires seniority on two different bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.465" offset="785220">He acquires seniority on the plant basis and he also inquires seniority on an industry basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.465" offset="813223">This seniority has different applications for different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.408" offset="829001">But for each day that the employee work, he is building up seniority credit towards various purposes under the Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.458" offset="861184">For example, after the employee has worked 30 days, he is no longer a probationary employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.107" offset="883754">After he's worked 30 days, he cannot be discharged except for just cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.831" offset="902666">After he has worked 60 days within a calendar year, then he becomes a temporary employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.763" offset="926386">Now, when he's a new employee as he's working along this way, he is building up plant seniority as a new employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.072" offset="951672">He's also building up industry seniority as a new employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.986" offset="971316">Among other new employees, he has seniority rights within the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.467" offset="989288">He would be laid off after other -- after other new employees were laid off who were junior to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.978" offset="1011336">And within the industry, he would have also rights as a new employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.755" offset="1026382">When he becomes a temporary employee, he then has further rights as a temporary employee on the basis of his work within the particular plant and also as a temporary employee based upon his work within the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.684" offset="1086151">If a temporary employee is going to be laid off, he is going to be laid off based upon his seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.585" offset="1109661">The junior temporary employee working in that plant would be the first person laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.577" offset="1129723">The senior temporary employee will be the last laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.584" offset="1141739">If an employee is going to be recalled to work within that plant and they have a need for temporary employees, then the temporary employee with the greatest seniority within that plant will be the first to be recalled and the temporary employee with the least seniority within that plant will be the last recalled.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.971" offset="1211225">The same situation pertains to permanent employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.579" offset="1225644">Within the classification of permanent employees, it is the permanent brewers that we're talking about, Your Honor, within the classification of permanent employees, employees are laid off according to their seniority as permanent employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.848" offset="1274755">The most senior permanent employee is laid off last, the most junior employee -- permanent employee is laid off first.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.498" offset="1305370">On a question of recall, and this is again on the basis of plant seniority, the permanent employee with the greatest seniority would be recalled first and the plant employee or the permanent employee with the least seniority would be the -- recalled last.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.831" offset="1362735">This is the way it works on a plant by plant basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.785" offset="1378513">In addition to this, our industry applications of the seniority principle -- for example, the temporary employee and I might pause here for a second to point out that the term “temporary employee” maybe a misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.137" offset="1427937">It's a term that is used in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.483" offset="1437341">These are not temporary employees in the sense that they're casual employees, these and temporary employees maybe employees who have worked for a period of years within the industry and have acquired important and significant rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.162" offset="1488018">The temporary employee on the basis of this industry service, he may work for one company, for two companies, for three companies, will acquire rights and will work -- work towards acquiring the 45 weeks of work within the calendar year which will enable him to become a permanent employee.This is an application of industry seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.146" offset="1571924">Also, there's another application of industry seniority as far as temporary employees are concerned.If a temporary employee is out of work, he's been laid off by his own employer and all the temporary employees with plant seniority at another plant have been recalled and they still need for additional temporary employees of that plant, the plant employee or the temporary employee with the greatest industry seniority will be the first person recalled to that plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.229" offset="1680280">So this is another application of the seniority principle working within the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.941" offset="1711104">And the employees also are acquiring in other rights in addition to the competitive rights of seniority which I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.631" offset="1733883">They're also acquiring benefit rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.410" offset="1745063">They're acquiring rights as far as health and wealth are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.637" offset="1757915">They're acquiring rights as far as pensions are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.040" offset="1767528">They're acquiring rights as far as vacations are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.095" offset="1779754">These rights are building up within this multitiered system as the employees progress through the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.397" offset="1809011">Now, when the system comes to the point where the employee is working, say less than 45 weeks, the temporary employee is working less than 45 weeks within the calendar year, and so therefore, he does not become a permanent employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.533" offset="1877556">The Ninth Circuit suggested or claimed that this was an all or nothing proposition, and that he had to start over again on January 1 of the following year and earn the 45 weeks of work within that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.597" offset="1929801">In our opinion, this was a failure on the part of the Ninth Circuit to examine the system as a whole as this Court has said on numerous occasions, seniority systems are quite varied in their application in the varieties that they have and that there's no one system is -- note 41 in Teamsters says, “No one system is to be preferred.”</text>

            <text syncTime="585.997" offset="2447339">But that I think it's very unlikely hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.176" offset="2460087">This case is before this Court without any evidence as to the operation, the maintenance of the system or how it actually operates, is conceivable under the language of the Agreement that this can work.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.145" offset="2503973">However, I think it is highly unlikely that an employee would find himself in that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.203" offset="2524139">There's only two reasons that an employee, under the situation that you posit could be a disadvantage to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.872" offset="2554859">And that would be, number one, if he is working for a company which has economic problems, economic downturns, and so therefore they are laying off employees and they're not the job opportunities at that plant, that's one fortuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.202" offset="2608149">The other fortuity would be if the employee himself was not available, if he was on leave of absence, if he was sick, if he was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.455" offset="2637197">But each day that an employee works under the system within the industry and within the plant, he is acquiring seniority rights which, with reasonable certainty, will assure him of the best opportunity, the best chance of becoming a permanent employee the following year.</text>

            <text syncTime="944.790" offset="3882506">It's common.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.495" offset="3885328">There's also some other cases that had been cited in the brief and in the AFL-CIO brief, they included in their appendix a example in the Seafarers Union where this type of a program exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.142" offset="3935901">One of the cases cited in our brief, the New Jersey Brewing Company involved a situation where employees had to work on a similar basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.904" offset="3971009">Gerber Foods involved a situation where the War Labor Board directed that the provision be that there'd be 600 hours within a six-month period which is quite similar to what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.708" offset="4018239">So there is a considerable precedent for this type of system in this operation of a system along this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.687" offset="4050108">As the Chief Justice said in a case decided a few years ago when he was a judge in Outland, that very short term is length of service being considered the dominant factor and that is contrary to experience and also to judicial attitudes to say that it is a dominant factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.818" offset="4122624">In this case, we do have a major of time work and whether it'd be within a discrete period of time as in 45 weeks within a calendar year, it is still a period of time work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.655" offset="4165987">It is not running to any of devises that might be considered in other types of cases if you're dealing with the supervisor's evaluation or an educational test or something like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.286" offset="4220531">It is a major of time work and it operates just on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.282" offset="4236518">Our position as far as the disposition of this case, the disposition that this Court should make this case is first, that it should be remanded to the District Court for Mr. Bryant to have the opportunity to prove any allegations of intentional or differential treatment that he maybe able to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.354" offset="4316766">Secondly, if there's some question in the Court's mind or in the party's mind as to whether this is a bona fide system which was specifically not addressed by the Ninth Circuit, then it should be remanded to have a determination made and evidence taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.495" offset="4373400">One of the problems with this case is that this case is before you without a record as to the actual operation or without any evidence as to whether there's any question of the bona fides of this particular case -- particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.757" offset="4434422">Finally, we think that this Court can and should decide that this particular provision based upon an examination of the totality of the seniority system within the California brewing system, how it works on a plant basis, how it works on an individual company basis that it must be held to be a seniority system and therefore within exemption, 703 (h) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.914" offset="5131055">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.220" offset="5152266">There are a number of facts in this record, some of which have been touched on by Mr. Carr in behalf of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.587" offset="5181733">It cannot be disputed and that are R and R few determinative of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.006" offset="5211408">One of these facts is that the 45-week rule is based on time served, it is based on service.In determining whether that rule reflects the seniority principle, therefore, it becomes necessary to determine to find out under the system how in a -- a temporary employee's chances of working 45 weeks in a calendar year are allocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.663" offset="5342020">As Mr. Carr has indicated, the competition for work opportunities among temporary employees is determined by plant and industry seniority that accrues from year to year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.677" offset="5406072">It is this accrual interaction of seniority that affords the employee the opportunity to work 45 weeks in a calendar year, and therefore, satisfied the requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.887" offset="5478902">So viewed against the context of the total seniority system, it seems the time that the 45-week rule in the acquisition of permanent status reflects seniority principles to the fullest possible degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.765" offset="5562389">One of the functions of the 45-week rule is to regulate competition between so-called permanent employees and temporary employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.490" offset="5613380">It is the way, in other words, that industry service is given partial seniority credit at the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.767" offset="5646399">Whereas the Government says at page 24 of its brief, “It is a measure of time worked.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.915" offset="5683075">And like other measures of seniority, the 45-week rule is to a great extent determinative of where an employee appears on the seniority list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.734" offset="5742320">And Mr. Bryant has always agreed that the brewery system should extend recognition to length of industry service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.665" offset="5778056">That appears at page 306 and 307 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.623" offset="5797909">But neither he nor the Government likes the 45-week rule because it does not give controlling effect to what they describe as cumulative length of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.492" offset="5853288">We submit that in seeking to restrict Section 703 (h) to cumulative length of service systems, our opponents apparently confuse simple longevity with seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.938" offset="5919117">Longevity is only one of the values that are reflected in seniority arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.382" offset="5956942">If it were the only value, if it were the only value, all seniority systems would allocate opportunities across the broadest possible basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.622" offset="5993827">There would be no collective bargaining agreement establishing separate units of seniority as appeared in the system considered by this Court in Teamsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.363" offset="6044818">There would be no agreements having rules providing for the breaks in seniority or for loss of accrued seniority altogether as can be found in virtually every collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.686" offset="9478144">They are a part of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.149" offset="9487966">They do not concern the countervailing considerations that the employers generally have introduced to erode the notion of seniority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2857.023" offset="11531473">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.568" offset="11545684">As the United States views the governing legal principles in this case, the broader propositions urged by the employers and the unions here proved too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.305" offset="11600541">Seniority in the sense of length of service is ordinarily a substantial ingredient in transfers, promotions, layoffs, rehirings and in measuring compensation and fringe benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.849" offset="11678804">This cannot mean, we submit, that all additional criteria considered along with seniority for such purposes thereby become part of the seniority system within the meaning of Section 703 (h) and thereby become immunized from examination under the ordinary standards of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.089" offset="11783711">Otherwise, the limited purpose exception of 703 (h) would largely swallow up Title VII's guarantee of non-discrimination in transfers, promotions, layoffs, rehiring, and in compensation and fringed benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.608" offset="11857795">So our major premise in this case is that a rule such as the 45-week rule that at issue here, must be separately scrutinized for purposes of Section 703 (h) to determine whether it embodies the seniority principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.028" offset="11943476">Another way of stating the same proposition is that we don't believe the use of the word system in Section 703 (h) is meant to be a grab bag for non-seniority considerations that can be tied in with seniority considerations and thereby immunized from the basic non-discrimination principle of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.324" offset="12052668">If anything, we would submit that it would be more plausible to read the word system in 703 (h) as indicating the way in which seniority can be used to override the non-discrimination principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.526" offset="12137514">It's only systematic use rather than ad hoc use of seniority which is being authorized to override the basic purpose of the statute, the non-discrimination principle so that there will be a guarantee that to the extent seniority will override the basic principle of the statute, it will be systematic seniority available to all classes of persons rather than ad hoc use of seniority that might prejudice the protected classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.700" offset="12274186">Now, our minor premise in this case, it seems that that's fundamentally important question before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.579" offset="12305638">Our minor premise is that the 45-week rule at issue here does not embody the seniority principle as we understand it because it does not provide reasonable certainty of progression based principally on cumulative length of satisfactory and reasonably continuous service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.864" offset="12426846">This does not mean that the rule is invalid but only in our submission that it is not immunized by Section 703 (h) from a challenge under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.976" offset="12483271">And the legal standard I have stated is a rather complex one involving cumulative length of satisfactory and reasonably continuous service and reasonable certainty of progression.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.312" offset="12604583">It seems to me the complexities of seniority rules largely go to determining these various elements that I'm stating rather than to incorporating in other considerations and other values that don't go to effectuating the basic principle of seniority which is what Congress meant to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.111" offset="12707819">And their discussion was largely in terms of last hired, first fired kind of relatively simple considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.459" offset="12765184">It seems to us that this is the approach to 703 (h) that is faithful to the basic purpose of Title VII which was to assure that there would be a non-discrimination principle applicable to work rules affecting all these valuable rights in the employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.358" offset="12860792">And our view of what constitutes seniority for these purposes is supported as well by this Court's decisions by analogy, considering what constitutes seniority for purposes of veterans' reemployment rights under the Military Selective Service Act.[Laughs]</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.700" offset="12970193">As we explain in some detail in our brief on pages 8 and 9 and in footnote 7, one of the reasons we think this 45-week rule does not meet the legal standard for purposes of 703 (h) is because of the fortuities that it permits to displace cumulative length of service as determinative of achieving the permanent status that's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.357" offset="13092760">But even if, in our view, even if it produce results that more closely approximated cumulative length of service, it still seems to us would not be a rule that's part of a seniority system because of the lack of reasonable certainty of progression which was the basic reason why in the McCarthy case, cited and discussing our brief, this Court held that a veteran was not entitled to a promotion that he could not be reasonably certain of having received during the period of his military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.514" offset="13257435">That after all is an act in which seniority of being an emulative principle should be broadly interpreted where here, it's an exception that should be narrowly interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.020" offset="13303411">Instead, what we have is a classification system which -- as Mr. Wolpman has explained, has something about us and them syndrome in which there is no reasonably certain progression from the class of them to the class of us that can be earned through stages of seniority, through which there is some kind of systematic progression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.229" offset="13408319">Now, it maybe that in this industry, these classifications are justified by the business needs of the particular industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.871" offset="13454817">And we don't say that in determining whether the business justification has been met under Title VII, there is no room for flexibility in the collective bargaining process.</text>
