            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 78-630, State of Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.050" offset="151594">Mr. Attorney General, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="21.375" stopTime="526.085">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="21.375" offset="188897">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.832" offset="206660">The State of Washington has for a number of years imposed a tax of 16 cents per pack on the sale or possession of cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.253" offset="248351">Income from that tax supports a broad range of state programs, services and institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.202" offset="276146">The state's general sales tax of 5 percent is also levied against cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.680" offset="302059">Neither tax is applied to sales by Indians to other Indians on the reservation to which both belong.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.436" offset="337168">The respondent tribes recently have gone into the cigarette business.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.981" offset="355244">In connection with that business, the tribes levy what they call a tax or an administrative fee on cigarette sales on their reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.618" offset="393801">That fee is far smaller than the state's tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.783" offset="410520">Their claim in this litigation is that their entry into the cigarette business together with their tax or fee exempts Washington citizens from the state's cigarette and general sales taxes for on-reservation purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.693" offset="474154">A divided District Court found that the state's pre-existing tax was preempted by the tribal taxes and fees and alternatively that the state tax interfered with tribal self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.685" offset="522115">We appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.311" offset="532668">The scheme adopted by the tribes as upheld by the District Court has several interrelated consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.896" offset="566941">The tribes emphasize only one of these consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.909" offset="583032">Because their taxes or fees are 13 to 16 cents per pack lower than the state taxes, the tribes sell large quantities of cigarettes to non-Indians who are willing to drive considerable distances to save that differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.021" offset="647502">As a result, the tribes' revenues are substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.714" offset="666206">Not mentioned by the tribes, however, is the fact that the state loses about $4 from its tax revenues for every $1 which is secured by the tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.337" offset="716675">Incidentally, the total loss in state revenues as a result of all Indian smoke shops now is about $13 million per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.332" offset="752724">Inevitably, that consequence adversely affects the ability of the state to supply governmental and social services to its citizens, Indian and non-Indian alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.315" offset="800684">The fact that the bulk of that $3 difference between state losses and tribal receipts remains in the pockets of non-Indian purchasers cannot be overemphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.941" offset="847182">It illustrates the fact that this case concerns the asserted right of an Indian tribe to market their major tax exemption to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.797" offset="886575">Those non-Indians avoid taxes which their fellow citizens, who are either more principled or live farther from reservation smoke shops, must pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.828" offset="930670">The state tax is thus rendered inequitable and view it as a revenue sharing method.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.366" offset="956792">The entire method is absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.808" offset="970585">In this presentation, I propose first to deal with the preemption issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.262" offset="992423">I will show that no valid source may be identified to support the claim that the tribes can preempt or that the United States has preempted these state taxes, then I will demonstrate that the concept of tribal self-government does not and cannot by the imposition of these same taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.734" offset="1074343">As an introduction to our argument against preemption, it may help to point out that the word "preemption" is used in your decisions as well as in this argument to describe two closely related but distinct concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.187" offset="1144142">First, the United States may preempt the state tax by adopting its own comprehensive taxing or regulatory statutes, thus occupying the field as it did in the situation in Warren Trading Post.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.730" offset="1206314">Second, it may also preempt the state without occupying the field simply by prohibiting the state's entry, as you found it did in the McClanahan situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.202" offset="1260231">Now, except during the heyday of the federal instrumentality doctrine, this Court simply has not found a state tax on non-Indians with respect to their on-reservation activities to be preempted unless that preemption is found in a statute or a treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.575" offset="1337657">And in Mescalero quite recently this Court declined to revive the federal instrumentality doctrine as a bar even to a state's direct taxation of a tribal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.980" offset="1391261">Eighty years ago, in Thomas v. Gay, this Court unequivocally held that the Indian Commerce Clause of the Constitution standing alone did not preempt state or local taxation of non-Indian property on an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.660" offset="1462000">You have consistently required a showing of a preemptive statute or treaty before striking down a state tax on the on-reservation activities of non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.588" offset="1513723">And the only statute you have ever found to have that effect was the Indians Trader Act and the circumstances of the Warren Trading Post case.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.923" offset="1555101">That statute you found to be so detailed and comprehensive as to preempt Arizona's levy of a gross receipts tax on a non-Indian holding a federal license to trade with the Navajos in respect to his income from Indians on their reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.618" offset="1625840">Less all-encompassing statutes and treaty provisions, on the other hand, simply do not preempt state taxes on non-Indians doing business on reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.470" offset="1669204">Almost a century ago, in Utah and Northern Railway Company, when this Court could find neither a treaty nor a statutory bar to a territory's taxation of an on-reservation railroad, it upheld the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.748" offset="1730330">Again, in Thomas v. Gay, you found no treaty or statutory bar to a local tax on non-Indian cattle grazing on reservation land leased from the tribes with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, even though the tribal leases were granted under express statutory authority from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.526" offset="1821445">And finally, three years ago, in Moe, you upheld a state cigarette tax on non-Indian purchasers from an Indian smoke shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.929" offset="1859062">That smoke shop was located on land leased from the tribe, a tribe also controlled the shop's purchases of cigarettes and charged the operator an administrative fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.592" offset="1905768">Nevertheless, you found no treaty or statutory provision to preempt the state tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.760" offset="1934399">To return for a third time to the decision in Thomas v. Gay, the taxpayer asserted there that the tax might destroy the value of the Indian lands for leasing purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.149" offset="1988002">This Court found it sufficient to answer -- and this is its complete answer -- "but it is obvious that a tax put upon the cattle of the lessees is too remote and indirect to be deemed a tax upon the land for privileges of the Indians."</text>
            <text syncTime="488.835" offset="2058742">This is precisely the distinction this Court has reaffirmed since the decline of the federal instrumentality doctrine in far broader circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.555" offset="2101582">When the legal incidence of a tax is on the United States itself, the tax is invalid; when, however, the legal incidence of a state tax falls on someone else, even though its economic impact is felt by the United States, and even though it may be alone in that feeling, the tax is valid unless it is expressly preempted by a federal statute and there are a number of such statutes.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="526.085" stopTime="535.570">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="526.085" offset="2207744">Mr. Gorton, just so I understand it, if the legal incidence of this tax had fallen on the retailer, the Indian retailer, it would clearly be invalid.</text>

          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="535.570" stopTime="536.635">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="535.570" offset="2245674">It would be.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="536.635" stopTime="537.836">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="536.635" offset="2249958">Okay.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="537.836" stopTime="833.702">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="537.836" offset="2254764">The tribes here claim a more expansive preemption to apply when a state tax on a private party impacts the income of those tribes than obtains when such a tax impacts the United States government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.574" offset="2321638">But Mescalero and Moe teach us that no such expansive claim can be supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.449" offset="2349119">Finally, rather than following respondents' invitation to focus on federal statutes which have nothing to do with taxes, like the Indian Financing Act or the Indian Self-Determination Act, we should look briefly at acts which do explicitly address questions of state taxing power over Indians and Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.103" offset="2435741">Those acts include the Buck Act, Public Law 280, and various termination acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.500" offset="2461341">The first two expressly disclaim any intention to delegate to the states any power to tax Indians on their reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.192" offset="2496136">The latter determination acts, of course, do authorize just such taxes after termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.305" offset="2524557">None of those acts so much as mention any non-Indian immunity from state taxation on their reservation activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.171" offset="2560084">The reason for that is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.758" offset="2570428">It never occurred to Congress that there was any such immunity, and Congress was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.475" offset="2601253">Now, incidentally, the same analysis which applies to the determination of the existence of non-Indian tax immunity on reservations, is there a statute or a treaty creating them, seems also to be the key at least to your modern determinations of the validity of state attempts to tax on reservation Indians themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.729" offset="2690278">While such cases are decided against the backdrop of the Indian's sovereignty doctrine, a statutory or treaty provision always seems to provide the basis for preempting a state tax levied on reservation Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.974" offset="2739284">In McClanahan it was the Navajo Treaty and a statutory pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.219" offset="2756211">In connection with the compensating use tax invalidated in Mescalero, it was a single section of the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.171" offset="2788080">In Moe, state taxes on reservation Indians were preempted only by the statutes cited in McClanahan and Mescalero and not by any doctrine of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.792" offset="2838549">Inevitably, therefore, the question here must be what if any treaty or statutory source can be found to prevent the state from taxing non-Indians engaged in purchases of cigarettes which purchases were identical to those in Moe.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.376" offset="2908871">The statutory pattern here is unchanged from the statutory pattern in that case and the applicable treaty provisions here, among those who are treaty tribes, are identical in effect to those of the Helgate Treaty present in the Moe case.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.989" offset="2983372">Although the tribal participation in the cigarette basis in the Yakima case here as to the tribal lease arrangements, purchasing control and administrative fees present in Moe, only the tribes' wholesaling functions in that cigarette business, the tribes claim that a congressional policy of encouraging Indian self-government preempts the state taxes in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.605" offset="3085772">The Indian Reorganization Act and subsequent federal enactments cited by respondents in their preemption argument seem to be designed to accomplish twin goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.976" offset="3127254">First, to improve the economic status of individual Indians; and, second, to foster tribal self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.512" offset="3161422">As this Court characterized the Indian Reorganization Act in the Mescalero opinion, "these provisions were designed to encourage tribal enterprises to enter the white world on a footing of equal competition."</text>
            <text syncTime="781.486" offset="3229341">Now, Moe tells us that no federal statute or treaty gives an individual Indian a huge competitive advantage in the cigarette business by preempting a state tax levied on non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.595" offset="3281795">Thomas v. Gay, Mescalero, and Moe teaches that the mere fact that a non-Indian tax may adversely impact tribal income does not trigger en automatic preemption of that state tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.525" offset="3341458">How then can a tribal entry into the cigarette business, with or without a tribal tax, trigger a preemption which gives the tribe a prohibitive competitive advantage in the teeth of the federal goal to encourage tribal enterprises to enter the non-Indian business world on a footing of equal competition?</text>

            <text syncTime="833.702" offset="3438216">General Gorton is the extent of the competitive advantage significant in your argument?</text>
            <text syncTime="839.693" offset="3462144">Now, apparently there is both an excise tax and a sales tax, and is the same argument applicable to both?</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.658" offset="5130010">The Constitution or laws of the United States might have prohibited such a tax, but the laws of the Yakima Nation could not have done so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.190" offset="5352155">Nothing in this submission, of course, is designed to deny the realities of the tribal self-government doctrine and the proposition of state actions may not infringe on the right of reservation Indians to make their own lives or to be ruled by them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.450" offset="5477125">Negatively, it prohibits the state from applying its laws to on-reservation Indians and enforcing those laws in state courts except where authorized by Congress to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.100" offset="5527803">This protection necessarily requires non-Indians to sue reservation Indians in tribal court in order to enforce rights created on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.217" offset="5572211">A state tax upon non-Indians cannot possibly affect that right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and to be governed by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.204" offset="5612231">This Court has never extended that doctrine to bar a state tax on non-Indians, nor should it do so now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.292" offset="5644518">To do so would be to subvert the very foundations of state sovereignty and the ability of the state to adopt a just and equitable tax system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.520" offset="5773458">That action would have exactly the same effect on tribal cigarette sales and tribal income as would the imposition of the state's tax on reservations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.094" offset="5903757">The state of Washington has chosen rationally to levy high excise taxes on tobacco and liquor, among other things, either to discourage their consumption or to concentrate its revenue sources on socially marginal activities rather than on important activities such as the purchase of food.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.221" offset="5984214">That choice and similar future choices are threatened by the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.645" offset="6009919">Our state might well choose in the future to impose extremely high excise taxes on, say the purchase of gold or of motor vehicles which make less than 20 miles per gallon of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.102" offset="6063731">Should the District Court be affirmed, however, the sale of those goods if the tax were high enough could immediately be monopolized by Indian tribes by the simple expedient of adopting tribal ordinances similar to those at issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.306" offset="7928560">But the issue of a tax that directly and substantially interferes with tribal self-government was not presented in McClanahan and l do not read that footnote in Moe to have disposed of the constitutional issues that were not before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.727" offset="8058232">You will remember that the Court in Williams said that the question was whether absent governing laws of Congress, state law could impermissibly interfere with tribal self-government and this Court in Williams also recognized that the holding of the United States Supreme Court in Worcester was also a constitutional holding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.889" offset="8246941">McClanahan did say, Your Honor, that the Indian sovereignty doctrine was the backdrop and not the dispositive principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.917" offset="8279019">But I think what the Court was saying was that the Worcester principle originally announced by Mr. Justice Marshall had been somewhat modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.706" offset="8314232">Originally, as the opinion in Worcester makes clear, the Court treated Indian reservations at that time as a virtual island, a boundary of which state law could not cross under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.992" offset="8367313">And in McClanahan the Court noted that in situations where tribal governments were not affected and the rights of Indians were not affected, state law could be applied to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.045" offset="8423528">On the other hand, the Court in Williams made clear, and as well in McClanahan, that the basic holding of Worcester, the basic constitutional holding still remained intact in situations where essential governmental relations, essential tribal relations were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.456" offset="8489148">And I don't think that the Moe footnote can or should be read to eliminate a line of constitutional argument that was not even at issue and before the Court in Moe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.951" offset="8547140">Now, it is clear that the practical impact of the imposition of this state tax will be to totally destroy the tribes' ability to tax in the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.844" offset="8606699">The District Court specifically found that one of the results of imposition of the state taxes will be the elimination of the essential tax revenues needed by these tribal programs, needed for the financing of these tribal programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.593" offset="8665736">In addition, the court found that a result of the imposition of these taxes would be forced relinquishment of these critically needed tribal programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.846" offset="8706800">Now, ultimately the principle that the state contends for here is that the Indian tribe would have no ability whatsoever to tax transactions on the reservation that are already being taxed by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.149" offset="8759986">By the same token, an Indian tribe, if the state's principle is granted, would be committing economic suicide if it also attempts to tax transactions in which there is no state tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.996" offset="8807320">In either case, the result of imposing the state tax would be that Indian commerce and transactions on the reservation would be more expensive than those transactions off the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.621" offset="8865834">Now, Indian tribes are already suffering from depressed economies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.412" offset="8885060">Our tribes are geographically isolated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.940" offset="8895091">It is difficult enough for them to rehabilitate themselves and provide essential services with these physical and geographical disabilities.</text>

Washington, when the Washington tax system was last before this Court, and at that time they said -- they reversed the Washington tax scheme, saying we reverse and send it back, the Supreme Court decision, and we ask you to look first at the state law and second at the McClanahan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.935" offset="12031143">And when the Supreme Court of the state of Washington then dealt with it, they said that under state law the tax did not apply and therefore reversed their original decision, but not based on the McClanahan principle because they took care of it and the state law did not arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.972" offset="12119228">In McClanahan, this Court determined that Arizona had exceeded its power when it attempted to apply Arizona's individual income tax to a reservation Indian, regardless of whether or not this action infringed on the tribal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.068" offset="12187669">This Court has said in Bryan v. Itasca County that the McClanahan principle provides that state laws are not applicable to tribal Indians on Indian reservations reservations except where Congress has expressly provided that state laws shall apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.363" offset="12256841">My learned friend, General Gorton, relies on this Court's holding in Moe v. Salish and Kootenai Tribes and submits that the McClanahan principle is not applicable to this instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.848" offset="12306787">I would like to discuss the reason that I believe and submit the reason that I believe that Moe is not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.084" offset="12331760">In Moe, what this Court did, as I read the decision, was to uphold the District Court's denial of a restraint of criminal arrest of Indian retailers selling unstamped cigarettes to non-Indians contrary to the state criminal code on the site of the reservation where Congress had expressly authorized state criminal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.453" offset="12429145">Moe did not involve the collection of taxes from Indian retailers, it did not involve a state licensing or the state regulation of Indian retailers; while here this case involves the collection of the taxes if the Indians do not collect them from the non-Indian purchasers or collect the taxes from the Indian purchasers, and also provide for the state regulation of the retailers to provide with the state regulations in regards to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.946" offset="12571146">My friend, General Gorton, suggests that it has the power to collect these taxes and we believe that is not correct because where these transactions took place on the Yakima Reservation were within the exterior boundaries of the Yakima Reservation and on trust land where there is no jurisdiction, the state has no criminal or civil jurisdiction over the Indians involved on these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.751" offset="12694340">This Court in Washington v. Yakima Nation last term upheld that this was part of the state's purpose, to provide for state government to keep the jurisdiction off of that and held that Congress had to have in mind, especially had that in mind when it passed Public Law 286, that such a partial quoting of jurisdiction could be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.587" offset="12797680">Now, the transactions which Washington claimed taxing power all took place on these lands and there was no jurisdiction over the tribal members at all for an regulatory power, arrest power, civil or criminal, judicial or legislative power over the Indians involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.212" offset="12876257">And as this Court said in McClanahan, unless the states can show how they can constitutionally impose the collection of this tax and the regulation on the Indians where they have no jurisdiction, legislative or judicial, then that disposes of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.526" offset="12961520">And that is pages 178 and 179 of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.032" offset="12983463">Now, Washington -- my friend, General Gorton, submits that Washington, in his brief, may seize without process, due or otherwise, goods being delivered to my clients in interstate commerce on trust lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.350" offset="13056815">Now, these goods that are being delivered to my clients, the Yakima Nation, are not taxable in any event because it is clear that these goods are sold to Indians on the Indian reservation, on trust lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.364" offset="13120867">The Yakima Nation does not sell to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.121" offset="13131839">Non-Indian retailers later sell -- I mean the Indian retailers of course later sell to non-Indians, but when these goods are in transit they are not being sent to the Yakima Indian Reservation in interstate commerce by bonded carriers, the sale to the Yakima Nation is a legal one to its licensed retailers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3448.839" offset="13898689">The reason I do not disagree with him is because this is not a case in which Congress has been silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.775" offset="13938500">This is not a case in which Congress has been silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.949" offset="13955218">Congress has in passing the Buck Act said that it permits the state to levy sales, use or income taxes in federal areas but it expressly provides that nothing therein shall be deemed to authorize the collection or any tax on or from any Indian not taxed and, as pointed out in our cases in the brief, this is a continuance of an existing thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.180" offset="14068067">Now, I was particularly interested in a decision written by Justice Donaldson for the Mahoney majority in the Idaho Supreme Court, and I adopt his understanding and I adopt his rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.310" offset="14148629">As he pointed out, the Congress must have been aware at the time it passed the Buck Act in section 109 of the existing solicitor's opinion of the United States that opinioned that Indians are not subject to state laws whether they deal with Indians or non-Indians, in the tax field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.789" offset="14238490">Now, that Mahoney decision is a weight one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.410" offset="14249044">You see, that is the circumstance we have surrounding us, Idaho underneath their state law does not tax -- does not try to impress the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.171" offset="14296064">I think it is worth nothing that with the regularity that this Court sees Mr. Gorton, that the state of Washington has somewhat different attitude about Indian rights in some of our neighboring states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.735" offset="14354265">But one of the things, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in your question you were talking a little bit about some of the discussion of McClanahan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3597.114" offset="14491878">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.298" offset="14504521">Perhaps before attempting to join them back together, it might be useful if I sought to unravel the several strands of the argument as we see it on this side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.432" offset="14565125">Without pretending that any single one of these arguments is sufficient to carry the day, it is in our submission useful to look at three arguments that when joined do in our submission justify the holding of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.872" offset="14650911">I identify them first as the territorial principle; secondly, as the commercial principle; and thirdly is the governmental principle, somewhat arbitrary titles for the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.568" offset="14705664">But the territorial idea is one which, of course, dates from the very earliest cases in this Court dealing with Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.204" offset="14740146">It is basically the notion that only in exceptional circumstances, as this Court repeated only last term, may state law or state taxes invade that area which has been reserved to the continuing sovereignty of the tribe albeit in a most limited way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.818" offset="14834604">And the question therefore is whether this case, this tax or these taxes fall within that exception, not the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.039" offset="14875564">The burden is not on the tribe to show that this particular tax would normally apply but for reasons (a), (b), and (c) it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.095" offset="14919764">The burden is very much on the state to justify the intrusion of its laws, its taxes within an area still separate in some meaningful sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.959" offset="14963231">Now, that principle is not only an old one, it is one which has been reiterated as recently as Wheeler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.968" offset="14999280">It is a principle which has been the basis for distinguishing between activities on and off reservation, including cases in the tax area, noticeably the Mescalero opinion in 411 U.S. reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.534" offset="15069497">I suggest that the result in that case in respect of the sales tax or gross profits tax would have been different had that ski enterprise been on rather than off the reservation, and the thrust of the opinion as I read it is the emphasis on the fact that the immunity has its limits its geographic limits and cannot be imported beyond the limits of the reservation or exported and, of course, there is no attempt to do so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.699" offset="15226128">There is, of course, a giving way of reservation boundaries over the years with the opening up policy which results in non-Indians living on the reservation, but that historic fact has nothing to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.727" offset="15290284">We are not dealing with a modern change of fact which requires a change of law because the Yakima Reservation is inhabited by a substantial non-Indian population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.142" offset="15347963">We are dealing with Indian trade which has been going on since the beginning in which the white man sells to the Indian and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.614" offset="15385788">Instead of dealing with furs or with other skins or with horses or with tobacco in its raw form, we now deal with cigarettes and the principle ought to be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.834" offset="15450676">Of course, it matters what the effect of the state's intrusion is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.275" offset="15476485">If it is law, if it is tax, it impinges only on the non-Indian residents or the non-indian while on the reservation, that is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.832" offset="15526745">That is not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.183" offset="15540120">The effect is not indirect, it is not remote, it is not minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.531" offset="15557465">It destroys a tribal enterprise and it is a tribal enterprise and not a private one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.944" offset="15591111">With those remarks, I turn to the second aspect which is the burden which this state tax places on the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.688" offset="15646072">Simply to illustrate than there is such a principle and indeed a constitutional principle which derives directly from the Indian commerce clause, when we only posit a state law which prohibited implementation, if I may use that word, into the state of Washington of products grown or manufactured on the Yakima Reservation, such a law would be manifestly unconstitutional as violating the Indian commerce clause and so would the reverse, a prohibition on the exportation of products into an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.262" offset="15820466">Now, of course, that is not this case but simply illustrates that the Indian commerce clause has, like the other aspects of the commerce clause, a self-executing force which may be relevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.861" offset="15886817">Here we deal with state taxes which not only burden the commerce between Indian and non-Indian but which in this respect destroy it, utterly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.565" offset="15949615">The District Court found that the state sales taxes as applied to furniture and other manufacture did not have that effect, that the effect was not demonstrated and presumptively minimal and accordingly did not invalidate those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.368" offset="16028818">Here the combined effect of the state excise and sales tax on cigarettes admittedly destroyed that commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.033" offset="16075525">That effect, it seems to us, implicates the Indian commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.949" offset="16103215">Now, finally and perhaps most importantly, we look at the governmental aspects of the case and here the great distinction between this case and Moe.</text>

            <text syncTime="4177.975" offset="16815313">There are gradations, but if you look at it from the other extreme it seems absurd perhaps that Washington would claim its right to tax even the most traditional Indian artifacts that are used on the reservation which would not otherwise come into commerce at all, and yet the Attorney General was quite clear that he would apply the same rule to that situation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="4505.531" offset="18125511">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.100" offset="18143796">Mr. Anderson's presentation seemed primarily devoted to the responsibility of the Indians and the limitation of what was described as a modest business, emphasizing the fact that at the present time his tribal clients limit sales to three cartons of cigarettes a piece and that it was only on that basis that the District Court permitted the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.248" offset="18260407">That is demonstrably not the case, as there is no limitation in the Yakima ordinances which were upheld at exactly the same time and in the same set of cases by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.560" offset="18313592">As a matter of fact, there is a showing in the record of the extremely long distances which people drive to purchase on the Yakima Reservation not only for their own use but for the use of their friends and neighbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.416" offset="18373047">He also seemed to say, I believe, Mr. Rehnquist, that somehow or another that, while Footnote 17 in the Moe case stated that tax exemptions to Indians on reservation had only a statutory basis, that tax exemptions to non-Indians had a constitutional basis, which seems to me to be relatively inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.695" offset="18486105">Finally, each of my opponents here has attempted at one stage or another to avoid the logical extension of their argument in dealing with how many economic enterprises the tribe could engage in, displacing -- to take state tax authority over its own residents For example, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, when you asked Mr. Claiborne the hypothetical of the manufacturing enterprise controlled by the tribe on reservation, he said that the state could impose its use tax after its citizens had purchased those automobiles and removed them from the reservation because you didn't include a tribal tax in your hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.822" offset="18698637">Clearly, his answer would have been that were there even the most modest tribal taxes, that that enterprise too would be tax free.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.127" offset="18731865">As a matter of fact, he made that quite express when later on in his presentation he stated that in all probability that the state taxes would be invalid without a tax by the Indian tribes simply because of the tribal participation in the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.119" offset="18807829">While each of these gentlemen has stated that they do not seek here to reargue or to reverse law, in effect every one of them, every one of their arguments for all practical purposes requires reading Moe out of the United States reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="4698.912" offset="18899048">The pure fact that the matter is that I do agree with Mr. Claiborne on one statement only, and that is, of course, that the state could have the same effect on tribal businesses simply by repealing its tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.643" offset="18961951">What that shows more clearly than anything else is the fact that the state tax system is not an interference with tribal self-government, because the effect of a state action is identical in either event.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.131" offset="19027884">If the state has the right to make one decision, it clearly has the right to make another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.037" offset="19051499">Nothing in the state's program here prohibits any type of regulation of business on reservations by the Indian tribes, nothing in our submission here prohibits them from adding markups or taxes to their tribal enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="4753.706" offset="19118164">We simply say that they are subject to the same economic constraints that a state is in a taxing policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.618" offset="19145853">A state can certainly impose a tax which will be self-defeating because it will be so high that people will not purchase either the commodity or the commodity in a particular place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.856" offset="19190784">State legislatures must deal with that question every day of the week, and we simply say that tribal councils must do so, too, and do not have a constitutional right in effect to be parasites on the state system, gaining from the state system only because of rational state decisions in connection with its own tax authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.961" offset="19287228">They do have a retained right in self-government, that right does not however include the right to distort a state tax system and to make it either ineffective or unjust.</text>
