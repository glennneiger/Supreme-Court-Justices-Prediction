            <text syncTime="246.289" offset="1088554">And after this Court's ruling in the Forest City Enterprises case and parallel California cases, which are cited on the briefs, that is a purely legislative act, so that there were no administrative remedies to exhaust.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.745" offset="1142366">This ordinance, the -- the legislation itself, does not set up any administrative review proceedings -- procedure, so that one could do it only in the same sense that if the legislature of the State of California were to adopt an unconstitutional statute, one can say -- one could say, “Well, why don't you go to Sacramento and ask them to change it before you challenge it in court?”</text>
            <text syncTime="283.676" offset="1238079">Now, as I understand this Court's precedents, that is Euclid versus Ambler, which was quite explicit on the point that is not required to be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.587" offset="6313671">It is alleged that the appellants bought the property for residential use and as the Court has observed, the California Supreme Court required that it be made available for residential use, by the construction that placed upon the zoning ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.003" offset="6355362">That is at least, one home must be allowed by the city and up to five maybe allowed by the city under the terms of the zoning ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1656.355" offset="6728808">Construe those ordinances as requiring the city to allow residential use, then determine under the substantive test for encroachment upon private rights that the -- the remaining available reasonable use rendered nugatory that allegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.409" offset="6988988">So, what we say is the city can't very well indicate in advance, how many units it would approve because the necessary environmental review hasn't occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.369" offset="7024828">There's no way to know the physical circumstances and enough detail to indicate how many units might be approved, but the Supreme Court of our State has said, “Residential use must be approved from one to five units.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.408" offset="7865031">In other words, if owner's dedication requirements that were unreasonable under any standard were imposed, the -- the owner could litigate that following the city's action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2745.580" offset="11085720">I just like to mention briefly this -- this remedy question which has been much briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.318" offset="11108603">If the Court agrees with our position that this ordinance is valid on -- on its face or this case could be considered one were administrative remedy should be exhausted and of course, the question of what remedy to invoke following an unconstitutional action or an encroachment on private property rights would not be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.204" offset="11172237">But the concept of the remedy to be applied to regulation is really based on the need to accommodate two very strong powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.489" offset="11209331">One is the power to regulate which this Court has observed to be one of the list limitable powers of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.144" offset="11231901">In fact, local zoning authority has been observed to be about the most essential power held by local Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.841" offset="11258755">And where that power comes into conflict with protected property rights, then there are no absolutes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.467" offset="11285191">What is necessary is to engage in the balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.438" offset="11297102">And we submit that the proper balance to be struck in that circumstance is to invalidate the offending measure that preserves that police power as an essential power and it provides fairness to the property owner in the sense that a property owner normally does not commence development procedure or process with the idea of having the city and buying his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.526" offset="11381426">He commences that process with the idea of commencing some development.Invalidation allows him to go forward with some form of development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.095" offset="11411728">Also under California law, declaratory relief and mandate have priority on the court calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.279" offset="11436492">So it's much faster to receive a judicial resolution of these kinds of conflicts to declaratory relief and mandamus than it is to go inverse condemnation which can stick around on a trial calendar for a good long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.208" offset="11492185">So, we think it's an appropriate constitutional balance between these two strong interest and we submit that this Court has recognized that essentially, the payment of compensation or money damages is a legislative choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.035" offset="11547564">And that is an aspect to the separation of powers since legislatures under our structure of Government are the ones that appropriate and expend public funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.976" offset="11579225">And in this cases which don't have to do with the police power, U.S. Trust versus New Jersey, involving the impairment of bondholders' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.995" offset="11611303">Perhaps somewhat a kin to interference with investment-backed expectations as discussed in Penn Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.918" offset="11635022">The Court was careful to note that while invalidating New Jersey's repeal, the State of New Jersey was not frustrated in trying to carryout its new public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.336" offset="11668668">It could invoke its power of eminent domain and compensate effective property interest and proceed with its new policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.065" offset="11695626">The critical point there is that it was a matter of legislative choice, not court decree, that compensation would be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.996" offset="11731362">So it was reserved to the legislature as a legislative matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.186" offset="11748080">And finally, I would notice, this has been noted in cases involving the Civil Rights Act, the prospectively chilling effect that monetary damages would have in circumstances where there cannot be easily anticipated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2947.154" offset="11891963">I think that where a State moves or local agency moves by eminent domain, it's not a regulatory act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.489" offset="11917354">That isn't -- that is the exercise of sort of proprietary direct governmental powers, not adjusting the public good, but moving to the benefit of Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3421.840" offset="13790751">Well, that's perhaps because of the way you undertook to set this litigation in motion, instead of asking for what is provided under California -- under the city's ordinance, an opportunity to get five sites and you passed that opportunity and plunged right in to the total litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3439.501" offset="13861386">Well, may I respectfully point up and call to the Court's attention the basic American seminal case, Euclid versus Ambler, whereat 272 U.S. 386.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.135" offset="13915930">That very issue was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.588" offset="13921677">The Court said, “A motion was made in the court below to dismiss the bill on the grounds that because the complainant had made no effort to obtain a building permit or applied to the Zoning Board of Appeals for relief, as it might have done under the terms of the ordinance, the suit was premature.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.910" offset="13983013">The motion was properly overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.209" offset="13992208">The effect of the allegations to the bill is that the ordinance on its own force operates greatly to reduce the value of appellee's land and destroy their marketability for industrial, commercial and residential uses.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.992" offset="14039333">I won't go on to the quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.686" offset="14046124">We were and still are relying on that and it seems to us that the Court would have to overrule not only Nectow versus Cambridge, but Euclid as well, to deprive ourselves of an opportunity to rely on that, what was until now, a clear principle of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.372" offset="14112893">May I touch on the -- on just of a couple of facts?</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.883" offset="14122924">Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I wanted to make very clear that in responding to your question, sir, I intended to indicate that even one -- one house cannot be built because of the prohibit of cost of our offsite improvements, that is a large 5-acre parcel on a ridge and in order to prepare it and provide access to it, utilities and so on, it would be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.105" offset="14215816">Now, as to the -- the question also, Mr. Chief Justice, you commented on the California Supreme Court's opinion as to what they did decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.899" offset="14246954">May I respectfully call your attention to page 9 in the appendix that a jurisdictional statement where they tell us as to that first part of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.079" offset="14279659">In HFH Ltd., we specifically noted that, “This case does not present and we therefore do not decide the question of entitlement to compensation in the event a zoning regulation forbade substantially all,” that's emphasized, “substantially all use of a land in question, we leave that question for another day.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.202" offset="14364191">That was the HFH quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.930" offset="14371088">They now go on and say, “We now reached that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.919" offset="14387075">They did reach that issue as to what happens when substantially all use of his owned land is destroyed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.422" offset="14417063">So I respectfully disagree with my colleague and I urge the Court to consider that passage because there, the California Supreme Court tells us expressly what they did reach and which they did decide.</text>
