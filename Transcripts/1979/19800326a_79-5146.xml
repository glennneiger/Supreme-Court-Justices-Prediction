            <text syncTime="53.304" offset="316583">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.891" offset="326928">The case before you today presents four issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.973" offset="339257">The primary issue is the first issue, and it deals with whether the petitioner, David Rawlings, has standing, that is, is he entitled to raise a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments generated by the illegal search of the purse of Vanessa Cox and the seizure from that purse of property, including contraband drugs, on the basis that the property, one, belonged to Mr. Rawlings, and, two, on the basis that he was charged with an offense that was the possession of those very contraband drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.396" offset="492962">The second issue in this case deals with the question of whether the searches and seizures, all of them, not only of Vanessa Cox's purse but also of Mr. Rawlings, and the other incriminating evidence were the fruits of an unconstitutional detention and arrest of both petitioner and Vanessa Cox in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.351" offset="584808">The third issue and the fourth issue in the case are derivative issues that depend upon this Court finding the first issue in favor of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.508" offset="625455">But I would point out to the Court that the third issue, that the search of Vanessa Cox's purse was unconstitutional, has been conceded in this Court by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.544" offset="669550">So the question is whether or not we are entitled to assert the illegalities in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.983" offset="695254">I would immediately turn to that first issue and tell you that we are proceeding on three different theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.337" offset="720750">We are proceeding first on the theory of automatic standing, because under any restrictive construction that you give to the doctrine of automatic standing, David Rawlings clearly qualifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.100" offset="771741">The theory of the prosecution's case, the indictment, everything points to the fact that David Rawlings is charged with possession of these contraband drugs while they are in the purse of Vanessa Cox, and when they were searched, October 18, 1976 is the date of the crime and the date of the purse.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.152" offset="851989">So there is no question as to whether or not we were entitled to automatic standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.669" offset="1090017">Addressing the question of automatic standing in this situation, I would like to refer to three major concepts that are involved here, and I think -- excuse me, there would be two, and the first one would be subdivided into three concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.408" offset="1137037">The first question is the dilemma of self-incrimination, and we have argued in our brief and we take the position that Simmons has not eradicated completely for the defendant the dilemma of self-incrimination that occurs when he must take the stand in a suppression hearing and testify to either ownership or possession of the premises searched where the possessory offense crime was committed, that is where the possession of the contraband material occurred, or where he must take the stand and admit either ownership or possession of the contraband goods themselves which are the very gravamen of the offense with which he is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.915" offset="1291055">We say that this exists for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.852" offset="1298787">The first one is the danger of impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.869" offset="1310804">And as this Court will know, it does not require a situation where a defendant takes the stand in a suppression hearing and says one thing and then takes the stand at trial and says another thing that is an outright lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.077" offset="1367646">All in most jurisdictions required for impeachment is an inconsistent statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.916" offset="1387081">So if this defendant wants to assert, for example, possessory ownership, possessory interest or ownership interest in the contraband, he may come in and say, in this particular situation I owned the suitcase in which this was found, and in that situation when he asserts that in a possessory offense, he may then want to take the stand and say but I didn't have the slightest idea how the drugs got in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.336" offset="1496691">Once he would say I don't have the slightest idea how the drugs got in there, then the prosecutor could say us we want to introduce the inconsistency that that was his suitcase, and in that situation a marginal --</text>

            <text syncTime="362.537" offset="1553533">Well, Your Honor, I can only say to you that I have seen numerous cases on appeal in which that type of ruling has been made by the trial court and affirmed on appeal that that is enough of an inconsistency to allow the question of credibility to be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.112" offset="1611839">The real issue --</text>

            <text syncTime="380.298" offset="1624586">The real issue, Your Honor, is will it deter a defendant and his defense attorney from going ahead and challenging the propriety of a Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.677" offset="1670040">That was the rationale behind Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.927" offset="1679130">You reaffirmed that in McGautha v. California when you said the reason why we say this is a dilemma of self-incrimination here is because the danger is it will deter people from bringing marginal Fourth Amendment claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.046" offset="1815594">I am not trying to say that the underpinnings of McGautha with regard to death penalty is still good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.900" offset="1839000">I am just talking about your discussion of the tension and the reasons in Simmons behind the prophylactic rule that you enunciated.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.307" offset="1864600">It seems to me that all your reasoning is that the defendant should be encouraged to do everything he can to prevent the prosecution from establishing the truth or falsity of the charges it brings against him if there is some constitutional implication in the thing, and that no weight should be attached whatever to the usefulness of the trial as a process for finding out whether or not the charges are true.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.177" offset="1980061">I think there are two important considerations, when I respond to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.315" offset="1992600">I think the first one very basically is I cannot accept Chief Justice Burger's position that every motion to suppress is a motion to exclude the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.838" offset="2026768">That simply has not been the result of practical experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.249" offset="2044322">Sometimes it excludes the truth, sometimes it excludes falsity done by the police, such as motion to exclude or suppress on the basis of an involuntary confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.777" offset="2086431">You have even said in cases such as Mincey v. Arizona that the very question of the validity of the truthfulness of that confession is at issue and you would not allow impeachment under similar circumstances to Harris v. New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.371" offset="2136900">So we can't just start off with a presumption that every motion to suppress is an attempt to destroy the truth-finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.369" offset="2164799">In some instances it may very well be, but I think the second and most important response that we have here goes to the concept of what was talked about earlier, and that is this vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.197" offset="2208162">And I would just simply jump ahead to that to say that what is the government attempting to say.</text>

            <text syncTime="598.817" offset="2498644">The example you give is very true.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.071" offset="2607626">It is not going to open up all kinds of opportunities for prosecutorial fishing expedition, and it is probably not going to generate much in the way of impeachment or the substantive use of prior inconsistent statements in a jurisdiction like Kentucky.</text>

            <text syncTime="1117.470" offset="4573288">Another example they give construction possession, the very definition of constructive possession is such a nexus between the thing seized and the defendant, such dominion and control that the defendant would almost have actual standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.851" offset="4630758">So I would say in that situation there is really no harm generated by applying automatic standing, and the examples given by the Solicitor General certainly do not show a bad result generated by the use of automatic standing in those two examples.</text>

            <text syncTime="1164.780" offset="4762520">The second one is the ownership or possessory interest in the thing seized, that is, generates automatic standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.174" offset="4824064">I tried to say that the reason I was using the terms "automatic standing" and "actual standing" is, even though you did away with those in Rakas, the appellate courts of this country as well as the trial courts are still fumbling around, as I am, with the concept of what is left over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.662" offset="4882056">I know in Rakas you said the inquiry would be the same under your new best, reasonable expectation of privacy, as it was under the old concepts of actual standing, so I tried to integrate the two vocabularies and I hope I haven't indicated that I don't follow the reasoning of Rakas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.174" offset="4948093">In this particular regard, I would say what do we have in this situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.538" offset="4965543">This defendant, when he was denied automatic standing took the stand and admitted ownership of the drugs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1238.524" offset="5057494">In this case, the defendant's interest in the property that he put in her purse gave him the right to complain about that violation, and this is also, of course --</text>

            <text syncTime="1691.195" offset="6868198">Are we to believe that society no longer would recognize your own personal expectation of privacy, even though she is carrying that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.342" offset="6952730">Clearly, there is an expectation of privacy there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.823" offset="6962657">In the reply brief I have cited for you Prof. Goffman in "Relations in Public," talking about what people expect with regard to privacy rights, and one of the key things is joint tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.901" offset="7015006">Joint tenure can be generated in a purse, it can be generated in a briefcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.889" offset="7034964">And I think your cases such as Arkansas v. Sanders and Chadwick v.

            <text syncTime="1749.954" offset="7103195">If I do it with consent, if I do it with their permission, then of course I realize I do it with the limitation that they may consent, and then I lose my privacy rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.125" offset="7271842">If she really wanted him to remove the information, remove the drugs from her purse, she had 45 minutes while she sat there with the police and all she had to do at any time was to say, "David, here are the drugs," but she didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.110" offset="7331819">She waited until the police said open up your purse, she dumped them out and all of a sudden the drugs are revealed and now she says, "David, you'd better take what is yours."</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.312" offset="7368600">If she really wanted him not to have an expectation of privacy, then she had 45 minutes while she was right there with the police officers where she could have said, "David, remember three minutes before they got here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.927" offset="7407052">Take the drugs."</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.434" offset="7873076">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.436" offset="7893138">Automatic standing in possession cases is no longer necessary for the protection of substantive Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.727" offset="7926262">As we have heard this afternoon, the basis for automatic standing which came out in Jones was simply the problem of self-incrimination, i.e., the clash between one asserting his Fourth Amendment rights at perhaps the expense of the Fifth Amendment; and the second aspect, which we contend basically was thrown in as an afterthought, and that is the so-called vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.494" offset="8041305">We submit simply that Simmons has solved the problem at least of that portion of Jones which says self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.898" offset="8086967">An individual may go in at a motion to suppress and assert his Fourth Amendment substantive rights without fear of this being used against him as evidence of his guilt at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.010" offset="8155408">The fact that it may come back a little later as perhaps impeachment purposes, we would submit is not sufficient to expand the exclusionary rule to exclude this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.582" offset="8229700">The purpose of the exclusionary rule, of course, is to deter unlawful police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.144" offset="8255927">In a Fifth Amendment context, in the Harris case, this Court has said we are unwilling to extend the exclusionary rule to the point where it would give the defendant the right to commit perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.722" offset="8302216">We are submitting that this is just as applicable to the Fourth Amendment right as it is within the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.370" offset="8332831">This we submit is sufficient as to the impeachment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.353" offset="8352789">The petitioner in this case has pointed out a case in Kentucky called Jett, and I would like to read the rule in Jett for the purpose of substantive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.253" offset="8400436">And it says, "Out of court statements made by any person who appears as a witness, which statement is relevant and material to issues, may be received as substantive evidence through another witness and need not be limited to impeachment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.702" offset="8478177">We submit that this is simply the very situation which Simmons attempted or does in fact, we submit, cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.200" offset="8512136">First of all, we would say that testimony at a suppression hearing is not necessarily an out of court statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.849" offset="8538781">It is part of the same proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.081" offset="8547662">Second, it would require that the person making the statement, i.e., the accused, first testify as a witness before Jett would come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.919" offset="8607013">Finally, the key here, that which is substantive, material, relevant to the issues, i.e., substantive use of evidence of guilt, is that which is prohibited in Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.698" offset="8666154">That leaves only the impeachment aspect of it, a contradictory statement which we submit again, as previously pointed out, is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.762" offset="8710457">Finally, the basis for the -- the only basis I should say left for Jones for the automatic concept, rather than the substantive Fourth Amendment rights, is the vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.619" offset="8789870">This is the only aspect, as the dissent in a footnote in Rakas points out, this is the only thing that is really left of Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.128" offset="8823933">We have here people who are accused of a possessory crime being treated substantially different than any other accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.064" offset="8859669">For example, I would like to point out in the same factual situation as in this case, we add one additional element, a third person has a revolver in Mrs. Cox's purse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.046" offset="8919542">As a result of that revolver being found in her purse, he is charged with murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.760" offset="8946395">Now, the respondent -- petitioner would have us believe that Mr. Rawlings is entitled to automatic standing, i.e., assertion of Mrs. Cox's Fourth Amendment rights, because of his possessionary crime where the individual who is charged with murder cannot assert vicarious Fourth Amendment right or vicariously assert it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.204" offset="9044198">We are creating or have created by this one remaining aspect of Jones a special class of defendant out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.259" offset="9084426">The vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction by merely going in upon the defendant's motion to suppress and the government saying what reasonable right of privacy, expectation of privacy did you have in that which was seized or that which was searched, and having that individual give factors to show some reason why he had a reasonable expectation of privacy, and then to come back at trial and under the concept of possession under a penal code assert that there was possession sufficient for conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.475" offset="9237295">There is nothing contradictory about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.363" offset="13492851">It is not the sole purpose, but we apply all of these factors and we look at the situation involving the purse, and that is first of all he has no possessory interest in the purse, he didn't buy the purse, he didn't give it to her, it wasn't his that she was carrying for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.869" offset="13578846">What steps did he take to protect the privacy of the purse?</text>
