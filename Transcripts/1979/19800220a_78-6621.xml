            <label>Mr. David Klingsberg</label>
            <text syncTime="30.417" offset="225050">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.937" offset="239156">This case is here on writ of certiorari for the Supreme Court of Alabama, which upheld a death sentence based on a conviction for the crime of robbery where the victim was intentionally killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.792" offset="302582">The grant of certiorari was limited to the narrow question of whether a sentence of death constitutionally may be imposed after a jury verdict of guilt of a capital offense where a jury was not permitted to consider a verdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense and when the evidence would have supported such a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.029" offset="395473">As to the second condition in Your Honors' grant of certiorari, the state has conceded that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction of a lesser included offense either of robbery or felony murder, both of which are non-capital offenses in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.920" offset="483035">The evidence supporting the lesser offense, briefly stated, is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.773" offset="506441">Petitioner confessed that he and another man named Roy Clements participated in a robbery in which the victim was killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.396" offset="548968">Petitioner, however, took the stand on his own behalf and testified that he did not do the killing, that Mr. Clements did the killing, that when Mr. Clements did do the killing, petitioner immediately protested, "Oh, my God, what did you do?"</text>
            <text syncTime="127.693" offset="614170">At which point he left the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.937" offset="627127">He denied having any weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.613" offset="637785">He denied intending to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.051" offset="651577">He said that even though there was a discussion prior to the robbery, tying up the victim, there was no discussion or intention of harming or killing the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.623" offset="701837">The principal evidence against the petitioner was the testimony of the woman who was described by petitioner as an accomplice and a lookout, which she denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.691" offset="746141">She testified that petitioner had been sharpening a knife before the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.187" offset="768084">That was also denied by petitioner and contradicted by other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.882" offset="794937">The trial judge, following the dictates of the statute in Alabama, did not charge the jury that it could find petitioner guilty of a lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.707" offset="846242">Moreover, the trial judge told the jury that if it acquitted the defendant, he could never be tried for anything that he did to the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.337" offset="896711">The Alabama circuit court, intermediate court, said that this instruction was in accordance with the Alabama statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.932" offset="939133">We contend principally --</text>

          <turn speaker="david_klingsberg" startTime="218.857" stopTime="332.664">
            <label>Mr. David Klingsberg</label>
            <text syncTime="218.857" offset="978840">The petition for writ of certiorari -- which, incidentally, was not originally in the record, but we had it sent up, a certified copy -- said that the statute violates the Constitution of the United States of America in that it violates provisions in the Constitution under the Eighth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and is in fact a mandatory death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.205" offset="1088240">The arguments which had been made below in a motion to quash the indictment on similar grounds, indicating that the procedure was akin to or in the nature of a mandatory death sentence, specifically referred to the choice which the jury was given of either, one extreme, acquitting the defendant or, the other extreme, convicting of the capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.625" offset="1201821">It is true that unfortunately even though extensive arguments were made in the circuit court directly on the point of the lesser included offense, that that was although in the petition, not in the brief to the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.959" offset="1263156">However, the Supreme Court of Alabama did affirm on the basis of its decision in the Jacobs case, which dealt only with federal constitutional issues, dealt at length with the lesser included offense issue, and there were two dissents which also incorporated and referred directly to their decisions in Jacobs which dealt practically entirely with this lesser offense question.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.173" offset="1376110">So, I think there is not any doubt that this was considered by the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.922" offset="1395022">And the question has been preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.060" offset="1403591">Moreover, the state does not challenge that, at least on the due process question, only on the equal protection argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.664" offset="1433997">Getting back to the facts, Mr. Klingsberg, I correctly or got the impression from you or your statement of the facts that your client was just along, just present.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.411" offset="1489063">But is it not a fact that he held the victim while the attacks were going on?</text>

            <text syncTime="352.524" offset="1513514">Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.553" offset="1525635">The petitioner testified that they did have an intention to tie up the victim and that he in fact had grabbed the victim from behind in order to tie him up and that at that point Mr. Clements suddenly and to the petitioner's surprise attacked him with a knife.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Klingsberg</label>
            <text syncTime="387.628" offset="1653844">No, Your Honor, there was no such testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.341" offset="1672756">The critical point from the point of view of the legal issue presented here I think is that there was a very sharp issue, very hotly contested issue on the question of intent to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.671" offset="1734092">This made it particularly important that the lesser-included-offense verdict be given to the jury as an option because the jury without it was placed in an impossible position.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.793" offset="1786546">The jury was faced, on the one hand, with the possibility of convicting of a capital offense, and the only alternative was acquittal of a defendant who was admittedly and confessed to a very serious crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.293" offset="1848508">And we say that under these circumstances, the jury would plainly have veered away from acquittal in its deliberations, particularly when attempting to resolve this delicate issue of intent to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.875" offset="1914859">If the jury's thoughts drifted toward the possibility of no intent, finding of no intent, then they would have to think, "Well, we have to acquit this defendant."</text>
            <text syncTime="465.707" offset="1966164">And the idea of acquitting a defendant who was guilty of a very serious crime, guilty of a crime of robbery in which a victim was killed, would be so repulsive to the jury that that would upset and off course the accuracy of their finding on the issue of intent to kill.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.315" offset="2064593">In the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alabama, which I take it was delivered by Mr. Justice Maddox, he starts out saying, "Petitioner Beck raises only one issue here," and then there is a colon.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.376" offset="2108897">Then he says, "Whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals erred in its finding that the Alabama death penalty statute is not in violation of Article III, Section 43, Article V, Section 124, and Amendment 38 of the 1901 constitution of Alabama."</text>

            <text syncTime="523.214" offset="2196250">Yes, Your Honor, I disagree with that because of the petition for certiorari to the Alabama Supreme Court which explicitly refers to the Eighth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.052" offset="2243584">And I disagree with it because I think the court actually considered that in light of its reference and incorporation of the Jacobs case.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.050" offset="2287574">I should also note that there was a rule in the Alabama Supreme Court which was enacted before the appeal but became effective before the appeal was decided, which enabled the Supreme Court to consider any important issues in cases such as this.</text>

            <text syncTime="601.538" offset="2509511">I think there is no question, Your Honor -- and the question is not raised by respondent -- that this matter was raised very distinctly at the trial court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.181" offset="2552142">And there was a motion to quash the indictment as contrary to rights under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.016" offset="2579414">There were citations to Gregg and Woodson.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.418" offset="2592998">And there was specifically in the argument at various points reference to the fact that the jury only has this choice of two things, of convicting of the capital offense and imposing the death sentence or acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.042" offset="2647542">It was raised on the motion to quash.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.760" offset="2654438">It was raised at transcript 527 at the end of the prosecution's case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1238.066" offset="5055613">The basis for that decision was that the resolution of doubt and the intent issue, which as in this cases was very seriously in dispute, would be affected adversely by the absence of the lesser offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.544" offset="5117576">In this case, where the crime is much more serious than simple assault, I think that the jury's reluctance to resolve doubts on the intent issue in favor of acquittal will be even greater; and, therefore, both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law, I think that there is basis in a capital case for holding that lesser offense instructions are an important procedural protection which rises to the due process level.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.695" offset="6758170">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.074" offset="6767679">Because of all the questions about the facts and the Alabama law and the procedural posture of the case, I would like to devote approximately five minutes to that topic before I turn to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.500" offset="6805400">The petitioner was not indicted, tried, and convicted for the capital crime of robbery, during the course of which the defendant was intentionally killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.111" offset="6839777">That is how the statute said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.397" offset="6845001">But the state gratuitously averred that the victim was murdered in the first degree by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.454" offset="6865168">And the Alabama Supreme Court has said when we aver it, we have to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.656" offset="6878020">It is not a variance between the statute and the indictment, but nonetheless we are stuck, so to speak, with what we say in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.423" offset="6905083">The elements of that crime, as defined in Ritter v. State -- and that is the important case of the Alabama Supreme Court on what the elements are -- was robbery, which the defendant admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.810" offset="6950640">First degree murder of the victim during the robbery, which the defendant admitted by admitting facts sufficient to constitute felony murder, first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.654" offset="6985958">And the third element, the crucial element, the one which was in some dispute at the trial, was defined in Ritter as related to the intent and culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.133" offset="7019917">Ritter said that even though the defendant did not have to actually do the killing himself, he nonetheless -- a non-trigger man or non-knife wielding defendant as in this case -- either had to have had some kind of particularized intent that the killing take place, or he had to have been a knowing accomplice to the intentional killing itself, not the robbery, but the intentional killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.388" offset="7116884">Ritter went on to define "accomplice to the intentional killing itself" as meaning that the defendant either sanctioned or knowingly facilitated the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.326" offset="7156694">And the facts in this case, the defendant and the co-defendant Clements both admitted they went there and both participated in a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.883" offset="7182921">They both admitted that when they left, both victims were dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.296" offset="7196505">They of course disputed who committed the murder, the actual stabbing or throat cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.081" offset="7223672">Each one blamed it on the other one and said, "Oh, I was just shocked, I was appalled, I had no idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.872" offset="7242898">I was just sick at heart when I found out what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.860" offset="7254810">And I immediately repudiated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.829" offset="7262647">"In other words, both of them admitted robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.521" offset="7269439">Both of them admitted first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.021" offset="7275499">And both of them denied the third crucial element in Ritter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.484" offset="7289292">And the evidence on that third disputed element at trial was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.837" offset="7310712">Beck admitted that he was 12 years older than Clements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.839" offset="7326699">Beck admitted that it was he who drove to and from the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.422" offset="7341014">Beck admitted that it was he who disposed of the victims' wallet and purse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.243" offset="7360345">Beck also admitted that he held the victim down while the victim's throat was being cut.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.334" offset="7888750">So, there was from the undisputed evidence, also the only way Beck could have planned to get away with this robbery was by killing the victim because the victim, Roy Malone, knew Beck on a name basis, knew where he lived and could identify him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.617" offset="7949876">Of course Beck said, "I was planning on going to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.477" offset="7969311">"But the State of Alabama has very good extradition relationships with the State of Florida, and Beck could not have imagined in any way he could have evaded such a serious crime by merely going across the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.027" offset="8007450">So, the overwhelming evidence was that Beck either committed the murder himself, had a particularized intent to do so, or knowingly facilitated or sanctioned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.326" offset="8044648">Nonetheless, as a matter of Alabama state law, because Beck got up and said, "Notwithstanding all the evidence, I deny that I knowingly facilitated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.297" offset="8080593">I facilitated it, yes, but I did not know it, and I deny that I knew that it was going to take place," Alabama law, under the Davis decision specifically cited in that case, says that if there as any evidence barring preclusion, statutory preclusion, if there is any evidence whatever, quote, "however insufficient or lacking in credibility," end of quote, only an entire absence of evidence can you preclude it common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.595" offset="8189785">And because of that, we concede as a matter of Alabama state law that had it not been for the statutory preclusion clause, the instruction would have been given enabling the jury to convict on those lower offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.731" offset="8250284">But now it is important to distinguish between determining that a lesser included offense occurred and convicting on the lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.157" offset="8284035">The Alabama capital punishment statute does not preclude the jury from determining that the defendant was only guilty of a lesser offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.005" offset="8315382">Instead, what the Alabama statute does is preclude them from convicting on that lesser offense and say, "If you determine that he is guilty of only the lesser offense, you acquit him of that higher capital offense."</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.666" offset="9174079">If this Court determines, viewing the statute and its particularities, if this Court determines that the answer to that question is yes, then the preclusion clause is unconstitutional and should in fact be struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.175" offset="9228100">However, if this Court determines that the answer to that crucial question is no, then just as clearly and just as certainly the preclusion clause should be upheld and the statute's validity affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.759" offset="9274389">It is our position that preclusion does not undermine the reasonable doubt standard and does not jeopardize the reliability of fact finding, at least not in the context of Alabama's statute, which has special procedural safeguards, three of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.232" offset="9332276">The first is the requirement that the jury, in its verdict form, fix the penalty of death even though the jury has no role in the sentencing process and the judge and not the jury sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.833" offset="9378670">The requirement that the jury fix the penalty at death -- and no defendant can be convicted of a capital offense in Alabama unless that jury verdict form says, "And we fix the penalty or punishment at death" -- is for the specific purpose of calling upon the jury's historical reluctance and caution, some of which Mr. Justice White mentioned earlier, in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.688" offset="9466128">And the historical evidence we have set out in our brief on pages 17 to 21 shows the jurors in capital cases are extremely reluctant to convict when death appears to be the result.</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.006" offset="11623424">And there is a very strong indication that Alabama did write on a clean slate after Gregg, Proffitt, and Jurek made it clear preclusion was not constitutionally required because in 1977, a year after the '76 cases from this Court, Alabama passed a new criminal code which totally restructured and redefined everything from trespassing to homicide.</text>

            <text syncTime="2915.846" offset="11766784">And we think that evidences that the purpose -- at least as of 1977 and arguably as early as '75 when the statute was originally enacted--was to go beyond the requirements of Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.481" offset="11813282">Otherwise, why would they not have left it in there after this Court made clear in '76 it was not constitutionally required?</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.484" offset="11869288">It is especially important in Alabama statutes because, for example, the verdict form requirement -- that is the way where you insist that the jury proceed as cautiously and as reluctantly as possible to protect the reliability of fact finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.652" offset="13793991">We argue because of those safeguards it will not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.569" offset="13805693">They point to the conviction statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.695" offset="13814157">Ninety-six percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.336" offset="13820740">"My goodness, how can you say innocent men are not being convicted wrongfully?</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.350" offset="13836727">Ninety-six percent."</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.251" offset="13844355">The whole point in that is that preclusion, as this Court recognized in Keeble, was for the purpose of protecting -- historically was for the purpose of protecting the prosecutor, not the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.768" offset="13894405">And any prosecutor who knows he does not have the protection of lesser included offenses because of that preclusion clause is going to be extremely reluctant and extremely hesitant to bring any case as a capital case unless he is absolutely certain that not only is the man guilty, but he can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Klingsberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3475.056" offset="14003597">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.394" offset="14016972">The so-called historical evidence which the respondent cites concerning jury's reluctance to convict of a capital crime, based on our reading of the cases in respondent's brief, is only in mandatory capital sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.697" offset="14078203">The implication of the argument is that there should be reduced standards, reduced procedural protections in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.668" offset="14110072">And the Court has consistently said that because of the irreversibility and the absence of any opportunity for correction of error, that there should be greater standards and that there should be greater procedural protections and more reliability in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.944" offset="14179140">Mistrial is not a substitute for the lesser-included-offense procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.799" offset="14202546">This postulates a situation where the jurors would say to each other, "We really think the defendant is guilty only of a lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.564" offset="14237654">So, what we will do is we will go and tell the trial judge that some of us vote to convict, some of us vote to acquit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.097" offset="14263777">Then there will be a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.380" offset="14268897">And then maybe, if the statute does not require it, there will be a reindictment, and maybe that reindictment will be for the lesser offense, and maybe there will be a conviction."</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.355" offset="14304841">That sort of speculation on such a tenuous chain of events cannot be a substitute protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.077" offset="14331695">So far as the interest of the state, which I think is really vital here because we have an interest of the defendant, which is life or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.479" offset="14373282">We have this Court saying in Keeble and other courts saying that there is a substantial risk of interference with the resolution of doubts and fact finding in the event that lesser-included-offense protection is not given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.387" offset="14428871">What is the interest of the state? Respondent says it relates to bias, discretion in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.725" offset="14462307">This has nothing to do with sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.386" offset="14468890">The lesser-included-offense procedure has to do with guilt finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.793" offset="14482578">And where the defendant takes the stand and denies his guilt and then the Court instructs the jury, "You are to find the defendant guilty of a lesser included offense in the event that the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt supports it," that is not bias that is not discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.001" offset="14543391">That is what this Court has said is the controlled, guided exercise of discretion, which is what is suppose to happen in the guilt-finding stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3618.659" offset="14577977">But in the guilt-finding stage, does it not at least tend to eliminate the arbitrariness that was criticized in Furman if the jury is forced to fish or cut bait as to whether this man either committed a capital offense or did not commit it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3634.956" offset="14643179">Not as Furman was subsequently interpreted and clarified in that where the jury is given instructions and told to act on the basis of standards, that is not something which Furman condemned, as the Court indicated in Gregg and the subsequent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.781" offset="14710471">And it is a misinterpretation of Furman, as the Court said in Jurek and Proffitt.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Klingsberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3668.128" offset="14775881">I think that Mr. Justice Stewart, for example, in Gregg, when he was talking about why there should be instructions and why the jury should be guided and standardized on sentencing, said that the reason for that is because that is what juries always are asked to do at the guilt-finding stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.766" offset="14850487">And all of those standards, I think, are adopted and imported into the sentencing stage from traditional standards which are applied at the guilt-finding stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.339" offset="14884760">I think that the state has no interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.887" offset="14894895">Clearly this is something which is a misreading and a misinterpretation of Furman and therefore should be set aside.</text>
