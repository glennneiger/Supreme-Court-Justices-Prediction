            <label>Mr. Miles Curtiss McKee</label>
            <text syncTime="68.176" offset="376038">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please it Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.961" offset="387218">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit Court on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.316" offset="408639">The issue is whether attorneys who multiplied proceedings in an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. 1981 and thereby unreasonably and vexatiously increased the cost, maybe personally assessed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1927, with attorney's fees as part of the excess cost incurred by an opposing party as a result of such conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.497" offset="521383">The case originated in the Western District of Louisiana where it was dismissed without prejudice by reason of the failure of the plaintiffs to answer the defendant's interrogatories and ordered by the Court, the failure of the plaintiff to produce one of the plaintiffs for deposition, the general failure to prosecute the suit and ultimately, the plaintiffs' abandonment of their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.656" offset="613961">The Court after the dismissal and after an evidentiary hearing on the matter of the assessment of cost at which the lawyers for the plaintiffs were represented by their malpractice carrier, the Court awarded fees as cost pursuant to 1927 and under the terms and provisions of Title VII and Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.765" offset="726392">It allowed attorney's fees as part of the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.853" offset="738826">And in the case of Hutto versus Finney decided by this Court in 1978, that taxable cost were equated with attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.321" offset="800684">Our argument to the Court is plain and simple because we're allowed the plain meaning of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.295" offset="824508">And where the plain meaning of the statutes is -- is present, there is no construction necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.604" offset="853765">The Fifth Circuit Court said that you could not combine these statutes, 42 U.S.C. 1988 and Title VII and 1927 on the other hand, that you could not compel them to achieve what the Fifth Circuit called a hybrid result.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.071" offset="935685">The Court of Appeals did this without any explanation, without any discussion of the in pari materia relationship of these statutes and without explaining away the plain language of the statute and without pointing to any absurd, futile or unreasonable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.548" offset="1009560">So where are cost defined for a determination under Section 1927?</text>
            <text syncTime="232.692" offset="1034115">It must rely on other statutes for its definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.639" offset="1049893">And upon which statutes may it rely?</text>
            <text syncTime="239.632" offset="1061909">The United States and the respondents say that it may rely on only two statutes and that's 28 U.S.C. 1920 and 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.787" offset="1110497">They admit that Section 1927 must resort mechanically to other statutes for its definition, but they draw a barrier at the resort to Title VII and Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.967" offset="1159189">The respondent in the amici government don't demonstrate any statutory or other limitation on Section 1927's access to Title VII and Section 1988 for the definition of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.367" offset="1212792">There is nothing in any statute to prohibit this access to these statutes for cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.702" offset="1238183">And neither the respondent, nor the United States or any of the amici in this case assailed the bare language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.744" offset="1270366">Their efforts are devoted to unsubstantiated, unsupported speculation and postulation on which they offer no cases and no authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.682" offset="7738075">My function here today is to emphasize the Government's disagreement with petitioner's reading of Section 1927 which singles out lawyers litigating cases under federal statutes that provide for the recovery of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.340" offset="7800769">And my basic point is that these attorney fee statutes provide for recovery against the opposing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.042" offset="7839535">It distorts their purpose to read them as also approving of recovery against counsel for that party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.488" offset="7873285">The attorney fee provisions in the Civil Rights Act are typical of those in many other federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.894" offset="7898990">They serve two related purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.587" offset="7909752">The first purpose is to encourage private parties to enforce important federal policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.845" offset="7934725">That's the Private Attorney General principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.087" offset="7947682">The cost of hiring counsel is likely to be a serious problem to victims of employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.462" offset="7973177">But that problem is less serious if successful plaintiffs can recover their counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.351" offset="8000763">That means that the case -- the litigation will essentially pay for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.717" offset="8026258">The -- that makes it attractive from the point of view of lawyers and the Congress recognized that in civil rights cases, it's a problem finding lawyers that were willing to take these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.034" offset="8095535">But if counsel fee -- fees can be paid from -- by the -- by the -- can be recovered by the prevailing party, then the lawyers are more likely to be interested in taking the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.545" offset="8145586">They'd become attractive cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.337" offset="8156766">But if litigating these cases imposes a special risk that's not part of the normal risks of litigating cases in any event, then the cases are unattractive to the lawyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2145.964" offset="8687261">And I think we have to start with the assumption, the lawyers did something the lawyers do not normally do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.641" offset="8705964">And if you have a case in which a plaintiff perhaps named as a class representative or something is relatively unsophisticated and the lawyer persuades the plaintiff to file a totally meritorious -- meritless claim and makes a lot of trouble for the other side and runs up the kind of situation where normally a district judge would say, “The plaintiff ought to be charged with cost.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.555" offset="8789556">Your position really is that they shouldn't recover from anybody because he is the one that stick the innocent plaintiff with him and so you're saying nobody should have to pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.461" offset="8921213">That -- the -- the -- it -- it was also the frivolous case regardless of bad faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="2564.688" offset="10362128">It's a strange result, but on April the 2nd, the Fifth Circuit decided a case called, a panel decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.479" offset="10389295">Decided case called Self versus Self, which is cited on page 4 of our reply brief, in which they've suggested that an award for just such a reason might be made under 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.093" offset="10443734">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, on the question of penal at -- our position is simply that where these statutes are as clear as they are that there is no construction needed and whether you admit even if you admit -- admitted completely that they might be penal that it doesn't change the result that we're contending for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.822" offset="10530670">If you follow the argument of the Government, you must say that Congress was not aware of 1920 or 1923 when it passed the 42 c 1988 or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.281" offset="10592528">And has the effect of ignoring one of the cases that they've cited which is Erlenbaugh decided by the Court in 1972, holding that Congress is presumed to be aware that all previous statutes on the same subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.947" offset="10655117">Or should we presume that Congress was aware of 1920 and 1923 and intended something entirely different by the use of the phrase, “As a part of the cost”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.314" offset="10700675">Congress has from to time used various phrases to define cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.830" offset="10730663">In 17 statutes, they've separated them as cost and attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.113" offset="10747800">In five, they have used the language, “Together with.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.147" offset="10763995">In 21 statutes they have used "cost including attorney's fees" and in 15 statutes, one of -- the ones that we're involved with today, they used "cost as a part of".</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.108" offset="10807777">The simple meaning of all of these is that these attorney's fees are part of the taxable cost in these cases in Hutto and Finney, foreclosed any further discussion of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2695.239" offset="10884368">And that is that it's a very mechanistic argument which divides the lawyer and his client and which divides the suit into two parts.</text>
