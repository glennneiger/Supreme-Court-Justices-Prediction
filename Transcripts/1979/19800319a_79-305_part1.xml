            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="59.435" offset="341138">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.139" offset="355976">This case is here on writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, reversing respondent's convictions for possession and importation of cocaine on the ground that respondent's trial testimony was improperly impeached by the use of illegally seized evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.609" offset="437791">On October 2nd, 1977, respondent's coconspirator, McLeroth, a fellow attorney from Fort Wayne, Indiana, was apprehended by customs at the Miami Airport in possession of approximately three and a half pounds of cocaine, which was hidden in pockets sewn into a T-shirt.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.226" offset="524309">Upon being questioned, McLeroth implicated respondent who had arrived in Miami with him on the same flight from Peru and had already cleared customs.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.333" offset="564746">Respondent was located by the agents and arrested and his luggage was seized and searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.099" offset="587734">It contained a T-shirt from which material was missing that correspondent to the material used in making the pockets in McLeroth's shirt, in which the cocaine was secreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.507" offset="629426">On respondent's pre -- pretrial motion, the District Court suppressed the T-shirt as the fruit of an illegal warrantless search of respondent's luggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.188" offset="668087">Now, McLeroth testified as the principal prosecution witness at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.641" offset="685955">He recounted several trips that he and respondent had made to Peru for the purpose of procuring cocaine and he described respondent's role in preparing the pocketed T-shirt for use in the smuggling venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.501" offset="733393">With regard to the ill-fated trip that culminated in their arrest, he described respondent's actions in procuring the cocaine in Peru and secreting it in the shirt.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.636" offset="781876">Respondent testified in his own defense and he denied any involvement in the cocaine smuggling.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.545" offset="809566">In the course of his direct testimony, the following colloquy occurred which appears at page 34 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.080" offset="839659">Question, “And you heard Mr. McLeroth testify earlier as to something to the effect that this material was taped or draped around his body and so on, you heard that testimony?”</text>
            <text syncTime="193.644" offset="877902">“Yes, I did.”</text>
            <text syncTime="195.265" offset="884381">Question, “Did you ever engage in that kind of activity with Mr. McLeroth and Augusto or Mr. McLeroth and anyone else on that fourth visit to Lima, Peru?”</text>
            <text syncTime="203.927" offset="919071">“I did not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="206.736" offset="930356">On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the following question which appears on page 35 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.316" offset="960658">“Now, on direct examination, sir, you testified that on the fourth trip, you had absolutely nothing to do with the wrapping of any bandages or T-shirts or anything involving Mr. McLeroth, is that correct?”</text>
            <text syncTime="224.823" offset="1002663">Answer, “I don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.139" offset="1007888">I said I had nothing to do with any wrapping or bandages or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.166" offset="1024084">I had nothing to do with anything with Mr. McLeroth in connection with this cocaine matter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="235.170" offset="1044041">And further down, toward the bottom of the page, he was asked, “Your testimony is that you had nothing to do with the sewing of the cotton swatches to make the pockets of that tee shirt?”</text>
            <text syncTime="244.685" offset="1082075">Answer, “Absolutely not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="247.846" offset="1094719">And when it became clear that the prosecutor intended to pursue the subject of the shirt found in respondent's luggage, a bench conference was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.290" offset="1128573">The Court concluded that it would permit questioning about the shirt for impeachment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.214" offset="1148217">If respondent admitted that the shirt was in his luggage that would be the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.987" offset="1167339">But if he denied it, impeachment of his denial would be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.730" offset="1186252">Respondent did in fact deny any knowledge that the shirt had been in his luggage.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.815" offset="3062680">The way we would look at the case is to ask the question whether cross-examination on this point was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.601" offset="3089742">If cross-examination on the point was proper, it is our view that the Government is entitled to conduct that cross-examination and the defendant is obliged to submit to it and that that is well settled by the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.211" offset="3140211">And if he then lies in response to the cross-examination, then the Government is entitled to impeach.</text>

            <text syncTime="2685.869" offset="10846856">First, while we've -- I've discussed the matter of the alleged perjury, the Government, of course, has maintained throughout in its principal brief that the reason that Agnello needs to be overruled is to protect the trial process from perjury by the defendant on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.511" offset="10909445">And they stoutly insist throughout their principle brief that that's clearly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.359" offset="10928776">I think a fair reading of the evidence demonstrates that it's not perjury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.071" offset="11091675">In other words, the Government takes the position that it needs this extraordinary remedy in order to curtail or prevent perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.392" offset="11120933">And that's what they talk about in their principle brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.251" offset="11128351">And then when they filed their reply brief, after we had taken the task to some extent, they say “Well, maybe it was just a matter of credibility and we ought to be permitted to do it anyway.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.716" offset="11170252">And it's our position that that simply impeaching someone or -- or attacking their credibility in some particular maybe appropriate, but it doesn't justify doing a way with their Fourth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.065" offset="11219675">Pursuing a point that Mr. Justice Marshall raised and of course, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit saw this very clearly, when it said as -- as we quote in our brief, “According to the view of the trial judge and the prosecutor, the defendant could be asked on cross-examination a question which answered affirmatively, would admit the incriminating tendencies of illegal evidence and answered negatively, would allow the subsequent introduction of the illegal evidence for the purposes of impeachment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.808" offset="11326568">What the Government is really asking this Court to do by overruling Agnello is to do away with the Fourth Amendment right of any defendant who would like to testify on his own behalf.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.837" offset="13266735">For example, in Agnello, there, they were -- they did not offer the physical evidence because I presume it had long since been destroyed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.286" offset="13392541">But I think if you read the transcript, you'll see the trial counsel there was confronted with a typical dilemma and that is that as soon as the T-shirt is mentioned, if he pops up in front of the jury and makes an objection, immediately, he's highlighted that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.058" offset="13455653">And the jury concludes either if he's successful that he's kept something out that he shouldn't have or if he's unsuccessful, he's highlighted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.944" offset="13479163">What he did was to ask to approach the bench as soon as he could gracefully do so and he did raise it then in the bench conference.</text>
