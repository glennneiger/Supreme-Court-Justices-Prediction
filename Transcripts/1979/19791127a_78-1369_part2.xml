            <text syncTime="19.927" offset="183045">I argue here on behalf of the intervenor schools, four of which are religiously affiliated.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.661" offset="206033">I'd like to say one thing in the beginning, with respect to the statement that Mr. Pfeffer made to the effect that these schools discriminate in admissions against persons not of their religious faiths.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.805" offset="258591">The four religiously affiliated schools have each executed answers to plaintiffs' interrogatories, answer # 5, denying that they imposed religious restrictions or preferences on admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.895" offset="306970">I think that that is borne out at least as to the Roman Catholic schools, by the fact that in Manhattan, in the elementary schools conducted by the Archdiocese of New York in Manhattan, 16-1/2 percent of the children in those schools are non-Catholic.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.891" offset="382934">And there are various other statistics for other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.933" offset="395055">But I think at least the schools in New York take great pride in the fact that, far from discriminating against non-Catholics inadmissions, they have consciously kept open schools in inner city core areas, where the population of Catholics has declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.820" offset="482617">They have kept those schools open, and they have taken care, in an educational sense, of significant numbers of non-Catholics.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.036" offset="955538">Getting back to this program, and I don't want to go over again what Mrs. Siegel has said, but I think it is worthwhile talking a little bit about just what this program is.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.194" offset="1012172">First of all, it involves attendance-keeping and reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.237" offset="1032338">This is required by the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.845" offset="1042787">This is not something the schools do on a voluntary basis, or they very well might.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.854" offset="1062745">But it is required, to insure compliance with the compulsory education law of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.847" offset="1086777">The people who keep these records, or compile these records--and this is based on the stipulation of fact which is a part of the appendix--the people who compile these records are typically secretaries in the main office or the front office of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.584" offset="1153755">They are not people who have anything to do with the education or the instructional function.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.636" offset="1173922">They are simply counting heads on a daily basis to be able to make the reports that are required by the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.840" offset="1770768">But getting back to what this statute does, apart from attendance, it provides for various testing--standardized, state-prepared tests, which are prepared by the Department of Education for the State of New York to be made available to public and non public schools, they are the same tests but are made available used in the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.601" offset="1889782">These basically involve several types of tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.253" offset="1908381">The Regents scholership examinations which are given to persons seeking New York state Regents examination at the end of high school, these are prepared by and graded by the personnel of the New York state education department.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.192" offset="1972120">The only thing that the schools do, the non public schools do it would be to recieve the test under very secure circumstances sealed kept in under lock and key distribute those tests at the place of testing, pick them up send the test back to and I suppose people order in the class room.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.735" offset="2066265">We also have the people evaluation progragm, the PEP, and that is the test that is given I think in third, perhaps sixth and ninth grade to measure confidence in reading and mathamatics and is basic, in fact its completely an objective multiple choice type test.</text>
