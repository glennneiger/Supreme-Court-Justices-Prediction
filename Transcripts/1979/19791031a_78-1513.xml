            <text syncTime="24.380" offset="200913">This case is here on appeal by the Government from a judgment of Court of Claims, requiring a payment of survivorship benefits to two illegitimate children of a deceased federal employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.904" offset="250964">The Court of Claims found the children were entitled to payment even though they weren’t -- could not meet the eligibility requirements of the Civil Service Retirement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.590" offset="289729">It relied upon its decision in a previous case in in which it concluded that the statutory requirement denied equal protection to illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.814" offset="326614">The Government contends here first that the Court of Claims had no jurisdiction to award benefits in this case and second, that in any event, the statutory requirement is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.195" offset="376142">George Isaacson was a federal employee when he was killed in an automobile accident in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.135" offset="403937">He was unmarried, but he was survived by two illegitimate children, Shawn and Tricia Clark, who are represented by the appellee here.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.477" offset="441240">Isaacson had recognized them and was subject to a court order requiring him to make monthly payments for their support.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.121" offset="471855">Although he had lived with them for a few years, he had stopped living with them more than two years before his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.372" offset="500903">The Clark children applied for benefits under the Civil Service Retirement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.924" offset="523055">That Act provides for the payment of monthly benefits to the surviving children of covered federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.808" offset="558582">The statute defines a child to include adopted children, as well as, stepchildren and recognized natural children who lived with a wage earner in a regular parent-child relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.023" offset="623470">The Civil Service Commission and the Office of Personnel Management which is a successor of this Commission have consistently interpreted the statute as denying benefits to stepchildren and to illegitimate children who were not living with the employee when he died.</text>

            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="291.124" offset="1267858">Well, the Commission, it interprets it in an administrative act in paying benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.742" offset="1306311">The Clark children sued in the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act, challenging both the Commission’s interpretation of the Act and its constitutionality as so interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.217" offset="1348211">They argued first that they were entitled to benefits under the Act because they had once lived with Isaacson.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.963" offset="1371199">Alternatively, they argued that the Act as interpreted by the Commission denied them equal protection because they could not qualify for benefits by proving that they were actually dependent on their father.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.819" offset="1422608">After this suit was filed, but before it was decided by the Court of Claims, that court decided another case challenging the “lived with” requirement in the Civil Service Retirement Act, that case was Gentry versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.062" offset="1475584">Gentry involved a child who had never lived with the federal employee, and the court in that case found that the statutory requirement was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.537" offset="1513514">So when it decided this case, the Court of Claims followed Gentry.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.824" offset="1534621">The Government didn’t seek to ask -- didn’t ask this Court to review this decision in Gentry because we lost track of it after the Court of Claims remanded the case for further findings by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.507" offset="1577357">We learned of the entry of the final judgment only a few days before our time to petition for certiorari expired and substantially after the time for a note on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.491" offset="1617377">By that time, we knew that the Clark case and others were coming along and that the Commission was working on legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.893" offset="1646947">In November of 1977, the District Court for the District of Columbia decided Proctor versus United States and enjoined the Commission from applying a “lived with” requirement to illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.338" offset="1696684">So, the Commission began paying benefits under that order from and after December 1, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.044" offset="1727509">Finally, in the only class action so far, Jenkins versus the Office of Personnel Management, the District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the Office of Personnel Management to pay benefits retroactively to February 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.051" offset="1791561">That order imposed a much heavier burden on the resources of the retirement fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.684" offset="1814131">That factor, plus the importance of the retroactivity question for other federal benefit programs has led to our decision to seek review in this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.865" offset="1862823">I propose to focus today on the question of whether the Court of Claims had jurisdiction to decide this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.571" offset="2193638">The purpose of the statute is to replace the support that was lost when the wage earner died, and the “lived with” requirement as interpreted by the agency and is that the time when the support was lost was at the wage earner’s death for children who are living with the wage earner at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.953" offset="2299173">If they stopped living with the wage earner as the Clark children did several years previously, that is the point at which the statute assumes the support was lost.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.286" offset="7464521">The two federal employees involved in this case, one was the father, Mr. Isaacson; the other was the lady involved, Ms. Patricia Aileen Clark, both worked for the Veterans Administration at Fort Harrison, Montana and they commenced to live together in 1965 and early 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.207" offset="7548217">And during the period of time they lived together, they had two children, Shawn Clark and Tricia Clark and they continued to live together with the children in a regular husband-wife, parent-child relationship for the world to know, through 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.540" offset="7621569">In 1971, Mr. Isaacson moved out of the common dwelling and Mrs. Clark brought a paternity action in the Court in Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2432.088" offset="9831737">So, by making the “lived with” requirement alone, the test is the equivalent of striking most illegitimates’ ability to recover under the statute at all and I think that is what made five courts in the federal system, two of them three-judge courts declare the statute uniformly unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.809" offset="9914598">Some of the questions, Your Honors have asked, make it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.340" offset="9928704">A federal employee for example who did want to live with the child, who is assigned to Saudi Arabia in his government job, would be over there, the child would be here with the mother, not eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.891" offset="9974888">A Government employee who has no home, who travels all the time, the child lives with the mother, no ability for the child to recover the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.729" offset="10018252">In other cases, where the parents lived together for a long period of time, 10 years, 12 years, and then the father suddenly moves out in spat with the mother, no ability for the child to recover because he can’t show he was physically living with the child at the moment of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.848" offset="10086797">Now, the Government says, children can protect themselves against that, that they can insist that they lived with the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.357" offset="10116786">Well, here is a three-year old child, a six-year old child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.136" offset="10127966">“Mother, I insist on living with my father to protect my federal annuity” or “Father, I insist on you letting me move in with you to protect my federal annuity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.587" offset="10177703">That’s what the Government is asking us to do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.584" offset="10193690">Your Honors, as far as the statute itself is clearly enacted by Congress to protect dependents who are looking to the deceased employee for support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.457" offset="10241233">In this case, we have the order of a Montana Court decreeing support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.050" offset="10263594">We have the support being made throughout the employee’s life right up to his death through allotments out of his federal salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.533" offset="10301524">So, there is no guess work on the part of the Government as to whether he was supporting the children, it came from his salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.423" offset="10325034">Then we have the father in the life insurance policy, the federal group life insurance policy paying after death for the support of the children and yet they have been denied the benefits in this case on the ground that they simply did not physically lived with him at the moment of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.556" offset="10405595">The Government says, perhaps spurious claims are prevented by this sort of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.391" offset="10432972">Well, let’s take the case that is so well-known today of young women moving in with a federal employee, let's say, bringing in a small child that she had from some other relationship and then the federal employee dies, so the mother says, “chance for our federal annuity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.334" offset="10528684">This child was the federal employee’s child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.899" offset="10550941">We were living with him at the time of his death and therefore, I want the annuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.593" offset="10573720">Under the statute, that is all she'd have to say, if she is willing to lie because then she could show they were living together in regular parent-child relationship.</text>
