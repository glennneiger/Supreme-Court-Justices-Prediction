            <text syncTime="68.342" offset="376769">This case is here on certiorari to the Second Circuit which denied enforcement in the Board's order requiring Yeshiva University to bargain with the union and Yeshiva University Faculty Association which following a Board election had been certified as the bargaining representative of the university's full-time faculty members.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.545" offset="477602">The question presented is whether a university's faculty members who participate in decision-making regarding the hiring, termination and promotion of faculty and the academic standards of the university are managerial or supervisory employees and thus exempt from the coverage of the National Labor Relations Act, as the Court of Appeals found, or merely professional employees who are protected by the act, as the Board held.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.429" offset="645099">There is no question that the faculty are professional employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.472" offset="665266">The question is whether they are also managerial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="145.539" offset="685537">Yeshiva University is a private educational institution chartered by the State of New York, facilities located on four campuses in New York City, has approximately 2,500 full and part-time students that attend schools involved in this proceeding, and those schools have approximately 209 full-time and 150 part-time faculty members.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.025" offset="807476">The ultimate policy and decision-making body is the Board of Trustees on which no faculty members sit.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.603" offset="849795">The university President, who is the chief executive officer of the university, is a member of the Board of Trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.051" offset="879574">The next stratum of the administration consists of the Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs, Business Affairs and Student Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.124" offset="919907">The chief administrative officer of each of the schools is the dean or director who serves as the liaison officer between the programmatic activities of the school and the central administration and reports and is responsible to the academic vice president and the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.211" offset="1008201">And there is an Executive Council of the university whose members are appointed by the president, with the concurrence of the Board of Trustees, which consists of the deans of the various schools and the directors of the various administrative divisions of the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.407" offset="1081031">The administration also has various committees, including a budget committee which is appointed by the President and consists of the Vice President for Business Affairs, the Registrar and the Dean of one of the colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.000" offset="1143411">The budget committee establishes guidelines which are followed by the deans and directors of the various schools in drafting their budgets.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.011" offset="1183431">The draft budgets are then submitted to the Vice President for Business Affairs who reviews them with the budget committee and then submits them to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.640" offset="1221883">Now, paralleling this administrative or bureaucratic structure is a structure of faculty committees, councils and assemblies which enables the faculty members to share in the governments of the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.451" offset="1293145">Thus the faculty members of the various schools exercise considerable discretion in determining their own curriculum, the grading system, admission and matriculation standards, and course schedules.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="311.723" offset="1350301">Mr. Come, does it vary somewhat among the schools?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="315.356" offset="1364825">It does vary to some extent, but in general this is the picture and the picture that the Board found is typical of most other universities and colleges.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="329.487" offset="1421354">When you say "their own curriculum," you mean the curriculum that the faculty teaches the students, I take it?</text>

          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="336.627" stopTime="382.027">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="336.627" offset="1449880">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.202" offset="1464195">They also make recommendations --talking about the faculty now -- which are often accepted, regarding the hiring, reappointment and termination, promotion and tenure of other faculty members.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.683" offset="1530128">Now, the court below acknowledged that, as I said before, university faculty members were professional employees within the meaning of 221 of the act and as an incident of that professionalism they could determine the contents of the course and the methods of teaching it and the evaluation of the students' academic performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.632" offset="1629915">The court --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="382.027" offset="1631483">That is, each faculty member with respect to his own course and his own students?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="387.887" stopTime="389.848">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="387.887" offset="1654888">But that alone didn't make them managerial.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="389.848" stopTime="588.513">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="389.848" offset="1662725">That did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.054" offset="1667636">But in the court's view, when the faculty members go beyond that, as they did here, and exercised the additional powers that I have alluded to, they were no longer simply exercising professional expertise but really were substantially and pervasively operating the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.469" offset="1757288">Now, we submit that the court below failed adequately to analyze the basis for the act's exclusion of managerial and supervisory employees and to distinguish between the faculty's influence over matters of professional concern and its actual formal bureaucratic authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.330" offset="1844642">Supervisors, as this Court is aware, are exempt from the National Labor Relations Act and they are defined as persons who exercise authority over employees in the interest of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.015" offset="1911411">The Senate report refers to them as persons who are traditionally regarded as part of management as opposed to rank and file employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.550" offset="1953520">Similarly, managerial employees, as this Court held in Aerospace several years ago, likewise are exempt from the act and they are defined as executives who formulate and effectuate management policies by expressing and making operative the decisions of their employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.903" offset="2046934">Like supervisors, managerial employees are recognized by their alliance with management as opposed to the rank and file employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.855" offset="2090820">Now, at the same time that it exempted supervisory and managerial employees, Congress continued the coverage of professional employees who are defined in section 212 of the act as those who exercise discretion and judgment in the exercise of their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.682" offset="2174098">And although many professional employees are asked for their advice on many important policy questions, they do not become managerial employees merely because their advice has an important influence on the conduct, the ultimate conduct of the enterprise or the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.431" offset="2269080">It is necessary to show, as this Court pointed out in the Bell Aerospace opinion, that professional employees were acting as representatives of management and implementing management policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.131" offset="2343894">And the reason for this requirement is that there is attention in the act between the exclusion of managerial and supervisory employees and the inclusion of professionals, and you have to accommodate them, the two in such a way that one does not engulf the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.513" offset="2457475">Of course, the real difficulty in this case is more fundamental, isn't it, Mr. Come?</text>
            <text syncTime="592.098" offset="2471790">It is the difficulty that is reflected by the rather procrustean effort of transferring the application of this statute, which is tailored to meet the paradigm industrial or commercial setting to an academic institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.004" offset="3599339">The exemptions are very limited and they do not exclude colleges and universities, but it is not even that hard because in 1974, when Congress amended the statute to take out the exemption for nonprofit hospitals, one of the basic reasons why Congress did that was that it found that there was no justification for continuing to exclude that limited category of nonprofit institutions and they took note of the fact that the Board had over the years as a result of the increased impact of colleges and universities on interstate commerce, had been asserting jurisdiction over colleges and universities.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.516" offset="3845413">So I think that we do have indication here that Congress was aware of the fact that the Board had been interpreting the act to apply to colleges and universities and was asserting jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.372" offset="4720828">Of course, joining the argument of my colleague, Mr. Come, I state the issue of this case as to whether the nature of the authority of the faculty may exercise warrants their exclusion under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.950" offset="4787179">As Mr. Justice Stewart indicated, it is indeed a procrustean problem in the application of the statute, but it's a problem whose solution goes to an understanding of what the supervisory and managerial exclusions are based upon, and that is in the legislative history the repeated statement of the Congress to protect the employers from the conflict of loyalty of those representatives who should be loyal first to management and secondly to maintain a balance of power in the collective bargaining relationship between those employees in bargaining with the employer and its management representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.186" offset="4972126">In this respect, I should note, again in response to Mr. Justice Stewart, that when Congress acted in 1974 in amending the statute with the health care amendments, the National Labor Relations Board had decided in 1971 and in 1972 the Adelphi decision and the C. W. Post decision which first dealt with the inclusion of faculty under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.967" offset="5063241">In fact, as our brief indicates, these cases were brought up before the congressional committees and before the Congress in their consideration of that legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.715" offset="7154186">We all seem attracted by the procrustean myth and the procrustean fit, even those of us who can't say it, and I want to say briefly on that subject that we share our friend's view that the act is not a comfortable fit, but we take the position that as nearly as it could be fitted, if you take the principles of the Board's decisions from the industrial area and the commercial area in determining who is managerial and who is supervisory, then it would follow a fortiori that the faculty of a General Motors type university is certainly within both of those categories and outside of the definition of employee for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.765" offset="7390438">It has been said in the discussion of this subject that times have changed since the Middle Ages when scholars came together to think collegially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.762" offset="7450415">Of course, we all agree on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.867" offset="7462849">But in the sense that it is pertinent here and on the basis of the authorities from the academy on which our friends for the petitioners rely, times have not changed significantly at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.987" offset="7531290">The American Association for Higher Education in an important document called, importantly, "Faculty Participation in Academic Governance," which we think really means management, said in the most fundamental sense the university is the faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.707" offset="7626167">And in the same footnote in our brief where we quote that report, Mr. Bundy, who had some contact with schools, said when it comes to a crunch in a first class university, it is the faculty which decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.627" offset="7693876">Now, Mr. Shechtman has said that the faculty decides -- and this is undisputed on this record -- in the sense that its decisions on curriculum, on hiring, promotions, tenure and the other fundamentals are almost always followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.021" offset="7763466">He says the faculty decides because the university chooses to let them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.135" offset="7791888">My suggestion with deference is that thought is without serious meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.834" offset="7818742">It is always true of an organization that those who have the effective power of decision have it because those who might take it away choose to have it reside where it resides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.226" offset="7876315">This record and the literature on both sides cite on the briefs reflect that universities that choose to be distinguished or seek to be distinguished don't let faculties decide merely out of generosity or on sufferance but because first class faculties would not stay there unless their interests were being heard, in having their positions on governance followed or respected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.309" offset="8372642">The Board has struggled heroically with what it has found to be a very difficult subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.123" offset="8407855">But for all the laboring, it has brought forth very little.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.628" offset="8421857">It has said those words, the faculty acts in its own interests rather than in the interest of the university, but it has failed to tell us what that could mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.007" offset="8479431">And I think with respect to the difficulty with fellow counsel, there may have been some difficulty in answering Your Honor's inquiry as to where you could look in this record to find out why and how the faculty is acting in its own interests rather than in the interest of the university when it says such an such course requirements ought to be added to the degree given by the college, or we need a good person in romance languages to shore up the Yeshiva College program, or we ought to give tenure to "X" or promote "Y" or regrettably we ought not to reappoint "Z."</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.745" offset="8662392">Now, those things seem to me to be managerial and supervisory decisions of the highest order and they are obeyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.272" offset="8704502">And when you go back to this act and you try to make it fit and you discover what the Board has done in the settings with which it is familiar, you find that all through industry people with much lower level, much more constricted, narrow, confined responsibilities are held to be managerial or supervisory when they merely recommend decisions of the kind that this faculty is making every day in the week, and the Board never said -- and we found looking through our records that this recommendation to promote an employee was made in the employer's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.762" offset="8882448">They say we find that this production scheduler, this section chief, this expeditor or whatever is managerial or supervisory because of what this person does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.256" offset="8936364">And the Board I think quite properly has assumed that what the person does on the job day in and day out is what is meant to be determinative and unless somebody shows otherwise is in the interests of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.983" offset="9007313">Now, the Board in its brief has tried to shore up, to defend this notion of acting in its own interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.009" offset="9063424">I want to say about that, if the Court please, because think it is a matter of some consequence, that this subject which has become central on the argument, as perhaps it should be, is only the second of three propositions stated by the Board in one sentence as the basis for its decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.132" offset="9147852">And that whole rationale is found in a single sentence at page 68a of the appendix to the Board's petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.326" offset="9200724">And the Board there says, acknowledging that the faculty engages in what it calls collegial decision-making, it says, "At Yeshiva University, faculty participation in collegial decision-making is on a collective rather than individual basis."</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.594" offset="9277733">And let me stop over that and say that that notion, if one may respectfully call it that, was the only basis for the Board's first decision holding that faculty members are employees within the meaning of the act, the only basis, and that is the basis given in the C. W. Post case to which reference has been made, and it is a basis, I think it is fair to say, wisely abandoned now by Board counsel and seemingly by the petitioner union as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.029" offset="9423496">So the Board said, proposition one, it is on a collective rather than individual basis, it is exercised in the faculty's own interests rather than in the interests of the employer -- a subject that we have paid a fair amount of attention to that I will call the second proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.375" offset="9492877">And third, final authority rests with the Board of Trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.327" offset="9516701">Now, I think it is also correct to say that that third thought relegated to a footnote in the Board's brief, is also abandoned and I think again soundly abandoned because it has no visible merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.472" offset="9593292">So we are left with the second thought, that the faculty can't be deemed managerial or supervisory because it acts in its own interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.608" offset="9633834">And on that one might argue as a technical matter of the review of an administrative agency's decision, that a three-legged decision of which two legs have been shot away is pretty infirm to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.542" offset="9693497">But in any event, we go to this notion of own interests about which we have been talking, and I want to say some further things about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3044.619" offset="12281814">There is a First Circuit case cited in the briefs in this case involving a school called Wentworth Institute where the faculty worked on one-year contracts where the faculty had a curriculum committee which the First Circuit noted nobody paid any attention to, where the faculty had other committees that confined themselves to things like sporting events, the arrangements for sympathetic gifts to people in the institution who became unwell, and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.050" offset="12435623">And so it was a faculty that did indeed consist of employees who went in and taught, which is a professional task, and perhaps made their course outlines and arranged and managed their own classroom, but did nothing about the running of the institution and were not permitted or expected to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.077" offset="12515662">And I would say that the Board, if it corrected its misconceptions as we see them on this subject, might well place a Wentworth Institute at one end of the spectrum that the NEA talks about --</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.618" offset="13193801">But as has happened, I could be wrong in this, and if Mr. Shechtman's efforts to make this a Universal Camera case is more substantial than we have supposed it to be, then the Court I think would want to reconsider the whole business and decide whether this case belongs here at all -- and I must say on that that a very imperfect cursory scarcely scrutable agency decision with a record where the first time you meet really competent fact findings is in the Court of Appeals rather than in the agency, one might want to conjure that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.752" offset="13358373">Now, I want to approach an end, as I think I must, by saying another thing or two about the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.557" offset="13397556">There has been a lot of talk in the briefs, amicus, opposing our position about questions of policy, as they are put, speaking of the university frequently as if it consisted in some adversary way of a management, so described, meaning I suppose the administration on one side, and a rank and file faculty, a phrase frequently used by the Board, on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.272" offset="13512495">And I suppose most of us would not wish to be on or be taught by something called rank and file faculty, and I don't think it is a conception that is used in this kind of university.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.958" offset="13555231">But passing that, let me say that what is left out of those amicus briefs are interests that are critical in today's university, interests of students, of alumni, of trustees, of eve widening publics that have a focused concern with the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.868" offset="13642794">Those interests are what give point and justification to our notions of academic freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.499" offset="13677380">Whenever academic freedom is mentioned on the briefs, it seems to consist only of freedom of faculty to resist or oppose or be left alone by the administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.880" offset="13722937">It means much more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.141" offset="13731924">Now, those policy questions we believe are mostly not central to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.412" offset="13753031">They were not central to the Board in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.174" offset="13768077">But I do want to say, because I think the setting ought to be clear, that if they were and if this were a question now of legislative policy, we would want to emphasize the view that taken by Sanford Kadish, when he was Professor Kadish, now Dean of -- when he was President of the American Association of University Professors, and when he said in his presidential address, speaking about academic freedom and problems that concern us here, he said the process of collective bargaining raises problems in the university even apart from the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.932" offset="13927111">In dividing the university into worker professors and manager administrators and governing boards, it imperils the premise of shared authority, encourages the polarization in interests and exaggerates the adversary concerns of interests held in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.868" offset="14006836">He went on to say that it causes loss of and peril to the basic conception of the faculty as the primary governor of the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.782" offset="14054484">I want to add that when Archibald Cox, who stood here very often and who prior to that had earned some repute as a student of labor law, sat on a commission to consider the tragic events in 1968 at Columbia, his commission at the end made a report that has become fairly well known, and as part of that report, in a very few words, Mr. Cox and his distinguished colleagues under took to identify what they called the essential quality of the institution, the university, and they said -- and it sounds medieval, but they said in 1968-69, "The university is a community of scholars, both teachers and students."</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.184" offset="14240057">They said more, but I see the read light and I thank You Honors.</text>
