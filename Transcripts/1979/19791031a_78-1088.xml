            <text syncTime="44.828" offset="282728">He is the petitioner in 1088 and the cross-petitioner in 1217.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.164" offset="308015">The material facts in this case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.118" offset="319822">It comes here on a cross motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.787" offset="338526">At the White House and that the State Department, Dr. Kissinger had his secretaries to monitor his telephone conversations, take short hand notes of what was said and prepare rough typewritten summaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.378" offset="396936">The practice was specifically approved for Senior Department officials by State Department policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.356" offset="428805">The purpose was to ease the administrative burdens of office by enabling Dr. Kissinger’s personal aides without further briefing to implement and follow up what was said or what was agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.354" offset="484812">They were used as work aides and it was these follow up actions that produce the records which are presently in the department’s files, aide memoirs, memorandums of telephone conversations, memorandums of the file, other documents which were circulated and filed in the normal course of business in the State Department, and these official records are voluminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.508" offset="585435">The notes themselves were not made or kept as records.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.258" offset="604453">They do not have the form of records.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.437" offset="613125">They were never edited.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.009" offset="619395">They contain omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.598" offset="625768">They are not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.670" offset="634023">They were never circulated outside of Dr. Kissinger’s office.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.166" offset="651995">No one other than Dr. Kissinger and his immediate aides had access to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.048" offset="759515">The notes reflect almost all of Dr. Kissinger’s telephone conversations regardless of content.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.032" offset="795460">They contain notes of both official and personal matters, some important and some of course, inconsequential.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.448" offset="1017187">Both, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.284" offset="1024502">What actually happened in this case is that some of the secretary knew in some cases that were purely personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.446" offset="1053132">In the event that it was a personal telephone call and no record, very personal telephone call, no record was made, but in the normal course, every telephone call by aides, by the President, by whoever it was, the conversation was recorded and the notes were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.353" offset="1124812">These notes were reviewed by Dr. Kissinger, his affidavit is in the record to the effect that there are omissions, inaccuracies in the notes that were taken and there were other omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.371" offset="1204851">Of course, had Dr. Kissinger known that these notes might be viewed as official agency records, he would either have put them in proper form for filing or more likely he would discontinue the practice altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.430" offset="1269112">Now, towards the end of his term, Dr. Kissinger decided to donate both his Harvard papers and the papers he accumulated in government service to the United States and he chose the Library of Congress as the custodian because it has been used as the depository by many other Secretaries of States and as the Government points by a great many other Cabinet officers. The donation process within the department included several steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.497" offset="1381334">Each of which was approved by the Legal Adviser, by the Assistant Secretary for Administration, by the Deputy Undersecretary for Management and by the Director of the Department's Record Center.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.218" offset="1500244">In a memorandum signed by all of these, Dr. Kissinger was advised that his personal files were freely transferable to the library under the department’s regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.716" offset="1550190">Each signer of the memorandum knew that the notes were in Dr. Kissinger’s personal files.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.338" offset="1580701">The legal adviser gave Dr. Kissinger a formal written opinion confirming the previous oral advice that the notes were not State Department agency records.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="380.042" stopTime="385.330">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="380.042" offset="1623542">Mr. Ginsburg, is a legal adviser an appointee of the Secretary of State or of the President?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_ginsburg" startTime="385.330" stopTime="546.893">
            <label>Mr. David Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="385.330" offset="1644648">He is appointed by the President, sir and confirmed by the Senate and is a respected member of the bar of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.706" offset="1678190">And in that opinion, the legal adviser considered the agency regulations, government practice and analogous judicial opinions and he concluded “That these particular papers are personal and may be retained by you when you leave office, but as a precaution, to assure that the Government’s records were complete, the legal adviser recommended that Dr. Kissinger review and make extracts of any discussion of significant policy decisions or actions not otherwise, reflected in the official files” and this was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.416" offset="1840985">Now, Dr. Kissinger donated all of the papers subject to deeds of gift which restrict access to the collection and these restrictions were designed to protect the classified information in the notes and the other records and the privacy rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.461" offset="1913187">The notes will be made available for public access after 25 years, but only with the consent of those who participated in the conversations if they are then still living.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.824" offset="1962715">After the donations were publicly announced and after the notes and the other papers were transferred to the library, the Reporters' Committee filed requests and the Military Audit Project, filed request with the State Department for these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.649" offset="2030007">Both requests were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.673" offset="2042023">Both denials were made by persons then serving Under Secretary Vance.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.712" offset="2070235">The grounds for denial were that the notes were not State Department agency records and that the department in any event did not have them in its custody or control.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.243" offset="2120391">The Military Audit Project and the Reporters' Committee then filed separate freedom of action suits against the State Department and Secretary Vance and named Dr. Kissinger and the Librarian of Congress as defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.774" offset="2182457">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court held that the Freedom of Information Act did not apply to notes of the White House period, but that the State Department period notes where agency records subject to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.144" offset="2243897">The Court then ordered Dr. Kissinger and the Library of Congress to return all the State Department notes to that department for processing and release under the Freedom Information Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.890" offset="2302934">The librarian was named as a party to the action, although of course, he is not an agency under the Freedom of Information Act and of course, neither is Dr. Kissinger as an individual, but the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.482" offset="2361344">So that as we see it the central issue in this case is whether the Freedom of Information Act gives the Military Audit Project and the Reporters' Committee a right of access to documents which the State Department has specifically determined were not its records before any requests for them were filed and records which it does not have and cannot produce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3287.006" offset="13251375">In this case the Secretary of the State chose to record and communicate to his aides the conduct of his office in part by causing the preparation of verbatim transcripts of his business telephone conversations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.872" offset="13414902">When the State Department denied the records on January 18 and that is the date which I ask the Court to remember.</text>

            <text syncTime="3356.443" offset="13529109">That denial, we submit and I will present my theory with respect to that, was a withholding within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act, on that basis there was a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.234" offset="13584280">The cause of action arose under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3427.169" offset="13812067">The point is that the Secretary of State categorically denied him access to these records, claiming that they were personal records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.695" offset="13854177">I will argue the question of the District Court’s power and the question of the cause of action, Mr. Sussman will argue the question of whether the records are agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.996" offset="13899316">I would only say here that we agree with the concession made by the Solicitor General that they were agency records in their inception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.058" offset="13935574">We disagree with him when he says that they could at a later date or did at a later date not become lose that character as agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.640" offset="13977893">I refer to January 18 and I told the Court what happened on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.325" offset="13996701">The petitioner was still the Secretary of State on January 18, and it was in his capacity as Secretary of State that the department under his supervision, under his supervision by statute denied access to these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.738" offset="14066291">The denials were based on the claim that they were his personal property, his refusal of access to the Archivist was based on the claim that they were his personal property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3502.633" offset="14113938">With respect to the Archivist, that was the only basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.648" offset="14125955">With respect to the Freedom of Information request the additional basis was that he had already transmitted them to the Library of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.566" offset="14161586">We start with the proposition that when a Federal government official acts in performing the duties of his office, he is presumed to act for the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.033" offset="14215502">The petitioner was Secretary of State and not acting as a private individual, and everything at issue here occurred when he created the records, when he caused them to be written down, when he preserved them, and he preserved them, he thought that they were appropriate for preservation and in so doing I think he was acting for the agency of which he was the agent and for which he was a fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.841" offset="14310693">It was a Secretary of State that the agency denied the first Freedom of Information request for these documents, and it was a Secretary of State that he by statue had custody of the department's records, that prima facie these records were State Department records at all times that he was Secretary of State and insofar as he purported to transfer them to the Library of Congress, they remained nevertheless the property of the Department of State through the constructive possession, a phrase used by Mr. Geller earlier in the Forsham case, the Government accepts constructive possession, through the constructive possession of Secretary Kissinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.028" offset="14491460">Accordingly, very simply, these documents remained in the possession and in the control of the Department of State at the time when both Freedom of Information requests were filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3641.235" offset="14668361">By the description of these records, however, as the Solicitor General says, they were agency records and all flows from that in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.784" offset="14714546">The conversations, after all, were not held with Mrs. Kissinger, they were held with Presidents, they were held with foreign ambassadors, they were held with other officials of the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.465" offset="14753207">They were circulated to Dr. Kissinger's immediate aides, as Dr. Kissinger's lawyer here has told us, for the purpose of implementing and following up the determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.394" offset="14796988">There is no way in which these could be anything other than agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.995" offset="14819349">Now, our position is that as Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger had a duty to his principal, the Department of State, not to prefer his own personal interests to his principal's interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.500" offset="14873370">He was aware from the very beginning, from January of 1976, when the first Freedom of Information Act for any of the records, those in that case White House records, were submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.046" offset="14915584">That there was a question as to whether or not these documents were agency records or were personal files.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.850" offset="14938781">Nevertheless, he made the determination, a determination which we submit was in conflict with the interest, an interest he was aware of, of the agency that they were his records and not the agency's records.</text>

            <text syncTime="4159.024" offset="16739453">We would say and I think this case illustrates it quite plainly that if an agency owns a document, it has a legal right to reduce that document to possession at any time.</text>

            <text syncTime="4921.434" offset="19789093">Let me turn first to the definition of records in the records statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.176" offset="19832038">We have a rather fundamental and direct quarrel with both the Government and with Mr. Kissinger on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.289" offset="19868505">They make the argument that individual agencies have broad discretion under the Records Acts to determine when documents concededly relating to public business are records and when they are non-records.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.447" offset="19929109">We don't think that it is logical or sensible to adopt that reading of the records statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.703" offset="19962232">Our reason is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.120" offset="19971845">The records statute contains a very detailed, a very specific procedure for transferring documents relating to public business from public to private custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.482" offset="20025344">The agency must list those documents on a schedule, submit it to the Archivist, and it must determine before it lists those documents on the schedule that the documents have no longer use for the current transaction of government business and they have no long-term value either to other agencies of the government, to the government as a whole or to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.991" offset="20131297">Now, the interpretation of the Records Act proposed by the government would allow an individual agency by the simple expedient of classifying a document as a non-record material to exclude it entirely from the archival process, in which case the careful, detailed, uniform, and consistent scheme adopted by Congress for making archival decisions would be bypassed completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.639" offset="20253968">With that, I would like to close.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.534" offset="20261491">I think that that is a compelling reason in and of itself why the interpretation of the Act offered by the Government should not be accepted.</text>

            <text syncTime="5093.260" offset="20476426">I make the simple point that if they are non-record materials, then of course they are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act which applies only to records.</text>
            <text syncTime="5103.099" offset="20515819">This is a problem that has to do with the Federal Records Act and not with the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.650" offset="20541942">Now, the implications of the argument that the Court has just heard from the Reporters Committee should be clearly understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.643" offset="20581961">The first, that the claim is that the Freedom of Information Act can be used not only to obtain records in the custody and the possession and in the control of an agency, but as a basis for requiring the return to an agency of materials that it relinquished before the request was made.</text>
