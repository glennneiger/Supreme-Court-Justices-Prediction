            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="17.792" offset="174582">The important thing to remember is that Carey is a Title VII plaintiff because she filed a charge with the EEOC under Title VII and was required by Title VII to go to the state agency for the relief in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.620" offset="257860">It doesn't follow that the state administrative agency or state courts are enforcing Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.656" offset="294013">They are enforcing the state equal employment law and they are simply within the confines of the state law, so that they are not required by Title VII to award attorneys fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.083" offset="379695">From the point of view of the employee, this is part of her route through the state proceedings on her way to the EEOC and ultimately to a court that has jurisdiction to enforce Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.095" offset="447718">That almost always is going to be a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.170" offset="468093">She will get her right to sue letter, then she has 90 days to go into a court with jurisdiction to enforce Title VII rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.778" offset="506441">Arguably that could be a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.739" offset="526294">We don't believe that the jurisdiction to enforce Title VII is exclusively in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.091" offset="559731">At any rate, she has to get her right to sue letter and before she is in a court with jurisdiction to enforce Title VII.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="123.179" offset="596093">Has that ever been decided?</text>
            <text syncTime="124.798" offset="602572">Has there ever been a Title VII action brought in a state court?</text>

            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="128.110" offset="615842">There are a few cases in state courts holding that there is concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.947" offset="643114">I gather there is also one court saying that there is not, but the majority agree that there is a right to have a state court enforce a Title VII action.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.000" offset="715421">Our fundamental point is that the statute, Title VII, authorizes any court having jurisdiction over a Title VII action to award attorneys fees for proceedings under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.594" offset="777697">The state proceedings here were under Title VII because the employee was required to resort to them under that statutory scheme, and for that reason she is entitled to attorneys fees for those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.113" offset="855855">The only other point that I wanted to make is that it really makes no sense to penalize a victim of employment discrimination simply because she happens to live in a deferral state and therefore has to go to the state agency first.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.056" offset="1091584">That's right, it does but, on the other hand, this Court has emphasized that when the statute says may give it, it means that she is entitled absent specific circumstances indicating that such an award would be unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.363" offset="1156786">So you are right, it is not a statutory right.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.397" offset="1452910">Just a few words if I may, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.683" offset="1474121">I think the concept that the federal and state statutes are integrated is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.002" offset="1503378">Senator Dirksen and Senator Humphrey were the cosponsors of the state deferral section.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.990" offset="1527306">The course of the debates on this section, Senator Dirksen said this section was enacted to keep primary exclusive jurisdiction in the hands of the state commission for a sufficient period of time to let them work out their own problems at the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.162" offset="1604002">The federal statute is intended as a standby only in the event that the state system does not work.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.038" offset="1643499">Now, in this particular case, instead of going to the state as the statute mandates, the complainant went to the EEOC and they in turn deferred her to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.125" offset="1711835">The right to sue letter which triggered or necessitated the commencement of the action in the federal court to preserve the plaintiff's rights was solicited by counsel for the plaintiff, and the record contains letters between counsel and EEOC requesting a right to sue letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.720" offset="1846209">I disagree with the position of the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.762" offset="1862405">There was no need ever for Ms. Carey to have a Title VII complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.746" offset="1886333">All the relief that she was entitled to she obtained from the state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.145" offset="1903992">There was no need and, as Judge Werker pointed out below, the right to sue letter issued by the EEOC after the state had awarded affirmative relief and during the time of the appeal was unwise and did not justify the award of attorneys fees in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.035" offset="1987480">Thank you.</text>
