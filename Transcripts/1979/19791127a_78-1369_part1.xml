            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="141.000" offset="667355">This statute covers private schools that are not religiously sponsored, but I have no idea why one of the private schools which are not religious, Horace Mann, has joined in this suit as intervenor.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.743" offset="726392">We do not challenge the constitutionality of this law; this was decided by this Court previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.247" offset="748335">But insofar as non-religious schools are concerned, there's no constitutional barrier to the type of statutes here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.130" offset="783862">The challenge here is exclusively to schools which exclude, and claim the right to exclude under the free exercise clause, persons who are not of their religion to which the school is dedicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.302" offset="844570">The question--specifically, the question presented in this case is the constitutionality under the establishment clause of a state statute providing reimbursement to religious schools for the cause of mandated record-keeping and testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.183" offset="916146">I think there is the prior history of this statute is significant to the determination of the constitutionality of the present statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.615" offset="957837">The prior statute provided for financing by pupil allotment the cost of tests prepared by church schools, which might be used for religious instruction, and which lacked auditing provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.047" offset="1023561">The statute was held unconstitutional by this Court in Levitt v. Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.394" offset="1060968">Then a new statute, providing payment for teachers' services, and conducting State-prepared tests, and in pupil attendance reporting, was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.460" offset="1113213">This was to be on an actual cost, rather than a per pupil allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.325" offset="1136724">The law was held unconstitutional by the district court in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.890" offset="1166921">On appeal, this Court vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for reconsideration in the light of its concurrent decision in Wolman against Walter.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.924" offset="1215091">On remand, the district court held by a vote of 2-1 that while the original decision was correct on the basis of then-existing law, the law from Lemon against Kurtzman through Meek against Pittenger, Wolman, and I quote to you, relaxed some of Meek's constitutional strictures against state aid to sectarian schools, and it revived the more flexible concept that aid to a sectarian' school's educational activity is permissible if it can be shown with a high degree of certainty that the aid will only have a secular value of legitimate interest to the State, and does not present any appreciable risk of being used to aid in the transmission of religious views, end of quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.153" offset="1427937">In its original decision, the Court had held that the statute had a principal and primary effect which advanced religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.362" offset="1464822">And therefore the Court did not find it necessary to pass on the question of whether it's unconstitutionally fostered excessive entanglement with religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.846" offset="1506722">On remand, the majority of the district court held that the statute passed muster here, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.861" offset="1534830">It is our contention that Wolman does not mandate either a more flexible concept in respect to the establishment clause, nor determination upholding the constitutionality of the new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.323" offset="1592613">Specifically as to the latter, we urge that Wolman is clearly distinguishable from the facts, and therefore does not mandate a holding of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.163" offset="1640051">As to the more flexible interpretation of the establishment clause, we urge that the decisions of this Court as to Wolman manifest no intention to overrule sub silentio what has been held in all relevant cases, in 1971 through Meek and thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.759" offset="1726360">Wolman, we submit, is clearly distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.680" offset="1746108">There the Court expressly noted that the Ohio statute [ILLEGIBLE WORDS] did not authorize any payment to non-public school personnel, nor did the non-public school personnel participate in the drafting or scoring of the tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.543" offset="1813504">The Court said in Wolman, and I should like to quote it, "These tests are used to measure the progress of students in secular subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.448" offset="1865122">Non-public school personnel are not involved in either the drafting or the scoring of the tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.679" offset="1898036">The statute does not authorize any payment to non-public school personnel for the costs of administering the tests."</text>
            <text syncTime="455.793" offset="1926562">And what I consider a very significant footnote, footnote 7, the Court said, and again I quote, "No national aid is involved in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.283" offset="1964492">The tests themselves are provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.735" offset="1974314">And further, it does not,"--the statute,--"does not reimburse schools for costs incurred in tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.416" offset="2001063">No money flows to the non-public school or parent."</text>
            <text syncTime="478.857" offset="2018826">And the rest of the quote is in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.230" offset="2044322">In the present case, religious schools are involved in the scoring of the tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.964" offset="2067205">Payment for the services is made, not to an outside secular testing corporation, nor even to the religious school's teaching personnel, but to the religious school itself, which we suggest, represents an even more flagrant violation to the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.867" offset="2142856">Nor as in Wolman is the grading done by an outside secular corporation, but by the personnel of the religious school itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.442" offset="2177128">Testing, I suggest, is universally recognized by educators as being part of the teaching process.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.597" offset="2245778">The thesis which I believe all the decisions of this Court is predicated upon is that if an institution is supported by taxes paid by all, irrespective of their religion, the money so raised cannot be used to finance educational institutions--I don't go beyond that--educational institutions which are closed to some of the taxpayers for no reason other than religion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="574.761" offset="2402408">I think that this Court indicated in Wolman that it was not happy with the decision in respect to textbooks, but it felt bound by the fact that in 1968 the majority of this Court found the loaning of textbooks to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.666" offset="2494046">But--</text>

            <text syncTime="603.834" offset="2518706">But the Court made it quite clear, by its decision in that case, that it was not going to go one inch beyond what it was mandated to do under the basis of stare decisis, by the textbook case.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.531" offset="2565517">In respect to transportation, I think a better case--although I personally do not agree with the decision, nor did five justices who dissented--transportion I think can be justified--</text>

          <turn speaker="leo_pfeffer" startTime="628.441" stopTime="694.215">
            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="628.441" offset="2617135">Four justices; four justices dissented, sorry; it was a 5-4 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.694" offset="2658200">That in the Everson case, the bus transportation case, I think a reasonable case can made for the argument that this is like medical and dental lunches, a welfare rather than an educational expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.868" offset="2734895">And in respect to welfare, health, and so on, exclusion of pupils in parochial schools would probably violate the equal protection clause; might--might violate it.</text>

            <text syncTime="713.411" offset="2957040">Well, from my viewpoint, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.786" offset="2970520">But it has at least some defensibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.832" offset="2990686">I think why it's not significant, important, is because it is a educational service.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.523" offset="3017435">I think the case is more grievous where this educational testing is done by religious teachers, and you cannot even, even in the statute here which provides that essay questions are marked, are graded initially--initially by the parochial school personnel, you cannot divorce the personal religious predilections of the tester from the grading of the paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.057" offset="3143555">It just--I don't think a person committed to religion can divide himself into two parts and close his eyes to answers which violate what he believes to be God's word.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.983" offset="3207293">In respect to record-keeping, I come to this now, recall the Court's attention to Walz v. Tax Commission, where it upheld tax exemption for churches on the grounds that non-exemption would have required the government to audit and examine the operations and records of churches, and thus entangle it in their religious affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.809" offset="3290572">The Court said, obviously a direct money subsidy would be a relationship pregnant with involvement, and as with most governmental grant programs, could encompass sustained, detailed administrative relationships for enforcement of statutory or administrative standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.199" offset="3372178">We call this Court's attention to Lemon v. Kurtzman, and Earley v. DiCenso.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.235" offset="3396315">There, the Court struck down statutes providing financial aid to church schools to compensate them for so-called non-ideological services.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.748" offset="3442395">The full quotation is on page 15 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.455" offset="3457233">I respectfully call the Court's attention to the italicized sentences, which I should like to read briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.269" offset="3504462">There, in that case, the Court said - The program requires the government to examine the school's records, in order to determine how much of the total expenditure is attributable to secular education and how much to religious activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.303" offset="3564544">The present statute requires that.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.486" offset="3577292">Then, later on, the Court said - In particular, the government's post audit power to inspect and evaluate the church-related school's financial records, and to determine which expenditures are religious and which are secular creates an intimate and continuing relationship between church and state.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.058" offset="3655555">May I suggest to the Court that if a school hands in a record saying, we spend X hours for taking attendance, and no more, and the amount there indicated for taking attendance is disproportionate to other, public schools, time spent in those schools for record-keeping, there would be an obligation upon the state to inspect and examine how come you spent three times as much time on attendance taking than outside schools?</text>
            <text syncTime="927.372" offset="3812812">That very question, and the obligation of the religious schools to answer that, entangles states in religion; and I think it's constitutionally impermissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.615" offset="4377788">And a particular parochial school sends in a bill to the state that's twice as high as any public a school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.763" offset="4414464">And there answer, when the state questions them as you say they must, is, just that we play twice as many football games as the public schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="1112.795" offset="4554585">And if you could make an arguable case--if you could make an arguable case, that football is so related--I do not agree with it--but if you could make an arguable case that football is so related to the healthiness of the students, I think the Court has ruled in respect to gymnasiums you may not, but in respect--football is so related to the health of the students that it is not part of the educational process; perhaps.</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.124" offset="5123845">Only if--well, if there is no alternative, if the state comes in and determines the amount to be paid to that school on the basis of how many school children are present and how many are not present, whether how many are excused for lawful absence and how many not excused, I think that constitutes an entitlement which, while--which is forbidden by the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.016" offset="5271385">In the broadest sense the other critical issue now before the Court is, we suggest, as a majority held whether--rather the majority held this Court has relaxed some of the Meeks constitutional strictures against state aid to parochial schools; and if it has, were the relaxations of sufficient magnitude to justify the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.825" offset="5374621">And it's to this issue that I will devote the balance of my initial presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.859" offset="5398758">We suggest that the district court was in error in assuming that this Court has retreated from its prior--takes this position in respect to aid to parochial schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.972" offset="5451212">The error of this assumption is manifested in the Court's disposition of three cases which came to it after Wolman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.190" offset="5484126">The first of these was New York v. Cathedral Academy, decided in the same term as Wolman, but after Wolman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.193" offset="5520175">In that case, the Court said that if the challenged statutes authorized payments for the identical services, that ought to be reimbursed under the law held unconstitutional in Levitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.886" offset="5566882">It was invalid for the same reasons that the previous law was held invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.619" offset="5585899">If on the other hand, it empowered the New York Court of Claims to make an independent audit on the basis of which it was to authorize reimbursement for clearly--for the sake of the services, such a detailed inquiry would itself impel impermissible entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.162" offset="5652041">The very inquiry, the very going in there to check constitutes entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.158" offset="5680044">That's what the Court said in Cathedral Academy; it's not less true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.511" offset="5697390">The Court there said, the prospect of church and state litigating about what does or does not have a religious meaning touches the very core of the constitutional guarantee against religious establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.114" offset="5747858">And it cannot be dismissed by saying that it will happen only once.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.904" offset="5770951">The second indication that the Court in Wolman did not intend to water down or retreat from the principles announced in Meek v. Pittenger, is indicated from its opinion this year in NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.456" offset="5829151">There the Court said, and I quote again, only recently we again noted the importance of the teacher's function in a church school, whether the subject is remedial reading, advanced reading, or simply reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.993" offset="5879306">A teacher remains a teacher, and the danger that religious factors will become entwined with secular instruction persists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.453" offset="5917236">And cites Meek v. Pittenger for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.769" offset="5934477">It is, we respectfully submit, not--most unusual for the Court to base its determination on a decision, which as the court below held, it had so recently compromised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.866" offset="5982856">Finally, we should also like to call the Court's position a bare six months ago of the case of Byrne v. Public Funds for Public Schools of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.979" offset="6023293">There the Court summarily affirmed a Court of Appeals decision invalidating a provision in the New Jersey income tax law granting tax benefits to parents who pay tuition for children attending religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.146" offset="6079927">That decision held that under this Court's 1973 in Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, the challenged New Jersey law could not stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.575" offset="6125693">The affirmance in Byrne, we suggest, cannot be easily reconciled with the district court's assumption in the present case, that this Court has retreated from all that it has held, and it has said through the many cases from Levitt to the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.537" offset="6193507">May I conclude with this--conclude with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.875" offset="6202911">These cases are based on the implicit categorical imperative that it is morally wrong, and constitutionally impermissible, to compel all persons, regardless of their religion, to pay taxes used to finance the operations of schools from which some of them are excluded solely because of their religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.907" offset="6306983">I would like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1559.232" offset="6340315">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.412" offset="6357034">The state law that is before you today is simply incidental to an historic and very long-standing state function and responsibility to see that attendance is taken in the schools at the elementary and secondary school level throughout the state, and to see that certain minimum standards of educational achievement are met by administering state-prepared, state-mandated tests at certain levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.210" offset="6480227">The public schools which abide by these identical requirements, are compensated through the rather generous--it's currently running $3.6 billion a year--state aid to the local school districts, and the non-public schools are compensated under this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.244" offset="6572387">When you say "compensated," that non public schools are compensated, are you referring to the--that the non-public school costs of the examination and the attendance record is paid for by the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="shirley_adelson_siegel" startTime="1630.987" stopTime="1724.698">
            <label>Ms. Shirley Adelson Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="1630.987" offset="6627349">By this Act which is before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.675" offset="6638111">Now, the prior act, which had a similar purpose, which was held to be a proper secular purpose by the Court which it decided the Levitt case, was invalidated because of the fact that that act has included reimbursement for teacher-prepared tests which were deemed to be such a part of the overall, integrated teaching process which was part of a religious mission of many of these schools that it permeated and, in effect, poisoned the well for the entire statute, and since they were lump sum payments being made, based on the number of pupils in each school under that act, it is impossible for the Court to disentangle the amount, and to determine just how much of it would go for proper secular purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.709" offset="6838209">And I would like to read the final paragraph of the Court there, which was the basis for the statute which was then promptly adopted by the state and is before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.288" offset="6876557">Since Chapter 138 provides only for a single per-pupil allotment for a variety of specified services, some secular and some potentially religious, neither this Court nor the district court can properly reduce that allotment to an amount corresponding to the actual costs incurred in performing reimbursable secular services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.548" offset="6957537">That is a legislative, not a judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.989" offset="6971329">And so with the adoption of this new statute, the appropriations dropped by from $28 million to $8 million a year, where they're now constant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.745" offset="7298382">They do not discriminate on the basis of students or faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.361" offset="7320848">And in fact such allegations in the complaint were flatly denied by the intervenor-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.817" offset="7346657">Now, the main thrust of the challenge to the new statute is that it does not give substantial direct aid to the sectarian enterprise as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.951" offset="7383228">Yet this Court has rejected the argument in several cases that just the freeing up of private funds to make some money available for sectarian purposes would not invalidate a statute which had its own proper secular purpose, and which was not otherwise an entanglement or did not have the primary effect of advancing religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.740" offset="7478314">The--actually under this new statute, by far the lion's share of the money is going to the keeping of attendance records; 86.5 percent last year, which seems to be typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.331" offset="7528678">And this is largely going for the salaries--an allocated portion of the gross salary of the personnel in the school that take attendance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.867" offset="7558875">The dissent has--and also, my learned adversary--has belittled the state's interest in attendance-keeping, stating that after all, taking pupil attendance is also essential to the school's sectarian function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.443" offset="7613106">But this is not a function of the state which is to be belittled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.087" offset="7627734">Truancy is very much of a court matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.134" offset="7635884">The attendance records are presumptive evidence in court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.638" offset="7649886">They're of great concern to parents who are pulled before the court in child neglect proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.214" offset="7668276">The truancy officers are employed by the public school district, and they haul into court the children in the non-public schools the same as if they were in the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.602" offset="7701817">It makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.949" offset="7707146">And the state board of education itself scrutinizes with great interest the date that comes from all of the schools, public or non-public, for trends as to dropouts, illegal absences, transfers, and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.922" offset="7855104">Is there any claim that that's part of the entanglement here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="shirley_adelson_siegel" startTime="1941.889" stopTime="2384.259">
            <label>Ms. Shirley Adelson Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="1941.889" offset="7870882">That has not been claimed in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.395" offset="7888959">I don't know whether my adversary would claim that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.341" offset="7904737">But nothing's been said about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.183" offset="7908080">Now, of course, the fact that there's an incidental benefit to the private school in that it would like to have pupil attendance records anyway is an incidental benefit which certainly should not detract from the secular purpose of attendance-keeping which is such a fundamental child welfare service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.037" offset="7987493">The incidental benefits in the Sunday closing laws and in the busing case, and ever since--and in other decisions of this Court have been held to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.724" offset="8038275">I mean, it may be an incentive to parents to send their children to parochial schools, or it may certainly confer some benefit on the school, but it is not in and of itself a reason for invalidating a statute, just because they might have some incidental benefit from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.323" offset="8100655">The attendance records are so much like child welfare records that one tends really to think it's reasonable to include them in the same category as busing or school lunches or providing lights for athletic fields, services which are so totally secular and non-ideological in character, and here, very much part of a welfare system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.040" offset="8207548">And we recall that in the Everson case, when busing was upheld, the analogy there was made to the service of having a policeman available to the schools, and streets and sidewalks and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.959" offset="8267212">And keeping attendance and providing the welfare services that go with it is really in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.606" offset="8285811">Now in the Wolman case--and I do not think that the question before the Court today turns on whether in Wolman it has retreated from Meek.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.172" offset="8328025">To us, it's all quite consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.505" offset="8337429">And we find that the case that we're presenting to you falls neatly within the parameters that have been set within these rather definite adjudications, which have been very helpful guidelines to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.559" offset="8397615">In Wolman, the matter of secular, non-ideological tests was squarely before the Court, paid for by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.849" offset="8442755">And it was held that this was perfectly acceptable; there was no primary effect to advance religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.112" offset="8475773">The school had had no control over the tests, just as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.312" offset="8492596">The logical basis for making any distinction between contributions in kind and in cash to the school would seem to falter if you have, as here, a situation where it is possible to trace the dollars with such precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.831" offset="8566680">It is indeed so ministerial and such nonjudgmental kind of audit that has to be made, once--in fact, an exhibit in this record shows a typical teacher's time record showing one-quarter hour for taking attendance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.975" offset="8647241">There are normal ranges that are well known to the state education department as to how long it should take to take attendance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.124" offset="8667826">If someone exceeds that range, they may then look to see whether this is a particularly large school; there may be other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.550" offset="8697605">Or they may pick up a phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.138" offset="8703875">The answer to the interrogatories by one of the intervenor-defendants indicates that there had been a phone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.317" offset="8720593">And in fact, I noted with interest that as to that intervenor-defendant, the amount of money they had received was substantially less than they had requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.004" offset="8747342">And I think it was because they probably had included the time of their own attendance officer, which is not something for which the state reimburses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.713" offset="8778271">The state reimburses only for the attendance keeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.621" offset="8789870">Now, the state reimbursement here is for a very special service, aside from this over 86 percent of this money which goes for the attendance keeping, child welfare service, there is an annual statistics report on pupil enrollment, facilities that are available, the number of handicapped children, and so on, and that is the same information that comes in from public schools throughout the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.011" offset="8903450">It is immediately computerized and made available and used for so many various purposes that it's really--it's hard to identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.464" offset="8953187">But it is the basic profile of the schools throughout the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.164" offset="8971995">The balance of the money goes for administering--administering is a very good word, because they're really administrative tasks almost entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.579" offset="9009716">The state-prepared and state-required tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.325" offset="9020688">And these can very briefly be described to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.673" offset="9034062">First, there are the reading and math tests which are totally objective, and which are given to all third grade and sixth grade students throughout the state, whether they're in public or non-public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.356" offset="9080769">This--it happens that these tests developed out of the Federal Act Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and the results of the test, which are given to the state, target the schools where there are low-achieving pupils, who will then be made available--made eligible for the resources under the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.828" offset="9186722">They are scored by the teachers, and the rating guides are given so that the teachers don't even have to make any independent judgment as to whether two and two is four, because the answers are all set down for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.720" offset="9242206">The next group of tests for which reimbursement is provided are basic competency tests, which are now being required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.798" offset="9270523">In June of this year for the first time, all high school graduates throughout the state, in order to get their diplomas, have to pass a math and reading test, and that is something that is required of these schools as well, and--the giving of such a tests, which is marked--has no essay questions at all, marked at the schools, is reimbursed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.868" offset="9370833">And finally, in the more--in the example to which I believe Mr. Pfeffer referred, are the Regents Examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.576" offset="9401657">These, again, are prepared by the state, and they are marked initially by the teachers of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.383" offset="9432900">These are examinations which are given for college-bound students; not all secondary school students take these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.847" offset="9466755">The satisfactory completion of the state-designed courses of study which lead to the Regents Examination, and together with the taking of those courses and so on, may make a student eligible for a Regents diploma, which is a special diploma, considered meaningful by our state university, for example, for admission purposes; and a historic tradition that goes way back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.170" offset="9576051">Now, it's since 1865 that these Regents Examinations have been given statewide to secondary school students who were eligible, and without any distinction between public and nonpublic schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.843" offset="9630699">Since 1904--</text>

            <label>Ms. Shirley Adelson Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="2390.743" offset="9666330">The amount of money, according to the answers of the defendant-intervenors here, it would seem that perhaps 8-9 percent of the money that they've been receiving from the state under this Act is for their activity in connection with the Regents Examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.136" offset="9747937">The--preparing for the examinations, they are given in 20 different subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.080" offset="9763715">They are all wholly non--wholly objective, except that there are some essay questions in English and in Social Studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.680" offset="9802062">The questions are graded below, as I say, since 1904, and reviewed in Albany.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.986" offset="9835290">They now review just a 5 percent sample of all of the questions, but whether they come from a nonpublic school or a public school makes no difference; the same professional unit reviews these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.046" offset="9871548">And for the essay questions, elaborate rating guides are provided, giving many sample answers, and indicating how they should be handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.155" offset="9908015">And in fact, the head of the unit that does this says they really have no idea when they're responding to the questions, when they're marking them, reviewing them, whether the questions have been prepared by a nonpublic or public school student.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.380" offset="9960887">They have not detected any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.699" offset="9970186">In any event, this certainly would not be a primary effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.036" offset="9987532">Now, the question that's been raised here about diverting some of the money to religious uses, because perhaps there would be inaccurate records has been answered in part by my saying that it's well known in the state education department just how much time should be spent on taking attendance, and they can multiply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.238" offset="10076348">In the case of the tests, they have computer printouts which indicate just at what schools which tests have been given, to which they advert in making their audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.981" offset="10119293">And they also have parameters by which they're guided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.903" offset="10130996">For example, in the case of the Regents Examinations, which are a three-hour exam, they have been allowing about four hours for the preparing and even the grading of the Regents Exam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.212" offset="10188257">If these parameters seem to you rather tight, I might mention that the state comptroller's office had had a hand in approving them; and in fact, every application which has been audited and approved for payment by the state education department also must go to the state comptroller's office for a pre-audit before the payment is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.312" offset="10284596">The conclusion of our argument is that there certainly is no breach here in the neutrality that the state is to maintain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.653" offset="10346036">It has historically required the taking of attendance of giving of Regents Examinations, and certain other standardized tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.173" offset="10388041">And it obviously is in need of the essential census data that it receives every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.125" offset="10411865">All of this is very readily auditable, and we believe that we have carefully framed a statute in response to the injunctions of this Court in the directions that it gave involving the Mandated Services Act, which is known as Levitt I, and consequently the decision below is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2671.064" offset="10787610">And also, in Meek, there were auxilliary services, which involved putting remedial teachers, who were public employees, right into the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.903" offset="10827003">And it was felt that because of the pervasive religious environment of those schools that it would require a great deal of surveillance to make sure that they weren't infected by the environment.</text>
