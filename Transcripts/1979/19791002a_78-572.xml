            <text syncTime="35.658" offset="246053">This case is being argued in tandem with Deposit Guaranty National Bank against Roper, in which the Court just heard argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.974" offset="275310">In this case, as with the petitioners in Roper, we contend that the case became moot upon the expiration of the named plaintiff's claim after the District Court denied the request for class certification, but the facts of this case differ from those of Roper.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.650" offset="341974">Respondent Geraghty initiated this action in 1976, while he was serving a two and one half-year criminal sentence in federal prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.579" offset="377710">He contended that the parole guidelines that are used by the United States Parole Commission in determining whether and when the release of prisoner on parole are invalid under the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act and under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.175" offset="436120">He moved to have the case certified as a class action on behalf of all federal prisoners who have been or will become eligible for parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.746" offset="474363">The District Court denied the request for class certification, noting that the proposed class was too broad because not all federal prisoners share respondent's claims in common.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.380" offset="572897">He sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the Commission under 28 U.S.C. 1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.726" offset="610304">The Court then rejected respondent's legal claims on the merits and granted summary judgement to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.609" offset="641860">Respondent appealed, but while his appeal was pending, he was released from federal prison at the expiration of his criminal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.139" offset="671953">The Court of Appeals ruled that although respondent's legal claims became moot upon his release from prison, the case was not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.451" offset="709151">The court reasoned that if the proposed class was certifiable and the court thought that it was because of a possible use of subclasses, then the case can be remanded to the District Court for class certification and then proceed on behalf of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.734" offset="766307">And the court also reversed the award of summary judgement for the Commission ruling that under respondent's alligations, the guidelines may conflict with statutory parole criteria and create an ex post facto enhancement of punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.102" offset="915832">Now, we sought certiorari on four questions and I'll discuss two of those at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.298" offset="936521">First, whether the case became moot upon respondent's release from prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.735" offset="954284">Second, whether the Parole Commission and guidelines are invalid under the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act, and we rely on our briefs on the remaining issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.923" offset="999111">This Court has ruled on several occasions that there is no constitutional case or controversy, unless there exists at each stage of the litigation, an actual dispute between adverse parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.288" offset="1052505">And because of that, in Jacobs, Pasadena and Kremens, the Court has held that a case becomes moot if at the time the claim of the named litigant becomes moot, there is no properly certified class that can succeed as a party to the adversary position in the litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.183" offset="7956146">The -- just to -- to backtrack a little bit, our basic claim in the case is that the guideline system is unlawful, that it's contrary to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.644" offset="8009958">The Court of Appeals reviewed the case from the grant to summary judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1994.732" offset="8082265">The first is what way that's given to institutional behavior in parole release decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.012" offset="8099401">We allege that that is not a factor in parole release decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.081" offset="8115702">The Court of Appeals -- the Government disputed that in their answer and the Court of Appeals concluded that that question can only be disposed off on a full record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.493" offset="8153318">We expect to show in the District Court that as the Parole Commission's information reveals and perhaps 3% of all cases is a decision made to depart from its guidelines because of institutional behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.462" offset="8205249">What the Parole Commission Guidelines consist of is a chart which contains customary lines from prisoners for various categories of offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.673" offset="8242030">The categories are unrelated to the sentence which was imposed or to the sentence which could have been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.940" offset="8267107">It's possible to be sentenced for an offense which is punishable by not more than five years in prison, but come up on the Parole Commission with an offense which should've -- which requires you to serve 70 to 85 months in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.031" offset="8327502">The -- the table of the -- of the guidelines is this matrix, which consists of offense severity levels and salient factor scores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.641" offset="8361984">The -- our allegations and we expect to show in the District Court, the way in which a parole release decision is made, is that within four months after someone's in prison, they got a parole hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.665" offset="8406079">At that parole hearing, two hearing examiners sit down and look at these guidelines to re-rate the severity of a prisoner's offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.998" offset="8443382">They don't look at the sentence which was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.092" offset="8451741">They don't look at the sentence which could've been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.766" offset="8462399">They look at how this prisoner matches up on their score.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.268" offset="8476400">The Court of Appeals held that we were entitled to summary judgment on that allegation that we would have to prove it and I think we can prove that easily, if we can get these individual decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.336" offset="8512763">But on this record, I think the Court has to view the record, the same way the Court of Appeals did in light of most favorable to us, as if we had proved this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.297" offset="8544528">Once the Parole Commission has re-rated the severity of the prisoner's offense, they compute his salient factor score.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.202" offset="8576188">The salient factor score goes from 0 to 11 and awards points for various things that may or may not have been statistically significant in post-release behavior of some prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.821" offset="8622686">The -- once those two scales are computed, the hearing examiners look at the chart and see what the customary length of imprisonment could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.780" offset="8658526">Then there's a judgment made as to whether a decision should be made to depart from those guidelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="2337.596" offset="9453798">Now from this, the Commission says that, "Well, Congress is authorizing us to do what we've been doing before, which was to use those kinds of guidelines."</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.857" offset="9482846">That's not at all clear and that's exactly contrary to what's in the Conference Report which talks about how in promulgating its guidelines, the Commission shall be cognizant to past criticisms of its decision-making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.873" offset="9530911">Some of those criticisms which are in the House hearings was that the guidelines which the Board is using are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.095" offset="9559751">You serve the sentencing function and are just improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.793" offset="9574588">The Board should not be in the sentencing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.968" offset="9587231">The -- something else, the 1976 Act did was to make permanent some changes that the Board have adopted in administrative reorganization in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.518" offset="9629445">The Commission seeks to argue that by making those improvements permanent, what Congress is doing, was saying, the guidelines should be permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.639" offset="9661942">But if we go back and look at the Senate hearings, we see that the controversy about those improvements was about the delegation of authority to hearing examiners, that there were some questions that whether that could lawfully be done with that new legislation and that's what Congress was looking at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.297" offset="9724531">There's absolutely no indication that Congress intended that parole release decision to be a resentencing decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.191" offset="9752116">That Congress intended parole to be made without consideration of what the prisoner did in prison, which is what the Court would have to read the statute is being, in order to hold that these guidelines are consistent with the 1976 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.014" offset="9811466">This -- the Act rather than saying that all these factors could not be considered, the Act reaffirmed the view that parole is dependent upon what people do in prison and that's -- we allege and expect to prove in the District Court is not a factor in these guidelines or what these guidelines are as a resentencing tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.585" offset="9893700">One question which I think has been answered without dispute in the District Court is where do these guidelines come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.675" offset="9926092">How did the Parole Commission get in the business of making parole release decisions without considering the actual length of sentence?</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.202" offset="9952214">And we've documented that fairly well without any dispute, that what happened was that the Parole Commission did a study of how decisions were made in youth correctional cases, where there was no sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.265" offset="10004459">And this study show that two factors or three factors were used in parole release decisions and the people who did the study decided or mistakenly believed that all release decisions were made the same way as youth correctional cases and created guidelines for the Board which applied those two or three factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.053" offset="10079587">The fact is that 75% of all adult prisoners have to serve a third of their sentence before they become eligible for parole and it's under -- it's wrong to say that the Parole Commission was making -- was -- was using the same policy in youth act cases that it was using in adult cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.351" offset="10144789">But that -- that's why the length of sentence is no longer a factor in the parole release decisions, because the Parole Board entrusted to its researchers the task of developing guidelines which probably weren't understood by the Board which were caved to it as having been scientifically developed and which should've been used to interfere with the interest that the members of this potential class having parole release.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.047" offset="10271535">The -- some of the other claims which were presented in the complaint, which were not brought up I believe, in the narrow question posed in the petition for writ of certiorari, include -- if these guidelines are consistent with the statute, could Congress have lawfully delegated this power to the Parole Commission?</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.683" offset="10354082">Could Congress without any standards at all say, you are to set -- you, the Parole Commissioner, set new standards for how long people should do in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.774" offset="10390444">Could Congress delegate this judicial function of resentencing to an administrative agency?</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.938" offset="10415104">And then there's another question which is based on our allegation that under the new policies, under the guidelines, people serve more time in prison than they serve formally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.627" offset="10461915">That with the heightened emphasis on offense severity, someone who would've been released after he or she had served the third of their sentence, is now required to serve their entire sentence in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.909" offset="10507055">If this is true, and we expect the evidence to show that, then there's an ex post facto question, which the Government seems to disagree with but based merely upon the facts rather than upon the applicability of the Ex Post Facto Clause to parole release petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.992" offset="10567346">Those questions I think weren't brought up in the narrow -- in question 3 in the petition for certiorari, so even if the Court should agree with the Parole Commission on the issue it brought up, there should still be further proceedings in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.495" offset="10621367">And if the District Court concludes that Geraghty cannot adequately represent the class because he's no longer in prison, as we told the District Court in August of 1978, that's not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.707" offset="10674239">There are other people who have communicated with the attorneys of Mr. Geraghty who said, "We want to be in your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.359" offset="10704854">We want to be named plaintiffs because we think the system is wrong and it should be changed."</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.932" offset="10931075">Mr. Jones, do you have anything further?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="2709.314" offset="10940583">I -- I wanted to point out again that the respondents' arguments basically, go to the wisdom and reasonableness of the Parole Guidelines system and Senator Burdick and the members of the Conference Committee simply disagree on whether this is a wise system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.446" offset="11009128">As we note on page 65 of our brief, Senator Burdick explained that these were the guidelines that he wanted to have promulgate -- promulgated under this legislation and the Conference Committee Reports and now I'll quote it, "The promulgation of guidelines to make parole less disparate and more understandable, has met with such success that this legislation incorporates the system into the statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.689" offset="11110170">The last point I wanted to make was that respondent in the Court of Appeals both said that, perhaps, the -- the final legislation didn't ratify the guidelines because Representative Kastenmeier said on the floor of the House that the final legislation was a compromise, but to compromise is evidence simply by comparing 4206 (a) to 4206 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.298" offset="11204524">The House had proposed a presumptive parole provision under which prisoners would be released after one third of their sentence, unless there were good reasons not to release him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.484" offset="11245275">The Senate on the other hand, wanted the guideline provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.487" offset="11257292">The Senate got its way in 4206 (a) and the House got most of what it wanted in 4206 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.964" offset="11283205">There is a presumptive release provision but it applies after a prisoner serves two thirds of his term and that was the compromise.</text>
