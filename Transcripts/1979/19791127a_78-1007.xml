            <text syncTime="14.069" offset="160664">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.575" offset="178740">This is a case of first impression and, indeed, of national importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.755" offset="203400">We are called upon today for the first time to deal with the question of the constitutionality of a mandatory racial quota imposed by Congress in a public works funding Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.596" offset="286783">This is not a case dealing with employment discrimination or discrimination on the part of unions in the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.675" offset="331086">The question is whether or not Congress can enact an outright racial quota and, if so, under what circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.490" offset="374345">The Act we are concerned with is the Local Public Works Employment Act where under (2) $4 billion was appropriated for local public works funding throughout the country in order to assist what was at the time a flagging construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.825" offset="487717">Just prior to the passage of this appropriations bill Representative Mitchell proposed an amendment to the bill which provided in substance that any grantee receiving funds other than the Act must assure the Secretary that at least 10 percent of those monies would be set aside and appropriated solely for the use of minority business enterprises as defined in the Act.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="129.626" offset="622926">Mr. Benisch, does it make any difference in your argument whether Congress was acting under its authority to tax and spend or whether it was acting under its authority to enforce the 14th Amendment?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert G. Benisch</label>
            <text syncTime="144.814" offset="683635">I think, Your Honor, in looking at the legislative history and record here it makes a great deal of difference to observe what Congress was about when it passed the Local Public Works Employment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.531" offset="754479">In other words, it was not dealing in the area of civil rights legislation such as it might have been doing when it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="172.166" stopTime="179.899">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="172.166" offset="793036">Did Congress in this particular Act make any findings as to discrimination in the employment area?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_g_benisch" startTime="179.899" stopTime="323.857">
            <label>Mr. Robert G. Benisch</label>
            <text syncTime="179.899" offset="823965">I submit, Your Honor, none whatsoever, and that is the first prong to my argument, that indeed an examination of the legislative record and history discloses that there was absolutely no finding made whatsoever in the record or even in the discussions, of found discrimination on the part of the non-minority business community in the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.501" offset="946427">Now, it is -- I think it is critical to note at the outset here that in its recent decision this Court in Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney held that a racial classification regardless of purported motivation is presumptively invalid and can be upheld only upon a showing of extraordinary justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.964" offset="1068262">I submit that with that presumption of invalidity in mind it is therefore incumbent on the Government in this action to rebut that presumption because we are dealing purely and simply with a racial classification required across the board and mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.456" offset="1150182">Now, we submit here that neither the Government nor the courts below have cited any authority which rebuts the presumption and validity of that racial classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.994" offset="1204412">For purposes of my argument here today, petitioners will concede that if the racial classification or the amendment to the Act were to pass what has become known as the strict scrutiny test, it might be held that the presumption is rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.239" offset="1309320">Now, the strict scrutiny test has two prongs, as we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.322" offset="1321650">The first is there must be a compelling governmental interest behind the passage of the Act or the legislation in question; and, secondly, the means used or the mechanism must be the least intrusive or onerous available.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.646" offset="1395001">Now, as to the compelling Government --</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="323.857" stopTime="332.055">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="323.857" offset="1399808">Why can't Congress just spend the money it raises by taxation in the manner it deems best?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_g_benisch" startTime="332.055" stopTime="362.323">
            <label>Mr. Robert G. Benisch</label>
            <text syncTime="332.055" offset="1432618">Your Honor, the spending power, the cases have held that Congress cannot spend the taxpayers' money which is collected on a nondiscriminatory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.970" offset="1480265">Congress can't spend it in a discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.047" offset="1492595">But without getting cute about it, if you will, I am simply saying that whatever Congress does with respect to monies or any passage, it must do in a constitutional manner.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="362.323" offset="1553721">No one doubts that.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.043" offset="1560618">But do you think that Congress is under the same strictures when it simply grants money as it is when it regulates private industry in a constitutional sense?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert G. Benisch</label>
            <text syncTime="378.327" offset="1617669">I most certainly do.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.549" offset="1622580">In other words, I don't think that the subject matter of the legislation affects in any way the constitutionality of the Act being passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.538" offset="1694574">In other words, whether Congress is acting under its spending powers, whether it is acting under its civil rights powers, or whatever, whatever it does must be done in -- pursuant to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.653" offset="1747028">That is, it cannot violate the Fifth Amendment and it cannot -- it must act in accordance with the strictures and prescriptions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.123" offset="1788928">We submit that in this case Congress -- there is no indication that Congress has acted in accordance with the Constitution; and, in fact, we believe that it has violated Article 5 of that Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.131" offset="2012954">And I believe that what we are faced with here is their having been endrafted on a funding bill, an 11th hour after thought; and when we look at the legislative record we have the sponsor's statement as follows we spend a great deal of Federal money under the SBA program creating, strengthening and supporting minority businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.125" offset="2156941">Yet, when it comes down to giving those minority businesses a piece of the action the Federal Government is sorely remiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.106" offset="2196856">Now, the purpose of the amendment as proposed by Mr. Mitchell was to give the minority business community a share of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.986" offset="2252340">Now, Congress sat down, it was appropriating $400 million, and it said, $400 million for minority business enterprises is not going to hurt anybody and we ought to give them a piece of the action.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.412" offset="3165999">And I am referring specifically to the following language of Justice Powell's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.678" offset="3187106">We have never approved a classification that aids persons perceived as members of relatively victimized groups at the expense of other innocent individuals in the absence of judicial, legislative or administrative findings of constitutional or statutory violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.677" offset="3267145">After such findings have been made, the governmental interest in preferring members of the injured group at the expense of others is substantial, since the legal rights of the victims must be vindicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.453" offset="3310195">In such a case the extent of the injury and the consequent remedy will have been judicially, legislatively or administratively defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.713" offset="3343214">Also, the remedial action usually remains subject to continuing oversight to insure that it will work the least possible harm to other innocent persons competing for the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.796" offset="3387622">Without such findings of constitutional or statutory violations, it cannot be said that the Government has any greater interest in helping one individual than in refraining from harming another.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.286" offset="5685561">As my co-petitioner counsel mentioned at the start of his argument, this case is of historical importance, it is of practical importance, and it does not come to this Court without antecedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.222" offset="5753271">Only 25 years ago this Court in the Dunn decision, Brown v. Board of Education, condemning a theory of separate but equal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.442" offset="5834146">What are quotas?</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.559" offset="5842610">Essentially it is a form of sufferatism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.251" offset="5853372">You are carving out a people, a group, and saying that they need special treatment, or should receive special treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.479" offset="5922335">I agree, Your Honor, that that has been done to remedy certain problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.987" offset="5944383">But we start with the theory -- and I think that is where we all must start -- the theory is that separatism based on race is bad, unless there is a compelling reason for some remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.529" offset="6002479">You have to focus on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.691" offset="6011152">We go back beyond Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.467" offset="6018257">We go back 65 years to a case Truax v. Raich, in fact in some way someone could say is identical to this situation, although from a lawyer's view-point you could easily distinguish any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.676" offset="6063083">But Truax is an interesting case because 65 years ago a statute was passed, a statute which for employers in a particular State a requirement was imposed upon them that if they had five or more employees, 80 percent of their employees had to be native Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.759" offset="6151481">Twenty percent could be anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.096" offset="6164752">A resident alien suit, this Court struck it down on the grounds that it denied that individual a fundamental right to engage in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.994" offset="6224415">Now, what we have done here is reverse the quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.167" offset="6237059">Instead of having 80 percent for native Americans we have turned it around and given 10 percent for blacks, the Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Alaskans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.425" offset="6290139">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.874" offset="6295886">Why this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.961" offset="6304246">Well, looking at the 10 percent, you talk about a statute that is infringing upon the rights of a particular class, of giving rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.880" offset="6351893">It is interesting to note a few things about the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.667" offset="6363073">It talks of 10 percent nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.937" offset="6376135">Why 10 percent?</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.487" offset="6382299">Why not 4 percent, which is the number of black contractors in the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.689" offset="6399122">Why not 17 or 25 percent in New York, or 2 percent in Arizona?</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.242" offset="6429320">Why are women and other minorities excluded?</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.544" offset="6442590">Why are Orientals included?</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.647" offset="6450949">The Government in this case two years ago in Bakke came to this Court and said there is no discrimination against Orientals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.401" offset="6478012">In the very brief they filed in this case, the appendix gives all the statistics regarding Whites, Hispanics, and doesn't show any discrimination against Orientals, the picking and choosing and no explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.877" offset="6523883">But go further, they use terms like "Spanish speaking."</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.763" offset="6543423">They are not saying Hispanics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.322" offset="6549692">They are saying Spanish speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.801" offset="6555648">Even the Government in other contexts have dropped that word because, even though I didn't do very well in school in languages, I could be Spanish speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.145" offset="6592951">And the Government dropped it in other contexts because of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.047" offset="6604549">It was used for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.219" offset="6613222">Even if you took a term like "Hispanic," there is no explanation as to who is Hispanic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.350" offset="6633806">The Government in other contexts have said Portugese from Portugal are not Hispanics, but Portugese from Brazil up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.990" offset="6676334">We have all of these questions, but no answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.064" offset="6688664">I am not saying there can't be answers, but when you get down to a question like Indians, this Court in previous terms has considered who is and who is not an Indian, different kinds of Indians, tribal Indians, Indians living off and on reservations at different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.000" offset="6760448">Despite the stereotype you see on television, if you see an Indian walking down the street in Washington without any tribal head dress, you could not segregate him out from the populous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.214" offset="6841219">There is also a little interesting thing that there is a set-aside of 2-1/2 percent for work done on tribal lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3620.644" offset="14586943">Insofar as the Petitioners have argued that the minority business enterprise provision violates title VI, I think what we have here is legislation that in the same document dealt with discrimination based upon sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.703" offset="14659250">In other words, Congress was thinking in title VI terms at the same time that it enacted the minority business enterprise provision.</text>
