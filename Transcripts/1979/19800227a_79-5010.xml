            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear argument first this morning in Bifulco against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.574" offset="133622">Mr. Barrett you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_lloyd_barrett" startTime="12.987" stopTime="166.298">
            <label>Mr. Steven Lloyd Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="12.987" offset="155355">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.445" offset="169148">This case comes to the Court upon writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.665" offset="197987">The petitioner was convicted of violating the Federal Drug Conspiracy Law 21 U.S.C., Section 846.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.101" offset="227767">He was sentenced to four years imprisonment, and $1,000 fine, and five years special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.967" offset="255248">The petitioner subsequently filed per se a collateral attack on his sentence alleging that the inclusion of special parole for the crime of conspiracy was not authorized and Second Circuit held that special parole was a lawful component of sentence of conspiracy and affirmed the denial of petitioner's application.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.819" offset="338631">The issue in this case which is currently the subject of disagreement among the circuits is whether as the Second Circuit held Section 846 includes special parole or whether as we assert the statute specification of imprisonment and fine precludes special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.827" offset="414699">The statutory language of Section 846 is set forth in our brief, at page 3, and it's states, “Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this Subchapter is punishable by imprisonment, or fine, or both which may not exceed the maximum of punishment prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="101.857" offset="510830">We submit that the penalties intended to conspiracy are stated plainly on the face of the statute, imprisonment and fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.404" offset="548968">In our argument this morning, it will be shown that Congress used the precise specification of penalties for the very purpose of providing imprisonment without special parole for the crime of conspiracy and I'll be looking at four issues bearing on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.571" offset="613648">First, I will examine the statutory scheme and Section 846's place in that scheme, to show that throughout the statute, special parole maybe imposed only when it is separately authorized from imprisonment and fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.829" offset="670699">Second, I will look at the legislative history to elucidate Congress's intent that a specification of imprisonment of fine in a statutory section cannot alone authorize the inclusion of special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.120" offset="727855">Third, I will discuss the Government's analysis of Congress's intent and show that that position cannot be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.763" offset="750425">And finally, I will consider the appropriate disposition of this case under the doctrine of lenity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="166.298" stopTime="180.988">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="166.298" offset="768606">Mr. Barrett I think it's -- in your legislative history discussion you will also take up the time sequence at which the statute was drafted and the time at which special parole was introduced as a concept under the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_lloyd_barrett" startTime="180.988" stopTime="578.168">
            <label>Mr. Steven Lloyd Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="180.988" offset="827329">Yes I will Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.039" offset="839555">Turning first to the statutory scheme, special parole exists as a punishment quite distinct from the punishment of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.815" offset="874663">It's provided as an additional and separate penalty to be served after full service of a prison term.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.723" offset="902248">Now, special parole is subject to no maximum limit so that it can and often does exceed the prison term in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.315" offset="936626">This is important because of the -- revocation -- revocation rule which is then upon revocation special parole a new and additional prison term is substituted in the amount of the entire special parole term without credit for time served.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.141" offset="995976">Now, it's therefore a substantial penalty and Congress authorized its inclusion selectively by a separate provision in each statutory paragraph to finding a crime to which special parole would be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.968" offset="1051251">Now, quite a number and indeed the majority of the drug crimes provide for imprisonment without specification or without mention of any special parole and significantly the crime of the continuing criminal enterprise which is the most serious trafficking offense in the Federal Drug Law does not specify a special parole term.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.950" offset="1127215">And similarly there is no specification of special parole in the offenses involving trafficking by persons who are registered under the drug law.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.757" offset="1158353">Generally the parole -- special parole authorizations occur in the distribution and possession offenses to find in Section 841, but even here there is selectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.795" offset="1202552">Two of the six -- two of the six punishment sections in Section 841 do not provide for special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.258" offset="1240377">Now, in practice, there is never been any question that a drug section which does not make any mention of special parole is not entitled to include as sentenced special parole with one exception, and that of course the Section 846 which is the issue that's presently before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.857" offset="1310804">From the standpoint to the statutory scheme, we -- we feel at this unique treatment quoted in Section 846 which some -- which some circuits at least have given Section 846 makes no sense like the other sections throughout the drug law which do not make -- mention of special parole and which special parole does not apply, Section 846 describes it's punishments in terms of imprisonment and fine exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.620" offset="1405889">Unlike these other section, Section 846 is a separate criminal section under which sentences are imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.765" offset="1430444">The purported distinction for it's -- Section 846 which the Government offers to justify the inclusion of Section -- of special parole in Section 846 notwithstanding the absence of special parole authorization is that the conspiracy section refers to the statutory section of the object offense to set the limits of punishment applicable to the particular conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.547" offset="1521560">And the Government contends that this reference results in the incorporation into Section 846 of any special parole that would be required in the object defense section where sentence is imposed under that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.974" offset="1571297">We feel this argument by the Government misperceives the significance and the function of Section 846 specification of imprisonment and fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.096" offset="1611734">Section 846 refers to the object offense sections to set the amount, but not the type of the punishment authorized, Section 846 itself sets the type of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.028" offset="1655515">The accuracy of this reading is supported by the House Report which accompanied the bill which is ultimately enacted by the Congress and -- and in that report, in a description of the operation of the conspiracy section and the -- and the penalty for conspiracy, the House Committee I believe it's the Interstate and Foreign Commerce, stated -- described the punishment as imprisonment and/or fine which may not exceed the maximum amount set for the object offense and -- and as this statement indicates the imprisonment and fine close of Section 846 defines the type of punishment which is to be imposed for that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.959" offset="1815176">A proof that Section 846 is -- referencing structure which is again the basis of the Government's distinction, a proof that it is referencing structure does not justify any special treatment is clear from another section of the drug law.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.492" offset="1865331">Now, that's the section that's numerically proceeds Section 846 -- Section 845.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.679" offset="1882049">It's set forth in Footnote 25 of our brief at page 20 and that's the distribution to minor section.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.238" offset="1908276">Now, Section 845 like Section 846, uses reference to another sections sentencing limits but there's a very significant distinction of the face of the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.940" offset="1955088">Whereas Section 846 as I've indicated specifies, in one clause, imprisonment or fine or both, Section 845 has two clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.554" offset="1985599">The first clause specifies a reference for imprisonment and fine, and that in that sense reassembles Section 846, but there is a separate second clause which provides for the incorporation of special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.608" offset="2041814">I have more to say that Section 845 in my legislative history discussion but for the present it bears noting that Section 845 shows that the characteristic that I've identified in the drug law, and that is -- that before special parole is included in the section, there must be a specific -- special parole authorization in the individual section.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.332" offset="2128750">That Section 845 shows that that -- that characteristic or that rule applies to sections which used referencing and that therefore Section 846 should not be treated unusually, it should be treated like all the other sections throughout the drug law which do not makes specific reference to special parole, it should be in other words no special parole should be authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.416" offset="2213073">And looking out the legislative history, the legislative history confirms that's the specification of imprisonment and fine in Section 846 was intended to define a punishment which would not include special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.740" offset="2266363">In particular, two points are established in legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.374" offset="2280887">First, as the sections which like this conspiracy section used referencing to another section to establish the amount of penalty available, Congress recognized the need for a separate special parole authorization in a section employing the reference if that section was to include special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.163" offset="2356015">And the second thing that the legislative history demonstrates is that Congress added special parole clauses to other sections which employed this referencing, but it did not so add a special parole clause to Section 846.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="578.168" offset="2415992">Well, is it fair to infer from your argument that before Congress introduced the concept to the special parole into this rewriting of the drug law, 846 clearly manifested the intent that one who was -- attempted or conspired to violate the law should be punished in the same manner as the one who committed the substantive offense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_lloyd_barrett" startTime="606.359" stopTime="715.998">
            <label>Mr. Steven Lloyd Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="606.359" offset="2528841">I don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.397" offset="2532916">I -- I think that that is happenstance of the way the -- the initial bills were drafted, but I think that there are -- are two important reasons why we should not find that the original formulation of the bills before the inclusion of special parole indicates an intent to have -- if I could use the Government's word in this congruence between the two sections, the conspiracy section and the operative section.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.847" offset="2642735">The -- the first reason why has to do with the -- the structure of the new drug law.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.017" offset="2675440">In the former law, conspiracy was within the -- the specific substantive sections and in every bill considers for the new law, conspiracy was withdrawn from the substantive section and established in its own section.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.700" offset="2738134">Now, we feel that -- if you look trough other penal sections throughout the United States Code, you find that when conspiracy is separated from the substantive offense, generally the sentences provided are disparate rather than congruent.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.497" offset="2817337">And that you find congruence in a sense in -- in cases in which the conspiracy section is allowed to remain within the substantive offense section.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.567" offset="2849625">Now, I'm not suggesting that when Congress, the 91st Congress removed conspiracy from the substantive offense section.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.733" offset="2874284">In this case, it was intending to create this word -- sentences or necessitates the finding of these current sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.231" offset="2896332">What I'm saying, is that it was originally in a situation where congruence was necessitated and it was thereafter placed in a situation were traditionally congruence was not found and I think to that sort of refutes the thought that Congress was thinking specifically in terms of establishing congruence.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="715.998" offset="2967385">Well, it could have just dropped 846 and punished on the general conspiracy statute if it wanted to do that in the --</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven Lloyd Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="726.051" offset="3007613">The general conspiracy statute would have required a specific term of five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.570" offset="3025690">No, it's -- the general conspiracy section would not have allowed any flexibility or differentiation between of various conspiracy sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.626" offset="3049827">I don't think that that would have accomplished their purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.242" offset="3064351">I think that there's one of the -- there's one point I wanted to make in response to your question Mr. Justice Rehnquist and that is that as to this -- this question of whether the -- the initial bill intended to have the similar treatment and that is to use to the language in every bill which the 91st Congress considered in Section 846 or in -- in the predecessor to the Section 846 and in no bill that Congress specify that punishment for conspiracy was subject to punishment equal to that of the substantive section.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.425" offset="3197053">It always used the term which may not exceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.492" offset="3209383">Now to be sure, using a term which may not exceed allows for the possibility that the sentences will be the same, but Congress is free also to use their equal to and equal to connotes something quite different than which may not exceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.305" offset="3260583">And -- and my point again in this, is that I think that reflects that Congress was not thinking specifically of setting up this equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.265" offset="3292453">Equalization was not on there mind when they drew this section.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="800.887" offset="3306872">But of course you have to prove more than just the Congress didn't mandate equality.</text>

            <text syncTime="812.731" offset="3354311">Well, let me -- let me say this, the -- the suggestion that you've made is that in the initial bills the -- before special parole is added there happened to be this relationship say that -- that the same kind of term was specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.629" offset="3421915">The basis of -- of a conclusion from that fact that Congress intended just to be the case was specifically the language and a structure of these two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.884" offset="3466951">Why not if you use that same standard of an analysis, say that after special parole was added, and after the one section had special parole and another one didn't, since your -- your analysis is based on the construction of the statutes as they exist or after special parole existed taking the statute as on their face, there was not this congruence any longer.</text>

            <text syncTime="972.948" offset="3995146">Now, the -- the key reason, the reason why that's of such this significance is because of the way Congress dealt with Section 845.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.127" offset="4027852">Now, Section 845 in the -- in the initial bills -- Section 845 and 846 reassembled each other before special parole that is, in that both of them specified imprisonment and fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.527" offset="4065468">Both of them had referencing, and both of them specified that the reference applied to imprisonment and fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.385" offset="4112906">In that sense then, both of them were subject to a very similar consequence, and that is that, they did not specify special parole, but the sections to which of both of them could refer might specify special parole because special parole had been -- had been entered into the bills at the time when both Section 845, the distribution to minors and 846 the conspiracy section still did not have those sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.951" offset="4195140">Now what Congress did in H.R. 18583, was that it added a separate -- separate clause to the distribution to minor section whereas originally it specified only that Section 845 is punishable by a term of imprisonment or fine, or both up to the twice that authorizing this - the substantive offense section, now it had a separate section that said at least twice any special parole term authorized by the substantive section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.355" offset="4308825">And this indicates that Congress felt that the imprisonment and fine specification was not adequate to bring in special parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.756" offset="6362363">I was speaking about the legislative history and I think I've covered really most of the points that I wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.970" offset="6383261">The -- the main point I wanted speak of course was that that Section 845 made this change, and 846 did not make this change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.557" offset="6413563">And I think that that indicates Congress's intentions, and I think that in fact if you look at H.R. 18583 which is the bill that was enacted by Congress, the intent of Congress with respect to these two sections is very, very clear in that -- in that bill they amended the parole revo -- in a parole revocation section there is a reference prior to H.R. 18583.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.364" offset="6500812">There is a reference to special parole imposed under this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.254" offset="6516381">Now, in conjunction with changing 845, by adding the second -- special parole clause, Congress changed the term imposed under this act to special parole imposed under Section 841 or 845.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.790" offset="6566536">No mention of Section 846 there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.732" offset="6574268">So 845 is included and 846 is excluded in terms of -- of this particular reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.334" offset="6596733">Now, that's in Section 841 (c) which is at page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.931" offset="6615124">We show that in light of Congress's act -- activity as to other sections it cannot be maintained that Congress' failure to add special parole as anything but intentional and it was -- the very purpose of keeping special parole out of a Section 846 sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.979" offset="6679280">If I could try to paraphrase Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Youngstown Sheet and Tube versus Sawyer case, it's one thing to say that Congress intended special parole to apply to conspiracy despite not having so specified where Congress did not address itself to the need for separate special parole authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.310" offset="6752632">But it's quite impossible when Congress didn't specifically address itself to the need for specific and specials -- to specific special parole authorization to find in Section 846 the grant of special parole authorization which Congress consciously withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.485" offset="6821282">We feel therefore, that the legislative history teaches the same lesson that statutory scheme does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.188" offset="6840090">And that is that Congress retain in Section 845's precise specification of penalties, imprisonment and fine for the purpose of providing for imprisonment without a special parole term for the crime of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.157" offset="6888051">My time is almost up, I -- I'm -- I just did want to say -- speak very briefly on the doctrine of lenity, because we feel that -- we feel in this case that the statutory language and legislative materials lead to an inescapable conclusion as the Congress' intent, but should this Court remain unconvinced and fine some merit in the Government's position, we feel that there are nonetheless sound reasons for disclosing this case by excluding special parole from this convict's sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.128" offset="7003930">The absence of special parole in Section 846 and -- and Congress's addition of special parole to other sections which was structured like Section 846, provokes to the very least some doubt in our favor and the most that the Government can prove we feel is -- is that there is ambiguity in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.239" offset="7068296">That it -- it cannot -- it cannot erase the express terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.188" offset="7088149">Where Congress' unwavering retention trough all these bills of the expression of imprisonment and fine or both, and therefore in -- in accordance with this Courts long preference for the resolution of ambiguity in criminal statutes in favor of lenity and particular in term of -- in light of this Court's determinations that lenity applies in sentencing cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.913" offset="7535052">Like petitioner we began by focusing on the statute itself and in particular on the statute as whole and determine what can be -- what -- what guidance can be drawn from the structure of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.490" offset="7601298">Sections 841 through 845 of Title XXI define various drug related substantive offenses and fits penalties for committing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.342" offset="7640691">Section 846, the attempt and conspiracy section, makes unlawful an attempt or conspiracy to commit one of those substantive offenses and -- however, Section 846 does not itself define the conduct which if attempted or planned with constitute in offense nor does it create sound penalty or sentencing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.404" offset="7744972">Instead Section 846 looks to the substantive offenses and takes from them, borrows from them, draws from them the penalty schemes that are included in those substantive offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.506" offset="7793351">Thus, whether the one looks at Section 846 as active or passive as a referencing statute or as a conduit, the language doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.765" offset="7826474">The reality is that Section 846 derives its meaning, its very meaning and derives its penalty structure from the substantive offenses, and imposes the same penalties in the same combinations as would apply to a substantive offense that was the object of a particular conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.049" offset="7903587">The fact that Section 846 refers to punishments “not to exceed” the maximum punishments set in the substantive offenses does not detract from this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.903" offset="7951026">True, Congress could have in -- could have stated that conspiracy sentences must be equal to sentences imposed for substantive offenses, but as a practical matter the difference between equal to and not to exceed the maximum -- the -- the difference doesn't exist, those -- those phrases are as a practical matter is synonymous because the Drug Abuse Act does not create fixed sentences or determine sentences rather fixes maximums, maximum terms of imprisonment, maximum fines and in the case of special parole, minimum -- minimum term, so that the talk in terms of equality really is to talk strange language because there is no fixed sentence that must be imposed even for substantive offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.640" offset="8141928">In other words, if Section 846 says, upper limits that same statement can be said of the substantive offenses which create upper limits for the -- for the imprisonment and fine that can be imposed under them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.216" offset="8204204">Now, the legislative history of -- of the Drug Abuse Act, we believe underscores this -- this congruence between sentencing for conspiracy and sentencing for underlying object offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.757" offset="8258435">The -- as Mr. -- well, the predecessor statutes -- the statutes that preceded the Drug Abuse Act, all provided for (Inaudible) for congruence between sentences imposed for conspiracy and sentences imposed for substantive offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.895" offset="8322905">In 1969, the administration introduced a comprehensive bill which was designed to make many changes in existing law, to consolidate existing law, to change the penalty scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.293" offset="8364596">However, and indeed that bill in every one of its incarnations, they'd create a separate sections for conspiracy which should not in the case prior to 1970 or 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.849" offset="8410781">But at no point the Congress change the basic congruity between sentencing for conspiracy in substantive offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.882" offset="8442859">In fact in response to your question Mr. Justice Rehnquist, petitioners in their reply brief I believe at page 7 conceive that this initial draft, the initial bill that was introduced in Congress in 1969, created punishments for conspiracy that would “identical quoting from their brief to sentences that would be imposed for related substantive offenses”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.596" offset="8541706">Now, at no point during Congress's consideration of -- of that bill, was there any indication that Congress desired to alter that identity between -- the sentencing identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.985" offset="8587264">Indeed, the spokespersons for the administration who spoke to the bill both before the passive to special patrol -- special parole introduced and after indicated that the concept of co-terminus sentencing was to be retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.884" offset="8650898">Turning to Section 845, that's the distribution to minors provisional statute, it's quite correct as -- as to Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out I believe that Section 845 is a substantive provision and to that extent it is different and kind in Section 846.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.403" offset="8728952">It's also correct as Mr. Justice Stevens pointed out that Section 845 is not a simple referencing statute, it changes the nature what it is referenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.290" offset="8764583">It provides for at -- for up to twice imprisonment and fine and at least twice the special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.107" offset="8795826">And in for that reason, there is some sense that -- that there is greater need for specificity in drafting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.100" offset="8827800">But beyond that, the history of Section 845 is radically different from the history Section 846.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.207" offset="8856221">During the course of -- of -- of the passage of the -- the comprehensive bill on route to becoming the Drug Abuse Act, Congress rewrote virtually every word of Section 845.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.522" offset="8909511">Congress altered its language and indeed its -- its substance and during the course of that those alternations took the opportunity to effect to conformity changes to which petitioner refers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.198" offset="8952142">Specific with the first after Section 845, specified that the purchaser must be eight -- under the age of 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.337" offset="8992684">It specifies that there must be a three-year deferential between the ages of purchaser and seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.518" offset="9009403">In other words, the -- the seller must be at least three years older than the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.258" offset="9028420">That initial draft tried to differentiate between narcotics distribution and other kind -- distribution of other kinds of controlled substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.122" offset="9063842">Most importantly that that initial draft provided for an enhanced -- enhanced imprisonment that is twice the imprisonment but did not provide for an enhanced fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.584" offset="9109713">Now, the second draft of -- of section -- of what became Section 845 occurred after the concept of special parole was introduced, after a series of hearings were held in both houses of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.896" offset="9158928">That second draft however, did not plug in the concept of special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.302" offset="9176586">It -- it tinkered a little bit with -- with that distinction that I mentioned between narcotics and other kinds of drug distribution offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.491" offset="9205321">In the third and final draft of the -- of the statute, the narcotics are the controlled substances distinction was dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.985" offset="9231339">The age of -- that purchasers must be to come within the statute was raise to 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.357" offset="9256835">The disparity between purchaser and seller was removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.471" offset="9273240">Fines -- the fine that would be impose if a distribution were to an adult was enhanced along with imprisonment, and at that time Congress effected a conformity change with respect to -- to special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.104" offset="9331754">Similarly, the history of the second offender provisions which petitioner comments on in -- in his brief are radically different from -- it is radically different from the history of Section 845.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.512" offset="9377416">The second effective provisions under went major rewrites by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.176" offset="9396120">They were revised not only in terms of their language and content, but their structure as well and during the of course of those provisions the -- the conforming change was made in the repeat offenders sections as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.086" offset="9459754">In contrast Section 846, as it appears in Title XXI today, reads the same, line for line, word for word, coma for coma, as the section that was introduced in the initial Government bill back in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.412" offset="9517014">There was an aborted effort at some point to change the word “attempt” to “endeavor,” but that was the single, the sole effort to change even one (Inaudible) of title of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.707" offset="9554213">As result, Congress -- the conspiracy and attempt section became law without Congress have a really focusing on it's -- on its precise language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.568" offset="9593605">Nevertheless, there is -- there -- there can be no question of the intent of Congress to maintain the traditional congruence coterminous between sentences for conspiracy and underlying substantive offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.215" offset="9648253">I've already discussed the -- the structure -- the very structure of statute and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.412" offset="9664972">In addition, simply logic dictates that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.303" offset="9676570">It's inconceivable that Congress considers special parole a needed and appropriate penalty or response to substantive offenses which can -- in fact involve isolated transactions by single individuals, and yet discarded that same remedy for those who act in consort to achieve the same end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.264" offset="9760475">Congress fashioned the -- the remedy of the special parole in order to impose -- post incarceration -- in order to maintain control over the post incarceration conduct persons who -- who engage in drug distribution and in order to serve as a deterrent to repetition of criminal misconduct and it defines common sense to -- to assume, or to believe, or conclude absent some evidence that Congress sought to achieve those -- those objectives only with reference to completed drug distribution offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.234" offset="9888266">Indeed petitioner cited no -- no reason, policy and no reason in logic, why Congress would have wanted to -- would have a purpose to -- propose to treat conspiracy differently than substantive offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.778" offset="9942497">Now, petitioner suggests and I should I understand the argument, but that if one looks at the -- the pattern of -- of substantive offenses to which Congress has assigned the penalty of special parole one can conclude that Congress could not have intended to assign that same penalty to conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.536" offset="10025566">I think this a non sequitur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.512" offset="10037373">First of it -- the question isn't whether given the fact that Congress has a assigned special parole to one substantive offense it sure logically would have assigned it to another substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.437" offset="10081155">The question is whether given the fact that Congress has assigned special parole to particular substantive offense it intended for conspiracy to engage in that precise offense to be similarly punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.441" offset="10133086">But in any event, there is a clear and logical sensible pattern to the -- the man in which Congress assigned special parole even among the substantive offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.322" offset="10168613">Of the nine offense defined in Sections 841 through 844, the four most serious -- most serious that is in terms -- in the sense that they involve trafficking in narcotics and in other easily abusable drugs, those four most se -- the serious offenses mandate in petitioner special parole term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.257" offset="10256384">Now, it's true that the continued criminal enterprise section which is Section 848 does not impose a special parole term, but that's section has a 10-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.203" offset="10312182">It authorizes to a maximum of life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.908" offset="10323048">It authorizes fines up to $100,000 and it provides for forfeiture of -- of profits from any continual criminal enterprise and of any property that is somehow associated with the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.454" offset="10373204">And so in view of that clearly severe set of penalties that the fact that special parole is not among them is valid at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.094" offset="10411760">Petitioner points to two other sections alluded to them in his argument today that petitioner deems equally serious to the ones for which Congress imposed special parole and yet which you don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.753" offset="10466408">One of those sections, Section 841 (d) I believe was not even part of the Drug Abuse Act as passed in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.513" offset="10493471">It was added less than two years ago, less than 15 months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.942" offset="10515101">And it -- by the way, it penalizes possession of piperidine with intent to manufacture phencyclidine which is I guess a more commonly known as angel dust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.615" offset="10561808">That Section 841 (d) was part of an experimental statute as I say passed to some less than two years ago, that was designed to experiment with ways to deter abuse of piperidine and the section includes both criminal and non-criminal ways of trying to deal with this problem and that statute including Section 841 (d) on which the petitioner relies will expire in -- in 1981 by its own terms absent further implementing legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.389" offset="10688972">The other section on which petitioner relies to suggest that that there is little rhyme or reason to the -- the pattern in which the Congress impose special parole is Section 843 which again is different in kind than the sections to which special parole applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.770" offset="10750412">It's a reporting section that has to do with -- parties who are -- are licensed or authorized to dispense narcotics or drugs rather in do so in a flagellant fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.644" offset="10809971">And Congress could quite logically chose to treat those kinds of offenses differently than kinds of offenses that are -- which the Court is concerned.</text>
