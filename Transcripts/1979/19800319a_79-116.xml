            <text syncTime="77.094" offset="411773">Halley I. Thomas, a resident of the District of Columbia since 1949, was hired in 1970 as a heavy laborer by the Washington Gas Light Company in their employment office in Washington, D. C. Although Mr. Thomas occasionally worked in the neighboring jurisdictions of Virginia and Maryland, approximately 60 percent of his duties were performed in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.046" offset="503515">For his endeavors, Mr. Thomas received a paycheck drawn upon a District of Columbia bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.152" offset="523995">On January 22, 1971, Mr. Thomas was breaking concrete with an air hammer in Arlington, Virginia, when he sustained a disabling injury to his back.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.891" offset="566941">Since that date, Mr. Thomas has been unable to return to his occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.809" offset="586585">Prior to his being represented by counsel, Mr. Thomas, while still hospitalized, signed a Virginia agreement for temporary total disability benefits under the Virginia Workmen's Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.447" offset="637158">Mr. Thomas received the Virginia benefits until the maximum amount payable under Virginia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.148" offset="659937">Mr. Thomas is currently without any disability compensation and medical coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.498" offset="681357">Mr. Thomas pursued permanent and total disability benefits in the District of Columbia and received an award which has never been honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.302" offset="712600">The Court is today presented with two independent statutory schemes, each of which has as its purpose the compensation of injured workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.486" offset="753351">The statutes concerned are those of Virginia and the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.381" offset="768920">The compensation statutes in both of these jurisdictions create administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.486" offset="793266">The respective administrative fora do not look north or south or east or west to determine whether a given person is entitled to compensation in that forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.113" offset="4207783">Well, there is a provision in the Longshoremen's Act that appeal should be to the circuit where the injury occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.627" offset="4245922">There is some dispute over exactly what that means, whether it means the District of Columbia Circuit or to interpret it literally, where the injury occurred, but that was not disputed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.481" offset="4305272">Again, McCartin sets out a rule of construction that the Virginia statute must state in unmistakable language that it intends to preclude the District of Columbia award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.962" offset="4351248">Now, the Virginia statute here contains no unmistakable language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.480" offset="4365249">Indeed, it is very similar to the statute that was construed by this Court in McCartin, the Illinois statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.775" offset="4394506">Moreover, to the extent that the Virginia statute gives us any suggestion at all about its views on supplemental awards, we understand that Virginia permits supplemental awards in its own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.917" offset="4447065">That is, if the petitioner here had gone to the District of Columbia first and gotten an award that was less than what he was entitled to in Virginia, it is clear from the Virginia statute that he could have gone to Virginia and supplemented that award up to the benefits that Virginia allows under its statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.913" offset="4527000">So what respondent is asking for is an extremely arrogant interpretation of the Virginia statute and that is that Virginia expects other states to honor the limitations that Virginia puts on its awards, but Virginia will not honor such limitations by other states, and that Virginia expects other states to permit Virginia to give supplemental awards, yet Virginia will not permit other states to give their supplemental awards.</text>

            <text syncTime="2734.753" offset="11042356">I would like to get into a discussion of McCartin, what is good about its, what is right about it, what is constitutional, but I would say that although we don't recommend, I can't tell you to go into looking at the extraterritorial effect of the state legislature of the state statute where it has no power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.923" offset="11127097">I cannot lead you that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.320" offset="11132635">What I can tell you is that the Pettus review -- Pettus v. American Airlines -- reviewed Magnolia and it reviewed McCartin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.271" offset="11168475">It reviewed the statute and the Fourth Circuit interpreted the Virginia statute to be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.491" offset="11197315">This Court, in Butner v. United States in 1979, and Bishop v. Wood, said it gives great deference to the Fourth Circuit in interpreting state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.598" offset="11241723">The state laws in those two cases were North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.804" offset="11254575">The two judges that decided the Pettus case are not only Virginia lawyers but they were educated, they received their legal education in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.648" offset="11302013">On that ground alone, the Fourth Circuit should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.484" offset="11329285">But in Virginia, by law and by usage, Virginia treats a workmen's compensation award exactly the same as it does a judgment, and by law and by usage in Virginia a judgment is res judicata unless timely appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.257" offset="11400443">It was never appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.069" offset="11407653">If Virginia wanted to make an award something less than a judgment, it could easily do so, but it did not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2965.815" offset="11966673">In McCartin, the Court said if it were apparent that an Illinois award was intended to be final and conclusive of all the rights of the employee against the employer, then Magnolia would control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.210" offset="12032188">Beyond its decisive facts, the Magnolia court looked at three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.431" offset="12053086">It looked at the award, its nature and effect, statutory construction and legislative intent, and cases to interpret it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.620" offset="12085896">What are the decisive facts in McCartin?</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.934" offset="12111078">The decisive facts show that there are two simultaneous proceedings going on, one in Illinois and one in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.142" offset="12139917">Wisconsin was studied while awaiting a lump-sum agreement without prejudice to be approved in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.447" offset="12169174">What did Illinois do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.790" offset="12174503">Illinois agreed with this arrangement through one of its commissioners, Mr. Granada, who had apparent authority to approve the express intent of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.592" offset="12221733">The nature of the award was that it was expressly without prejudice to proceed to Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.158" offset="12243989">The effect of the award was that it was not final, it was expressly not final, and so the court in Illinois could not bind the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.478" offset="12281292">I should note that an agreement of this type comes within the exception of res judicata from the restatement of judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.412" offset="12320998">At this point, had the McCartin court given the Illinois award its expressly intended effect, the result would have been the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.215" offset="12368227">But the Court went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.053" offset="12375542">It went into the extraterritorial legislative intent, it found no cases on point, which is not surprising, and it read the statute as non-exclusive to the extent that the McCartin court turned its opinion on the state legislature's intent not to bind a party extraterritorially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.567" offset="12457671">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.317" offset="12464671">No state policy can be greater than that of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.652" offset="12482017">And so it is we believe a strange concept that would permit the Constitution of this country to turn on a state legislature's extraterritorial intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.657" offset="12522036">Such intent is constitutionally meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.770" offset="12534471">The department and Mr. Thomas in their brief and in their reply briefs imply or wish that a state cannot bind a workmen's compensation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.639" offset="12577938">There would be no finality at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.197" offset="12588178">Or alternatively, workmen's compensation cases should be taken out of the full faith and credit clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.097" offset="12619734">If that is so, then the same arguments can be made for any other common law judgment.</text>
