            <text syncTime="23.465" offset="197256">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.178" offset="216064">This is a case which is here on certiorari through the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.708" offset="238216">It is a case in which the District Court awarded attorney's fees against the Petitioner, the Commissioner of the Department of Income Maintenance in his official capacity to be paid out of State funds of the State of Connecticut to the respondent's attorneys in the amount of some $3,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.034" offset="319509">The District Court found the award to be authorized by the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 to the plaintiff as the prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.154" offset="376038">The case was settled by consent decree.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="74.145" offset="399966">Mr. Walsh, looking at page 21A of the petition for certiorari, did their consent decree reserve to the court the right to fix attorney's fees for the plaintiffs in the case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edmund C. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="88.954" offset="459212">It did not, Your Honor, but in all candor it must be said that prior to the entry of the consent decree the State proposed that each party would pay its own costs and the respondents' attorneys refused to agree to that and we decided we would leave it to the District Court when they brought a motion subsequently for attorney's fees.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="110.018" offset="543431">So the State, in effect, consented that after the consent decree was entered a motion for attorney's fees or a new suit for attorney's fees could be brought?</text>

            <text syncTime="121.370" offset="588884">Yes, Your Honor, that is the only way that we could get the consent decree signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.014" offset="607378">We do not agree that attorney's fees were awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.264" offset="616469">We do not agree to awarding of attorney's fees.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="131.985" offset="631306">But you also say that, at least orally, you did not agree that the consent decree settled all the issues in the case, including the issues of whether attorney's fees should be awarded.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edmund_c_walsh" startTime="148.734" stopTime="588.915">
            <label>Mr. Edmund C. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="148.734" offset="698284">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.583" offset="701733">We just apprised the District Court judge of our agreement that we had not remained silent and it was not to be inferred that the agreement was inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.374" offset="740916">In other words, they reserved the right to bring the motion before the court, if I am answering your question correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.350" offset="776756">The Gagne case presents two issues to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.255" offset="792430">The first issue is whether the award is in fact authorized by the Attorney's Fees Awards Act or, conversely, whether or not the Eleventh Amendment prohibits such an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.784" offset="846555">And, secondly, even if the award is authorized -- is not authorized by the Fees Act, whether or not as the Second Circuit has held the award has but the ancillary effect of an award for prospective injunctive relief under Edelman v. Jordan and would not be barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.494" offset="937357">The case began when the respondent, who was a recipient under Connecticut's aid to families with dependent children program, challenged the State's practices and policies with respect to awarding her her employment expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.299" offset="1008619">She was employed at full-time and under the Federal statute, Section 402(a)(7) of the Social Security Act, that statute required that any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of income will be -- must be deducted from a person's gross earnings in computing the amount of their welfare assistance award.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.863" offset="1114781">The respondent claims specifically that the departments imposed a maximum allowance with respect to transportation allowance for her private automobile at 6 cents a mile and a maximum lunch allowance of 50 percents per lunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.351" offset="1188760">She also claimed that they did not allow her certain work-related clothing expenses which she had.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.073" offset="1219688">Before bringing the action the respondent requested and received an administrative fair hearing on these issues of the expenses and the State was upheld on the transportation and lunch expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.286" offset="1288547">It was directed to award her any fee she had for work-related clothing which she could prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.731" offset="1314252">And the fourth issue she brought at the administrative hearing was abandoned when She brought this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.834" offset="1334732">She also claimed she was entitled to deduct her 16-year-old son's working expenses from her award.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.881" offset="1378931">Five months after bringing the suit the State amended its policy which is contained at A66 of the appendix so as to provide expressly that any expenses reasonably attributable to employment were to be allowed to AFDC recipients and the amended policy is at A68 and 69 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.155" offset="1507976">Subsequently, about a year, in September of 1976, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint claiming that the new policy as revised still routinely disallowed expenses of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.497" offset="1577357">Finally, after some discovery, the consent decree was entered into and the District Court I think awaited this Court's decision in Hutto v. Finney and subsequently entered its award of attorney's fees in favor of plaintiff's attorneys of approximately $3,000 as the prevailing party under the Fees Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.807" offset="1686549">The case was appealed to the Second Circuit, the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's award, holding that the Attorney's Fees Award Act authorized a fee payable against the State in a case where the -- a constitutional claim was combined with a statutory claim under 1983 and the case was settled without a final determination on the merits of the constitutional claim so long as there was a common of operative fact between the statutory and the constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.980" offset="1879333">The State claims that the Court of Appeals test which was adopted from the legislative history of the House Report does not meet the requirements of this Court in the case of Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer which held that in order to abrogate the State's Eleventh immunity Congress must be acting pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce a substantive guarantee of that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.691" offset="2018095">It has become clear since this Court decided Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, last June I believe it was, that the respondent, in our view, did not even assert, much less prevail, upon a claim seeking to enforce a substantive guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.787" offset="2106493">We arrived at that conclusion by the fact that in Chapman this Court said that standing alone, section 19(a)(3) confers no substantive rights on a plaintiff's claim and that you must look to the underlying statutory claim then to determine what is the substantive basis of the plaintiff's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.498" offset="2217357">And in this case, the substantive basis of the plaintiff's claim is a claim to enforce a provision of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.029" offset="2263437">What had been somewhat unclear before Chapman was that customarily these claims for welfare, as we call them, were asserted in the format also of a constitutional claim of violations of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.783" offset="2354552">Under the doctrine of Hagans v. Lavine that would confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court to hear the case and unless the claim was wholly insubstantial or frivolous and the court would then proceed to dispose of the statutory claim, in most cases the constitutional claim was never decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.652" offset="2454026">And so we claim --</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="588.915" offset="2459042">Well, what about in a case like that where there is unquestionably a constitutional claim joined with a statutory claim and the Court proceeds to decide the statutory claim, never reaches the constitutional claim, and the plaintiff wins on the statutory claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.529" offset="2529468">Is it your position that no fees are allowable?</text>

            <text syncTime="652.527" offset="2713475">I think, Your Honor, that the legislative history does not support the claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.757" offset="2734373">It may have supported it in Hutto v. Finney.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.554" offset="2745553">That was a case where a constitutional violation was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.899" offset="2763003">In this case there was no constitutional violation found and the legislative history does not address specifically the Eleventh Amendment State immunity but the District Court concluded that on the basis of the House Report which provided that when the claims are combined that an award may be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.614" offset="2849834">But it is our claim that the Congress did not intend or purport to abrogate the threshold requirement of Fitzpatrick, which is that the threshold fact of congressional authorization abrogated State's immunity could only be present when there is authorization of Congress specifically authorizing a suit against the State in a claim and in legislation enacted pursuant to section 5 to enforce the substantive guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.083" offset="2987656">Now, if Congress meant nevertheless to make a pronouncement that we declare we are enforcing a substantive guarantee the Fourteenth Amendment when we say any claim brought under section 1983, I don't think the history justifies that, because I think you must read when it says any claim brought it is implicit that it means any claim brought to enforce civil rights or a substantive guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1006.001" offset="4127326">Now, the respondent has also cited the case of Katzenbach v. Morgan proposition, if I understood him correctly, that Congress -- once Congress has determined that it was acting pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment which has been suggested they said when we enacted 1983 we were acting pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that is not for this Court even to question Congress as to whether or not that was a proper exercise of their power under section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.016" offset="4271417">Mr. Justice Harlan in his dissenting opinion in Katzenbach spoke about that problem, saying that if Congress was making that claim they were claiming they had a right themselves, alone, without review by this Court, to define the substantive scope of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.647" offset="4357935">And Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out if that were the case it would give Congress the right to alter decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.545" offset="4397537">In fact, we think that that is what happened here, in effect the legislative history was used to alter provision of Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer because under this test of a common nucleus of operative fact it isn't essential that Congress be acting pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment; they may be or they may not be; precisely what a common nucleus of operative fact between a statutory claim and a constitutional claim is unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.105" offset="4515819">If the statutory claim itself provided for enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment there would be no problem and there would be no case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.809" offset="4582588">Now, of course the Senate Report in the legislative history points out at page 6342 of the 1977 Congressional notes that the Act is limited to causes arising under our civil rights laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.611" offset="4669837">And of course the purpose of the Act was stated to cure the gaps brought about the Alyeska decision in the award of attorney's fees and civil rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.093" offset="4715708">And so we say Congress only intended when they enacted the Fees Act to authorize fees for claims brought to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment and in this case the plaintiffs were not trying to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment substantive guarantee, although they did recite 1983 and claimed their statutory claim in terms of constitutional due process and equal protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.519" offset="5409416">It seems to me, and I think that the respondent's brief concedes, that this is an extension of the careful definition of what an ancillary effect was in Edelman, and it is an expansion of that doctrine from one which is necessary consequence of compliance with an order for perspective conjunctive relief to a fee awarded in a case brought to obtain an order for prospective conjunctive relief.brought to obtain an order for prospective injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.032" offset="5547551">And so consequently we feel it is not in accord with Edelman v. Jordan, the ancillary effect, and that it should -- consequently for both those reasons the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.661" offset="5629994">And there was a cross appeal which was remanded to the District Court respondent's cross appeal, and that should be -- if the case is dismissed, that should be vacated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1418.856" offset="5778787">My name is Joan Pilver and I represent the respondent Virginia Gagne in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.197" offset="5804178">I would like to begin by offering just a further response to the question posed by Mr. Justice Rehnquist with regard to why the matter of the attorney's fees was not taken up in the consent decree itself, and there are really two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.371" offset="5880874">One, because we felt it would create a potential conflict of interest situation, which we think can arise in any situation where attorney's fees are attempted to be resolved with any consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.767" offset="5942418">The fact that there was a legal dispute between the parties meant that there would have been no way the matter could have been resolved with with any consent decree and, in fact, the entire consent decree would not have been able to have been entered if in fact we had waited -- had insisted on the matter of attorney's fees being in the consent decree itself.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1479.604" offset="6021831">Well, I have been away from the private practice for ten years and perhaps things have changed a good deal since then, but for instance in other Federal statutes like title VII of the Freedom of Information Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act also provide for the award of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.779" offset="6106467">And in the Sixties, at any rate, it was the practice if you were settling a case and the statute authorized an award under which the plaintiff was suing authorized an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party, you settled that at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.999" offset="6203329">That was one of the issues in dispute and if you were going to settle the case, you settled whether or not the person was going to get attorney's fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1532.656" offset="6233945">I think that is a good point, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.924" offset="6243035">However, I would suggest in this particular case the law in this area was very unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.699" offset="6266128">The defendant took the position that as a matter of right we were not entitled -- as a matter of law we were not entitled to attorney's fees, and this was prior to the decision of this Court in Hutto v. Finney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.023" offset="6311476">So it was really a legal decision that had to be made by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.871" offset="6330807">Additionally, I think several courts have expressed the opinion, in particular a recent decision by the Court in Prandini v. National Tea Company, of the various kinds of potential conflicts of interest that can arise when the matter of attorney's fees is settled within the consent decree itself, the fact that some of the substantive provisions in the consent decree can be bargained away in exchange for the attorney's fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.842" offset="6606764">In many of the cases brought under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act the plaintiff will have no fees with which to pay his counsel and the only fee that will be paid will come from the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.844" offset="6650755">So that where the only interest that the plaintiff has is in the substantive settlement and the attorney's interest on the other hand is in the recovering and in that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.214" offset="6860257">I think there is a similarity and I think that kind of approach is very useful to settle the merits of the case first and then allow those other matters to be handled either in a separate negotiation or if they cannot settle it, then to allow it to be decided by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.950" offset="6923160">I think in these kind of cases I think it is really something that should be encouraged because of the potential problems that can arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.089" offset="6971747">Two terms ago this Court in Hutto v. Finney held that Congress has plenary power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment so set aside a State's immunity from retroactive relief and permit an award of attorney's fees to be entered against State officials acting in their official capacity under the Civil rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976.</text>

            <text syncTime="1849.524" offset="7501511">That is true, this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.270" offset="7512482">The Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act itself sets only two criteria that must be met before an award of fees can be made under the discretion of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.800" offset="7558562">One, it must be brought under one of the enumerated statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.201" offset="7572146">And, two, the prevailing party, the person who is seeking the fees must be the prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.761" offset="7602448">We believe that this case meets both criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.317" offset="7616658">It is clear that this case was brought under one of the enumerated statutes, namely 42 U.S.C. 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.212" offset="7648214">The plaintiff alleged constitutional claims which both courts below found to be substantial under the relevant Hagans v. Lavine test, the test which was also suggested by Congress to be used in these kinds of instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.200" offset="7708191">The defendant, however, suggests that this case is not properly brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983 because the plaintiff coupled her constitutional claims with statutory claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.054" offset="7755630">But this Court has yet to hold that a statutory claim may not be properly brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.569" offset="7789693">And even if this Court were to so hold in a future case, it would not be appropriate for decision here because in this case a claim was properly brought under the Constitution, thus bringing it within 42 U.S.C. 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.210" offset="7848208">Additionally, it is very clear from the legislative history that Congress had intended for awards to be made in cases joining constitutional and statutory claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.015" offset="7883421">In the debate and report by Congress it indicated that they wished to continue the practices and judicial standard that had been established prior to the passage of the Fees Awards Act, including the coupling of constitutional and statutory claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.991" offset="7959385">Congress was well aware of the impact that a decision denying fees in cases joining constitutional and statutory claims would have, the fact that plaintiffs would be discouraged from bringing cases if their rights to fees could so easily be defeated, the fact that the inability to award fees in cases joining constitutional and statutory claims might compel judges to unnecessarily decide constitutional questions, thus defeating a very important policy of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.265" offset="8088430">Alternatively, the prospect arises that a plaintiff who believes he has a meritorious statutory claim might refrain from raising it, in the fear that if he were to prevail on the statutory claim he would then be denied fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.592" offset="8145690">This possibility alone would have a very negative impact on the judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.464" offset="8169200">The plaintiff thus maintains that Congress' purpose in passing the Fees Act to encourage the filing of meritorious litigation and the -- under the Fourteenth Amendment -- and the important goals and judicial economy, judicial efficiency and the appropriate adjudication of constitutional questions would all be disturbed if this Court were not to allow fees in cases joining constitutional and statutory claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.885" offset="8270869">Thus the plaintiff believes she meets the first criteria set out in the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.691" offset="8294170">Additionally, she believes that she meets the second criteria, namely that she is the prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.187" offset="8320084">Both courts below believe that the plaintiff had achieved almost all that she had sought in her complaint and that what she had achieved was significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.900" offset="8354983">The Court of Appeals in reviewing the case below concluded that the defendant changed his policies reluctantly and only under the pressure of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.253" offset="8396361">It is vitally important that plaintiffs who settle be treated as prevailing parties for the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.242" offset="8424364">A large percentage of cases that are filed are settled and as an option often thought of and certainly always considered by parties and it would be unfair to deny that option to parties solely for them to be able to insure themselves of a fee award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.918" offset="8487058">Truly, not allowing fees in cases resolved by consent decree would discourage the voluntary settlement of disputes, for as the Court of Appeals suggested it would otherwise require parties to litigate solely to insure fee award.</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.945" offset="8803140">That is right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.864" offset="8810872">That is always done in almost every case that I have ever -- I have ever dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.225" offset="8844309">Further, as I mentioned before, we feel that not allowing fees except in the context of a consent decree could create a potential for conflicts of interest which, you know, as have mentioned and which I think is something that should be considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.368" offset="8912854">Again, the legislative history is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.611" offset="8921840">It indicates that Congress intended fees to be awarded in cases resolved by consent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.287" offset="8948485">Neither would permitting an award of fees in cases resolved by consent further the filing of nuisance litigation, which is certainly of concern to the Court, because it is clear the Court must first find that there is at least a substantial constitutional claim warranting jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.012" offset="9007417">They must find that there were benefits brought about as a result of the settlement and that the benefits that resulted came because of the plaintiff's conduct and would not otherwise have occurred, you know, regardless of the plaintiff's actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.498" offset="9061334">All these are matters that the defendant remains free to contest in any hearing on attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.871" offset="9094875">To require any greater showing would only discourage settlement of disputes and discourage the benefits achieved by settlement, the saving of court time and effort, the saving of time, expense and effort by the litigants, the parties and the attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.937" offset="9163107">To require a greater showing of the likelihood of success on the merits would also require the unnecessary decision of constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.467" offset="9197275">Thus, in sum, the plaintiff believes she meets the two primary criteria set out in the Fees Act for allowing an award of fees to be made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.241" offset="9236355">Because, however, the defendant claims that he is subject to an immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, he asserts that even if we did prevail, even if we are entitled to fees under these two criteria, we are nonetheless barred from an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.133" offset="9315871">The plaintiff believes, however, as mentioned earlier that Hutto v. Finney is the appropriate precedent for deciding this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.166" offset="9344084">The validity of this Court's ruling that in passing the Fees Act Congress was exercising power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment has no less validity in a case resolved by consent than in any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.472" offset="9397269">The legislative history relied upon by this Court in Hutto to come to the conclusion that States were intended to be covered by the Act in this case only but to further by the additional legislative history indicating that these were also intended to be awarded in cases resolved by consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.708" offset="9474173">Certainly the comparison of fees to cost in Hutto and the quotation from Fairmont Creamery Company v. Minnesota that a court interest in expeditious and orderly proceedings justifies it in treating a State as any other litigant has no less validity in a case resolved by consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.212" offset="9560168">Additionally, although not explicitly stated, the plaintiff believes that the Court in Hutto implied strongly that attorney's fees, being so closely akin to cost, that like cost they should not be subject to a State's Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.222" offset="9624221">We believe that a holding by this Court to that effect here would follow logically from this Court's holding in Hutto and would not -- would not strain the distinction drawn by the Court in Edelman v. Jordan between prospective relief and the cost ancillary thereto and retroactively, which is akin to damages and barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.103" offset="9719829">But even if this Court were to hold that attorney's fees are generally subject to the Eleventh Amendment we believe that Congress is acting appropriately under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in passing legislation allowing fees to be awarded in cases resolved by consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.726" offset="9794226">Through extensive hearings Congress was well aware that many parties could not have afford the legal fees involved in bringing action under laws passed pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.375" offset="9844903">And Congress reasonably concluded that shifting the attorney's fee to the losing party was a reasonable way of resolving -- of encouraging such litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.130" offset="9883878">Likewise, Congress was acting reasonably in concluding that an award of fees in consent judgment cases also furthered that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.587" offset="9929749">Congress has acted remedially in giving another tool of use to the Judiciary to use for the process of encouraging the filing of litigation under the Fourteenth Amendment and the tool is as useful in consent judgment cases as in any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.839" offset="9994742">Further, the Act leaves the ultimate decision as to whether to award fees to the discretion of the judge, leaving it to him to decide as here whether there was a substantial constitutional claim justifying a finding of jurisdiction, whether the benefits achieved were valuable and whether they came as a result of the suit having been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.500" offset="10093380">Thus, Congress, even in settle cases, has left the determination and the interpretation of the substantive guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Judiciary, where it rightfully belongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.012" offset="10151372">Thus, the plaintiff below and respondent here believe that the award of fees made by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals was proper under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Act and follows logically from, and is consistent with this Court' holding in Hutto v. Finney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.384" offset="10236949">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2538.677" offset="10258056">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.241" offset="10264325">I have just a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.775" offset="10278431">In Hutto v. Finney this Court stated that attorney's fees may be awarded as part of the costs and the Eleventh Amendment would not seem to be a bar there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.947" offset="10319182">I would respectfully submit that I don't think that the legislative history warranted that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.968" offset="10347290">At least, even if it did in this case, if it is true that the plaintiffs were not seeking to enforce a Fourteenth Amendment guarantee and there is no congressional authorization, even if the Congress has the power to give such authorization under the Fees Awards Act, this Court distinguished Hutto --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2585.818" offset="10446660">Well, can I interrupt you on the question of whether the legislative history supports the notion that fees might be awarded as part of the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.708" offset="10482186">I think the statute itself, which you quote on pages 3 and 4 of your brief, ends up by saying that a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.478" offset="10533282">Doesn't that kind of imply that it is supposed to be part of the costs?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edmund_c_walsh" startTime="2610.508" stopTime="2821.358">
            <label>Mr. Edmund C. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="2610.508" offset="10545403">Yes, Your Honor, but is it part of the cost where the Eleventh Amendment is not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.228" offset="10572257">We see the Fees Act, the purpose of the Act and the policy of the Act all indicated that they were not enacting any startling new legislation, it was just to fill gaps created by the Alyeska decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.275" offset="10640488">Now, actually the costs have not been changed since think the Judiciary Act of 1853 and so if that was their intention, I think that would have been more than just no startling new remedy legislation and just to fill in the gaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.309" offset="10708616">But in a case where civil rights are not being enforced there is no authorization, I think, in the legislative history specifically to abrogate that amendment in a non-civil rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.082" offset="10771728">Congress doesn't claim such a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.550" offset="10785520">It may have such power, but it doesn't claim it in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.686" offset="10802134">I want to make one other point and that is that Hutto itself distinguished Fitzpatrick from Edelman and it said Fitzpatrick begins where Edelman ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.770" offset="10870471">But this case is very similar to Edelman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.496" offset="10885308">There was a constitutional claim in Edelman of equal protection and there was statutory social security claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.800" offset="10918536">So I think it would be fair to say that Edelman controls this case and that this case ends where Edelman ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.507" offset="10949360">And Fitzpatrick began where there was a threshold question of congressional authorization, which isn't present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.186" offset="10980080">I would just like to make one other remark to Mr. Justice Marshall's earlier question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.935" offset="11007143">My point was that Chapman says there is no jurisdiction under U.S. Code 1343 for 1344 to hear a case in which there is just statutory claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.477" offset="11081331">And so it may well be that in this case we have what Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out in his dissent in the decision of Employees, a constitutional claim which the Federal District Court does not have jurisdiction over because Congress has not given, only implemented its Article 3 power to award that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.116" offset="11175790">With respect to Mr. Justice Blackmun's remarks about being a customary provision, a boiler plate, if you will, we would just point out that there was only one single plaintiff throughout the entire more than two years of litigation in this and that the plaintiff in the consent decree did not obtain the injunctive relief which he sought; she did not obtain the equivalent of the injunctive relief she sought, because the State did not change its amended policy, it is still in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.279" offset="11300446">That is the one contained in the appendix at paragraph -- pages 68 and 69.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.260" offset="11328449">So we think that Edelman v. Jordan should be controlling in this case because it is so similar to Edelman v. Jordan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.401" offset="11365021">And for that reason we ask that the Court reverse the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.933" offset="11383097">Thank you very much.</text>
