            <label>Mr. Donald O. Meserve</label>
            <text syncTime="53.146" offset="315956">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.401" offset="332988">This case here on certiorari raises really four issues, the first being whether the District Court erred in giving declaratory judgment, that the Board of Regents had violated Mary Tomanio's civil rights by not giving her a hearing; the second being the extent to which the District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals should have been bound by the New York State Court's interpretation of state law; and the other two being a unique interpretation of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals with respect to the defenses of res judicata and the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.889" offset="522951">Since this is a due process case, I think it is important to start with a brief outline of the essential facts to which that due process has got to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.833" offset="578748">Mary Tomanio practiced chiropractic in the state of New York for a few years before the first chiropractic licensing statute was enacted, effective in July 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.343" offset="632769">When that statute came into effect, it provided a special means of qualification for what were called grandfather applicants which was intended to take into account the fact that they had been out of school for a while and that they had been acquiring valuable experience through actual practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.895" offset="718973">A limited series of four special examinations was provided for the grandfather applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.631" offset="753873">At the time the class action was brought contesting the constitutionality of the licensing statute, Wasmuth v. Allen, cited in our brief, and the New York Court of Appeals sustained the statute and the appeal to this Court was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.531" offset="821478">Subsequently, the four examinations originally contemplated were extended to five and then to six special examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.796" offset="858572">Mrs. Tomanio had made her application in the normal source of events for licensure, was admitted to the series of special examinations, took and failed all six of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.003" offset="911339">As a result of retaining credit for subjects passed in previous exams and as a result of grade averaging within a group of subjects, her final margin of failure on the sixth and last examination was six-tenths of one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.456" offset="985213">At this point, it is our contention that she had failed to qualify under a valid and constitutional licensing scheme and at this point if there were no move New York statutes involved, the Circuit Court would have agreed that her previous right to practice chiropractic had expired by the result of her failure on the examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.476" offset="1097226">However, in New York we have an article of omnibus provisions which apply to all of the thirty professions licensed by the Board of Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.853" offset="1142784">These are in addition to the special provisions set forth in the separate article for each of the professions.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.490" offset="1177370">One of the omnibus provisions which has been in effect for many years provides that the Board of Regents may waive a specific licensing requirement if they are satisfied that it has been substantially met.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.696" offset="1246124">After failing the examination route under the chiropractic article, After failing the examination rule under the chiropractic article, Dr. Tomanio applied for a waiver of her failure on the examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.192" offset="1296175">This was denied by the department, and that was in November of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.249" offset="1336404">She subsequently instituted a state court action contending that the denial was arbitrary and capricious and that the statute required the regents to consider her failure and her narrow margin of failure on the examination and her licensure in two other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.369" offset="1432848">The Supreme Court of the State of New York at special term granted judgment from the bench for Mrs. Tomanio.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.429" offset="1461060">No decision was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.126" offset="1471927">The Board of Regents appealed and that judgment was unanimously reversed by the appellate division.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.670" offset="1498049">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, it was unanimously dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.949" offset="1515186">So that all of the I believe 11 appellate judges in the State of New York dismissed her action.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.574" offset="1557713">So then in June of 1976 she initiated an action in the District Court in which she requested a mandatory order directing licensure, an injunction against interference with her right to practice, and a declaration that her civil rights had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.771" offset="1654471">The first two elements of relief, the real relief which she requested, namely licensure and the right to practice were identical to those which had been raised in the state case.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.910" offset="1698983">There had been no mention of section 1983 or federal civil rights in the prior state court actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.980" offset="1735241">The Federal District Court denied the request for licensure, denied the request for an injunction against interference with her practice, but did give judgment that the Board of Regents had violated her civil rights through the failure to offer her a hearing on her application for a waiver of the examination failures and in failing to give her the reasons for the denial of her application.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.136" offset="1871914">The petitioner appealed from that decision, no cross-appeal was filed, and the licensure and practice issue therefore are not before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.516" offset="2141393">I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="511.714" stopTime="523.148">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="511.714" offset="2150275">Well, my understanding of the New York rule of collateral estoppel is that anything that was litigated or might have been litigated is barred in a subsequent lawsuit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_o_meserve" startTime="523.148" stopTime="834.834">
            <label>Mr. Donald O. Meserve</label>
            <text syncTime="523.148" offset="2195937">Yes, we did make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.621" offset="2237837">With respect to the question of due process, this was first raised of course in the federal action four years after the final determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.572" offset="2297710">In the letter of November 1971 notifying Mrs. Tomanio of the denial of her waiver application, and incidentally notifying her that she was admitted to the regular licensing examination, she was informed that if she had any questions she could contact the executive secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.597" offset="2385795">The letter did not go on at that time to give written reasons for the denial of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.898" offset="2410977">However, three months later, in February 1972, in our first response to the state court litigation, those reasons were given in writing and in full, therefore she had notice of the reasons for the denial of her application in writing over four years before the institution of this federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.160" offset="2528005">And I would submit that that issue really is and was academic four years before the case began.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.795" offset="2570533">Furthermore, this is not a type of a case where the Board of Regents was doing something to Mary Tomanio, but a case where she had failed to qualify under the statute regulating her profession and then applied arguing that she had the substantial equivalent of the statutory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.400" offset="2664991">That application was judged solely on the basis of the material which she submitted and which was accepted at face value.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.148" offset="2703966">She knew the basis of her argument and she was represented by an attorney from the beginning of the application to the department, I believe, and there is really no question that she had had reasons for denial of her application from the beginning in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.173" offset="2800097">With respect to the hearing, the federal district court judge and the majority of the circuit court held that she should have been given a formal hearing on her application for waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.674" offset="2862059">Now, there is no statutory provision for such, no hearing was requested by her at any time although she was represented by an attorney throughout, and this Court, as a matter of fact, had not yet decided Roth and Sinderman.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.019" offset="2923499">So we are being hit with a bit of a lack of anticipation of the decisions of this Court when you put this into the perspective of 1971 when the decision was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.621" offset="2985880">Secondly, any right to practice which she may have had had been terminated in our opinion by her failure to qualify by passing one of the series of special examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.055" offset="3059545">She had no reasonable expectation, much less a mutual expectation that the state would waive a requirement if she proved unable to meet it.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.988" offset="3115342">And I don't think that the subsequent application under those circumstances continued a right or should have been construed as having reinstated the right really for purposes of considering the due process to which she was entitled on the second application.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.788" offset="3198516">I think the court below erred in lumping the original licensing application and the waiver application together.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.071" offset="3235610">We would also argue that she had in effect due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.865" offset="3262882">As I said before, she was represented by an attorney in the waiver application, she had a full opportunity to present her arguments in writing and she had to and they were simply that she had almost passed, she was licensed in two other states, a standard which we did not regard as equivalent, and she had passed a private licensing examination which the state also did not accept as equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.119" offset="3387852">She was given eventually the reasons for denial and she had a fully adequate record for judicial review which is proven by the fact that it was in fact reviewed, and the state courts found that she did not have the substantial equivalent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.254" offset="6816371">In 1971, when the legislature in its wisdom chose to pass a law called 7606, which was revision of a law that was on the books since 1939, they gave an opportunity to all citizens of the State of New York to go to the regents and request of them a waiver of their background requirements for license, of their education requirements for a license, and for the examination requirements in whole or in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.890" offset="6974882">Previous to this law, they had 211 in which the legislature of the New York in its wisdom said that only outsiders, people who have been practicing for five years in a given profession may come to the State of New York and show the Board of Regents that that five years of practice and what came before it would be sufficient to warrant an acceptance by the Board of Regents that they substantially complied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.816" offset="7114585">When 6506 came around, it was on the books for five weeks before Mary Tomanio took advantage of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.008" offset="7147395">It was the first time it was on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.020" offset="7155440">They open now this application for showing whether they substantially complied or not to citizens of the State of New York and to people for the first time who failed examinations, and it is quoted here in clear English.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.178" offset="7228061">Now, that decision of the Board of Regents was an adjudicative decision and the process that Mary Tomanio used, going up through the state court, was one to determine if that adjudicative decision was arbitrary or capricious.</text>
