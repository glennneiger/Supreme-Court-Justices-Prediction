            <text syncTime="57.269" offset="332466">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.218" offset="344273">This case comes to the Court on stipulated facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.583" offset="357752">The case involves the constitutionality of California's Revenue and Taxation Code, Section 225.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.381" offset="384920">That statute was enacted in 1975, following attempts by the assessors in California to impose the personal property tax on imported goods held in the State that had long been considered immune under the original package doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.852" offset="450748">In order to avoid and prevent the diversion of import business from California to other States that offered more attractive tax laws, California enacted this exemption which applied to imported goods held in the State for shipment to other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.562" offset="517622">The respondents here have attacked the statute as being unconstitutional, alleging that the exemption that was extended to imported goods held for shipment out of the State must also be extended to interstate goods travelling through the State as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.034" offset="583555">On the tax rule date, in 1976, the petitioner held imported goods in a warehouse in the State of California for shipment out of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.961" offset="627231">These are precisely the type of goods that are exempt under Section 225.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew S. Garb</label>
            <text syncTime="161.681" offset="750111">Certainly; let me address myself at this time to that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.147" offset="764008">We're in an interesting situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.209" offset="772159">There is no evidence in this case that any shipper of interstate goods has ever been injured by this statute; indeed, we know of no lawsuit brought by any interstate shipper to complain about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.630" offset="817925">We rather have ourselves in a rather anomalous situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.877" offset="830882">We have the County of Los Angeles, which is the revenue collecting authority arguing here that its parent, the State of California, that enacted an exemption statute, didn't go far enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.966" offset="879261">And what they're contending here is that the statute should have gone further and exempted more goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.836" offset="906742">Therefore, we have the kind of situation where there is no injured party, no evidence of actual injury to anyone in a protected class who has ever brought a case of this sort.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="212.749" stopTime="216.553">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="212.749" offset="954389">Certainly no more than injury in fact, at most.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_s_garb" startTime="216.553" stopTime="392.317">
            <label>Mr. Andrew S. Garb</label>
            <text syncTime="216.553" offset="969540">We have even no injury in fact, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.579" offset="977690">What we had in the Court of Appeals was an invalidation of this statute based on certain assumptions, certain assumed competition between goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.708" offset="1018232">And we submit not only that there was no evidence that these assumptions in fact exist in fact; but moreover, the hypothetical construct, the abstraction that was relied upon by the Court of Appeals was in fact erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.709" offset="1070164">And if I may address myself to that for a moment, the concept that was created by the Court of Appeals to invalidate the statute was a suggestion that somehow the Revenue and Taxation Code, Section 225, affords a competitive advantage to imported goods, when they compete with similar domestic goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.271" offset="1148426">Now, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out, not only is there no evidence of such competition in fact, but we submit that that construct is erroneous for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.920" offset="1195029">First, we have many States in this country that have so-called free port laws; roughly three-quarters of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.330" offset="1224704">None of these free port laws exempt locally manufactured goods that are sold within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.162" offset="1248005">Very few of those statutes exempt locally manufactured goods that are shipped to other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.525" offset="1269426">Accordingly, imported goods that are exempt under these other free port States compete with domestic goods that have been taxed, either in those States or in other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.964" offset="1315192">The same type of competitive advantage that is alleged to exist as a result of 225 exists as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.857" offset="1342777">And independent of that, we have as a corollary of our Federal system the fact that States have broad autonomy to fashion their own tax systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.959" offset="1379244">Indeed, we have States such as New York that have decided to impose no personal property tax whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.832" offset="1402650">Therefore, when goods are imported through New York, and compete with domestic goods in other States which have been subjected to tax in those other States, as a result of the interaction between the New York statute and the other states' tax laws, the imported goods that were free of tax that came from New York again have precisely the same type of competitive advantage that 225 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code is alleged to afford.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.293" offset="1504528">Now, if this type of advantage is perceived as an evil, it cannot be eradicated by striking Section 225.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.223" offset="1536293">In fact, it could not even be eradicated by striking the free port acts of three-quarters of the States in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.280" offset="1560534">We would submit that this problem--if this situation is perceived as a problem, the only solution would be for Congress to impose uniformity and require that all States either refrain from taxing personal property completely, or that all States tax at precisely the same rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.905" offset="1639006">And this, we would submit, goes far beyond anything that this Court has ever held or suggested; and indeed, flies in the face of basic principles of federalism in our country.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.375" offset="2020916">One last point that I would like to make on the matter that we were discussing, and that is this, that we also feel that it is very unlikely that these differences in State tax laws are even taken into account by Congress and the President in fashioning tariffs, as was suggested by the Court of Appeals and is relied upon by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.696" offset="2094164">For as I have said, when we have some States that impose no property tax at all, other States that may tax at a high rate, other States that have different exemptions from each other, it seems to be virtually an impossibility for Congress to take this potpourri of laws into effect in fashioning tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.995" offset="2163336">And even if they could somehow do that, since there are changes in these laws from time to time, it would require an almost constant monitoring by Congress of these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.816" offset="2202624">And for that reason, we also believe that this abstraction by the Court of Appeals is erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.074" offset="2263646">But why can't they argue that the exemption itself is unconstitutional; if you eliminate the exemption, you'll also eliminate the disparity.</text>

            <text syncTime="995.970" offset="4087202">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.566" offset="4101622">Speaking for the United States as amicus in this case, we believe there is no substantial basis for a constitutional challenge to Section 225 of California's Revenue and Taxation Code; and that it is the interest of the United States that it be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.141" offset="4187930">This is not a case, as many cases involving State taxation that have come to this Court are, as the Court has described them, cases where the legitimate interests of a State--financial, fiscal, or in other cases, health--point in one direction, and the interest of the Federal government in free and open trade points in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.504" offset="4301406">Here, they coincide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.279" offset="4312482">And California, perhaps recognizing that great cities grow and develop at points of transshipment, seeking to remove obstacles that this Court in Michelin said were tolerable, but nevertheless, burdens to some extent; seeking to remove obstacles that New York removes, the first port of the country, removes by statute, in providing against any taxation of personal property on an ad valorem basis; that Louisiana, the second port of the country most of the time, gives a much broader exemption even than California, to imported goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.206" offset="4500146">California moves in this area to remove this obstacle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.018" offset="4531493">Now, the Court below invoked two grounds, one, a certain inconsistency which it asserted with the tariff laws; with respect -- that seems almost fanciful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.056" offset="4607561">The Congress is certainly aware of the patchwork of State property tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.627" offset="4637863">Over the years, their non-uniformity from the extreme of New York on down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.468" offset="4661269">And of the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.889" offset="4674957">If the tariff laws were affected, this would freeze all State statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.380" offset="4712887">Rates couldn't be changed; exemptions couldn't be changed one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.365" offset="4740786">More than that, there's really no correlation between tariff statutes and these annual property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.966" offset="4775267">The tariff is imposed on all goods, dutiable goods, that come into the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.996" offset="4807346">Property taxes may or may not affect any goods that come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.890" offset="4826885">They may be consumed before the annual tax day, which varies from State to State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.182" offset="4852067">They may run, as it were, a slalom course around -- between the property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.521" offset="4881429">Or on the other hand, they may label and be taxed more than once.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.118" offset="4903894">But there's no correlation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.050" offset="4915597">And as I say, the other argument would require that these be frozen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.494" offset="4941302">The second ground asserted by the State is discrimination which has been discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.370" offset="4968887">And discrimination is not an abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.014" offset="4987382">And if we assume that California rather than an interstate shipper can invoke this -- statutes, Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe are not held unconstitutional in the abstract; someone who is hurt usually has to invoke the specific grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.044" offset="5059584">I heard something in the argument that just preceded us on a very different basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.776" offset="5082467">But in any event here, during a hundred years, while this Court held that goods--imports in their original package were exempt from property tax, it was also holding--in fact, for four years before Low v. Austin, in Woodruff v. Parham, that interstate goods in their original package were not exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.848" offset="5190719">Now, I can hardly believe that the Court, having formed, perhaps erroneously as it has recently held, an exemption for interstate goods would tolerate this discrimination if it were an unconstitutional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.617" offset="5261876">So that I think the Court would be reluctant to impose upon its predecessors for a hundred years this unconstitutional -- not erroneous, but unconstitutional action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.627" offset="5317883">Moreover, the Federal statute on air transportation creates the same differentiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.356" offset="5352782">It taxes interstate air transportation and domestic, but not foreign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.548" offset="5385592">So we have a parallel in Congressional action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.395" offset="5408998">More than that, this Court has frequently -- and as pointed out, as recently as last term in Japan Lines -- pointed out the preeminence of the Federal interest in foreign commerce, while nothing that the control of interstate commerce is more a matter -- shared with the States and the Federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.175" offset="5516100">And this differentiation has existed throughout; the Court itself in a number of instances has differentiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.125" offset="5547865">The impact of the 21st amendment is only one situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.078" offset="5567718">So this discrimination -- I prefer to say differentiation -- is one widely recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.861" offset="5606797">And before it is taken as a basis for invalidating action that parallels the Federal action and is in the Federal interest, it should be shown, we believe, to have adversely affected someone who is engaged in interstate commerce; not someone merely who would seek to increase the revenues of a county as opposed to the action of that State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.106" offset="7103822">And as a matter of fact, they had named a former assessor, and we felt that rather than having the former assessor's name on because of certain political considerations, we thought it would be better if we simply had it in the entities that were required to be sued by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.961" offset="7167248">I should point out, Your Honor, that Revenue Taxation Code Section 538, which was described in our response to a petition for a hearing before the State Supreme Court, has been enacted by the legislature, largely in response to the Section -- to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.293" offset="7260557">And that Section reads that the statute charges -- I'm sorry, the section charges assessors for leaving a state tax, or a state exemption, to be unconstitutional, quote -- those assessors -- shall, in lieu of making such an assessment bring an action for declaratory relief against the State Board of Equalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.759" offset="7346448">And the legislative analyst, in describing that statute for the legislature, gave exactly the same rendition of the assessor's requirements to follow the constitution as the Court of Appeals did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.460" offset="7397230">In essence, the State legislature has recognized the authority of the County to bring an action to declare invalid under the constitution a state exemption; and at the same time, recognized the previous authority of the assessor to render the assessment in view of his own belief, as the constitutional problem.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Dexter Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="1905.235" offset="7724283">Well, Your Honor, it seemed to me anomalous to -- on the fact that I foolishly stipulated out the assessor's name, because it was not required by the State statute, to say that the people involved do not have standing to raise constitutional issues, even when that has been recognized specifically by the State legislature, which I recognize that you are telling me that under Doremus would be irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.275" offset="7816443">But my feeling is, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the whole idea of the Board of Education v. Allen does stand for the proposition that when the officer is sworn to uphold the constitution, and makes that decision, that I believe the entity which is sued for the repayment of taxes, and certainly there are individuals involved, and certainly the assessor is going to comply with whatever decision comes down, and the tax collector and all the other individuals involved will do so as well; that they are so intimately wound up, as the Court of Appeals has determined, with the entity being sued itself, that the entity is entitled to raise that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.669" offset="8002017">The basic issue on the merits is whether the states can regulate imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.326" offset="8024691">There are three reasons why we believe this to be improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.763" offset="8038379">We believe that Section 225 impinges on the area of free trade, which was defined by this Court in Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.147" offset="8071920">We believe that it invades the area of the Federal exclusive right to regulate imports, not only to insure their uniformity, and--but also to, as this Court said in Board of Trustees v. U.S., describe the extent to which the tariff regulations go; that precise extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.162" offset="8163976">And also, 225 we believe to be precluded by the Tariff Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.915" offset="8182993">The petitioner suggests different issues, in essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.461" offset="8197204">He suggests that there are, quote, no facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.112" offset="8223848">The Court of Appeals accepted the petitioner's request that this statute have a broad interpretation; and yet the petitioner seeks to avoid the ambit of that broad interpretation as described and found by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.916" offset="8299081">The first answer to the petitioner's contention is that American Oil applies, pure and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.333" offset="8324681">The second answer is that there are facts in this particular case which show that Section 225 yields non-conformity in tariff regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.484" offset="8381315">Goods which derive from the same manufacturer, which are held after the same foreign commerce, and which are held in the same warehouse, but which are eventually sold to a Phoenix customer, are treated differently for their temporary storage than if they go to a Sacramento customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.380" offset="8460936">225 tells the foreign manufacturer, "If you are lucky enough to sell to somebody in Phoenix, you're in great shape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.120" offset="8491865">But if you're unlucky enough to sell to somebody in Sacramento, you lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.032" offset="8503463">I'm sorry."</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.610" offset="8509837">We paint this picture because of the conditions in Section 225, which reach beyond the California border, and encourage and discourage certain activities in foreign countries, and in other States, merely on the basis of their temporary presence in the taxing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.839" offset="8582771">On the export side, we tell a Pittsburgh manufacturer via Section 225 who brings his goods into the State for sale, or who may bring those goods into the State, or who is thinking about bringing those goods into the State, that if he sells to a foreign customer, that's fine; he will not be taxed on the basis of that temporary presence in the State; but if he sells to an Hawaiian customer, he loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.643" offset="8693948">Section 225 thereby creates a pricing regulation for the interstate customer of foreign and interstate goods, and also, imposes a regulation on that Pittsburgh manufacturer who is thinking of bringing of his goods into the State for temporary storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.150" offset="8759986">It says, in essence, we're going to treat these things separate simply because it's within our power to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.263" offset="8784436">Now, the petitioners have suggested that this is all saved for various reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.426" offset="8809096">They suggest that they can avoid the appellate court finding, because the appellate court finding doesn't apply to Sears; that the appellate court should have found the statute constitutional as to Sears, but unconstitutional as to Z Toys, because Z Toys did have the facts with regard to distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.757" offset="8886418">This case was consolidated below without objection, and the Court of Appeals found that the ambit of the statute--and defined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.441" offset="8921109">Now the petitioner seeks to avoid that ambit, even though it asserted that it could go forward with the broad interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.240" offset="8960293">The idea, then, of validating Section 225 because it prefers foreign goods over interstate goods, is to my way of thinking, equally invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.123" offset="9011911">It is invalid because Section 225 distinguishes between foreign goods; it does not even support all foreign goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.276" offset="9048482">Any product which is brought into the State of California from Japan, which is quote manufactured, and I respectfully direct the attention of the Court to the definition of manufacturing, or the exemption-- or the exception to the definition of manufacturing in Section 225, which in essence states that if you can label those goods in California, and they will not be taxable, but you paint them and they will be taxable, even though they arrive at the same interstate customer's location; even though they are produced in the beginning by the same foreign manufacturer; and even though they are brought into the State by the same method of transportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.461" offset="9537181">Well, I think that's one of the vices of it, because it makes the tariffs--in essence, it gives a tariff rebate to one set of foreign goods and doesn't give it to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.086" offset="9571767">And I think that can be reached from the stipulated facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.702" offset="9590157">If American Oil does not apply, if the language of the statute is not seen in and of itself -- that these extra-territorial conditions are not seen in and of themselves as an invasion of free trade (Boston Stock Exchange), and if it is not seen as a deprivation of the Federal government's right to regulate imports (Board of Trustees v. Illinois), and if it is not seen as a conflict with the Tariff Acts, then the stipulated facts do support the distinction that is made between foreign goods, which makes them un-uniform, which is contrary to the Tariff Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.721" offset="9722232">And as we pointed out in our brief, there's a specific section which requires uniformity of tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.335" offset="9744697">I do not believe that we can one way suggest, as the Federal government has suggested here, that because the Federal government's current policy is to help certain foreign interests, that is, the airplane flights, that suddenly all States can enact this same kind of exemption that cuts across these same lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.745" offset="9834350">What that does is effectively open the doors to any interest groups supporting foreign manufacturers, and close them to our own domestic manufacturers, because the Solicitor General has also suggested that any regulation which hurts foreign commerce is a bad thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.911" offset="9903000">We can't do that, I think, and still retain the kind of ability that this country has to have a system which is uniform, a system which operates on perhaps the kinds of goods differently; that is, if we say we have a timber exemption, or a different rate for cattle, as Wisconsin does for different kinds of goods, those statutes on their face do not cut across these lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.780" offset="10022536">But Section 225, and its extra-territorial conditions, do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.101" offset="10039777">On its face, in the context of Article XIII, Section 1, of the State constitution, which requires all property in the State to be taxed, those selective encouragements and discouragements of foreign and interstate activity operate as inhibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.694" offset="10106128">And I respectfully refer the Court to footnote 13 of the Boston Stock Exchange opinion, which talk about those particular kinds of inhibiting effects of State taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.670" offset="10150013">The language itself of this statute directs--actually cuts against the Federal government's ability to determine the extent to which tariff regulations act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew S. Garb</label>
            <text syncTime="3228.327" offset="13016691">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.033" offset="13023483">I would like to make a couple of comments concerning the repeal of the California inventory tax that we pointed out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.389" offset="13056920">First, I would like to point out that this case continues to have importance to California taxpayers, since we have a statute which was in effect for four years, and we have a four-year period within which to bring claims for refund in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.585" offset="13117733">The outcome of this case is of great importance to California taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.516" offset="13133406">In addition, since the respondents have taken the position here that statutes are invalid that exempt locally, but to fail to exempt locally manufactured goods, as respondents have now argued, and have argued in their briefs, since none of the other 36 States that have free port laws exempt locally manufactured goods sold in the State, the outcome of the constitutional issue asserted by respondents in this case, is of major importance to the statutes of those other 36 States as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.839" offset="13258689">With respect to this pending refund statute, as we pointed out in our brief, the California constitution has a doctrine that prohibits the legislature from enacting a statute which constitutes a gift of public funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.930" offset="13319084">And in a long series of cases, dating back to the last century, cited in our brief, that constitutional provision has been applied with respect to accrued tax liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.347" offset="13360776">For that reason it appears very likely that any attempt to refund taxes, if indeed this -- the decision of the Court of Appeals is upheld, would violate the California constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.287" offset="13404557">I am advised that the State of Utah had a similar situation in which a refund was attempted after the repeal of a tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.922" offset="13435068">And there, as well, the repeal -- after the repeal, the refund was held to be beyond the power of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.123" offset="13463907">I would like to move for a moment to the uniformity argument mentioned by respondents in oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.716" offset="13494209">And I think we have a bit of confusion here, because what the constitution requires is uniformity of tariff rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.013" offset="13523466">The have somehow twisted that constitutional requirement of uniform tariff rates to suggest that State property taxes have to be uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.039" offset="13559515">And yet we know that, even though we have uniform tariff rates, we have different State property tax laws that obviously are going to have a different impact on imported goods and domestic goods as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.122" offset="13599848">And accordingly, the suggestion that there's a constitutional requirement of uniformity in tariffs simply cannot be stretched to suggest the requirement of uniform State property tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.019" offset="13647496">Next, I would like to make a comment again on this argument that Section 225 constitutes a rebate of tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.806" offset="13678634">We're already, in my opening, given about three reasons why this is invalid, and a fourth one comes to mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.411" offset="13704965">In fact, when the Tariff Acts that counsel has now stated he relies upon were enacted, goods of substantially the same type as those involved in this case were immune from State taxation under the original package doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.157" offset="13760031">When Section 225 was enacted, it preserved the nontaxable status of these very goods; and accordingly, when Congress set the level of protection that it intended to create for domestic manufacturing, that same level of protection was perpetuated precisely by Section 225.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.529" offset="13829517">So for that reason as well, the major premise of respondent's argument on this supposed tariff reduction is simply erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.502" offset="13861386">And as I listened to the oral arguments of respondents, and heard the extension to which their argument is now taken, that the commerce clause should even invalidate State laws that do not exempt locally manufactured goods sold locally, it strikes, me, first of all, that that runs counter to Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, which validated such treatment on equal protection grounds; and Alaska v. Arctic Maid, which permitted a State to tax locally competing industries more onerously than interstate competing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.337" offset="14008717">But in addition, it probably does suggest, as Mr. Justice White was questioning me in my opening, that where you have a party who is contending -- a tax collecting agent who is contending that the proper way to handle this is to exempt more goods, it seems very likely that you may not have a case or controversy at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.121" offset="14087816">Thank you very much.</text>
