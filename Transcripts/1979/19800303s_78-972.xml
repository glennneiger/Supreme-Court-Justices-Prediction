            <text syncTime="26.114" offset="104385">In United States against Apfelbaum, the question is whether a witness granted use immunity under Section 6002 may subsequently be prosecuted for false statements made during the course of his immunized testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.375" offset="185469">Here, respondent Apfelbaum invoked his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination while being questioned before a grand jury in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.431" offset="225698">The District Judge granted him immunity under the statute and ordered him to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.165" offset="248581">During his testimony, Apfelbaum made statements to serve as the basis for his subsequent indictment and conviction for false swearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.518" offset="290064">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the conviction because of the District Court admitted into evidence relevant portion of Apfelbaum's grand jury testimony that had not been alleged in the indictment to constitute the corpus delicti or core of the false statements offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.066" offset="376163">We disagree with the Court of Appeals' holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.391" offset="389538">We hold that neither the statute nor the Fifth Amendment requires that -- an admissibility of immunized testimony be governed by any different rules than other testimony at a trial for making false statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.848" offset="447321">Section 6002, the statute explicitly accepts prosecutions for perjury and for making false statements from the scope of its immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.476" offset="489848">The statute makes no distinction between statements alleged as the corpus delicti or core of the offense and other statements made during the giving of immunized testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.277" offset="541048">In the legislative history of the statute shows that Congress intended perjury and false declarations exceptions to be interpreted as broadly as constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.786" offset="595069">The Fifth Amendment privilege against self -- compulsory self-incrimination does not limit that statute here because the privilege does not extend to hazards of incrimination that are merely trifling or imaginary.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.145" offset="656509">Rather the hazard must be substantial and real at the time a witness asserts the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.659" offset="682632">At the time a witness, the respondent assert his Fifth Amendment privilege, he had neither committed the false swearing offense of which he was later convicted nor had he taken any active steps that would suggest he was committed to make the false statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.522" offset="746057">Indeed at this point he could have done no more than formulate a future intent to commit perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.989" offset="779912">This hazard is not by itself sufficient to justify invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.907" offset="819618">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.157" offset="836545">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.489" offset="857861">Mr. Justice Blackmun joined by Mr. Justice Marshall has also filed a separate opinion concurring only in the judgment -- concurring and dissenting.</text>
