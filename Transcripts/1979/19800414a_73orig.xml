            <text syncTime="15.231" offset="164342">The State of Nevada submits that the real issue in this case is whether California and Nevada in 1863 constitutionally set their joint State boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.458" offset="205197">Nevada submits that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.819" offset="214601">The second question is assuming that boundary was constitutionally set, that the United States, whether they had the power to move it onto a new land.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.896" offset="258905">Nevada submits that the United States did not have this power under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.224" offset="276250">Nevada does concede that if this were a proper case for application of the doctrine of acquiescence that Nevada has acquiesced in the present marked lines, the lines recommended by the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.145" offset="331943">We submit that this is not a case for the application of the doctrine of acquiescence, because to apply the doctrine in this case would confer upon the Executive branch of the Government the power to act upon State boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.837" offset="390771">And this Court in Rhode Island v. Massachusetts many years ago said.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.304" offset="408639">"There can be but two tribunals under the Constitution who can act on the boundaries of States, the legislative or the judicial power, the former is limited, in express terms, to assent or dissent, where a compact or agreement is referred to them" -- meaning Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.992" offset="611349">We contend that the failure of the power of the United States to move the boundary goes to California's claim of right in which acquiescence has always been applied on the claim of right in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.107" offset="655757">In all the boundary decisions of this Court there has always been an enabling Act or something of that nature, a concession from Virginia to the United States, a monument of title, a color of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.747" offset="706330">And California, we contend, does not have that because they claim the United States has wrongfully moved, taken part of Nevada and given it to California.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.309" offset="2004616">We tried to address it and we have raised it and for the first time I have someone who is listening to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.807" offset="2038575">If the United States did act under the Constitution, it did have this power to set the boundary, then the decision of this Court should rest upon the holding to that effect, that it was pursuant to a constitutional power and not upon acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.248" offset="2096358">Because we can't acquiesce and avoid an Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.467" offset="2129272">And this Court on several occasions has held that the State cannot confer on the United States a absent power.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.528" offset="2181517">Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland said "These powers (of the United States) are not given by the people of a single State.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.718" offset="2218193">They are given by the people of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.394" offset="2228955">Consequently, the people of a single State cannot confer a sovereignty which will extend over (the people of the United States)because it is the usurpation of a power which the people of a single State cannot give."</text>
            <text syncTime="545.396" offset="2284962">And Nevada cannot by acquiescence, silent submission, constitutionalize the usurpation of a power.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.075" offset="2319653">Another case, Pennsylvania v. Wheeling Bridge, there was question whether a compact between two States and which Congress had consented to could offer a restriction upon the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.394" offset="2380988">The Court said, clearly not.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.534" offset="2389556">Otherwise Congress and two States would possess the power to modify and alter the Constitution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.122" offset="2415888">There are three other decisions of this Court, Morley v. First Municipality, Coyle v. Smith and Pollard v. Hagan that all said the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.792" offset="2530513">Clearly then, since a state cannot directly -- as these decisions say -- cannot directly alter the Constitution, how could Nevada ever do it by -- indirectly by acquiescence?</text>

            <text syncTime="836.419" offset="3449083">I would submit that the Constitution is not an equitable document.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.416" offset="3460995">It is a legal document setting forth relations of the States between each other, or among each other, among the States vis-a-vis the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.159" offset="3495999">And those legal constitutional relationship cannot be changed by the application of equitable doctrine normally applied between two private citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.267" offset="3536436">I would like now to talk about the joint State survey, the Houghton-Ives Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.862" offset="3558797">California by statute prescribed that they would use in this joint survey two terminal points set by Lt. J. C. Ives, not to be confused with Butler Ives.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.616" offset="3605817">These points were established at the Colorado River and the 35th Parallel and at Lake Tahoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.781" offset="3626506">And they prescribed that these would be used and they were set by the United States Boundary Commission in 1861.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.643" offset="3649912">So two years later the survey is run.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.169" offset="3660048">It is a complete survey of the 120th Meridian and it was surveyed along the lake boundary for about 102 miles and the following year California appropriated money to put a permanent marker at terminal point so as "to enable the survey to be continued from that point at some future time."</text>
            <text syncTime="910.370" offset="3744893">That monument was put up.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.831" offset="3754715">The following year, in 1875, Lawson, who also participated in the other survey, Lawson extended the survey another 73 miles, acting as a joint commissioner for both States.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.414" offset="3805080">So you have to remember at that time the Nevada boundary with California only went as far as the 37th Parallel, it did not go to the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.349" offset="3840815">So that joint boundary was surveyed within a few miles of the 37th Parallel by Lawson's terminal monument.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.908" offset="3871013">So the States when they accepted it, they said, we accept that survey, it is the official boundary so far as it has been run.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.395" offset="3901001">So they knew it was incomplete.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.784" offset="3906539">It hadn't been run all the way to the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.143" offset="3915943">They accepted it the way it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.381" offset="3924929">And incomplete surveys are not unusual at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.317" offset="3936632">The United States Government has surveyed many a State boundary by piecemeal surveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.683" offset="3958053">Probably the longest one is the Majors Darling-Preston Line by three different surveyors on the 37th Parallel between New Mexico Territory and Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.209" offset="3996191">So it is not unusual to do it in piecemeal fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.387" offset="4008939">And General Houghton, who was California's commissioner of the joint survey, reported to the legislature that, we have marked on the Oblique boundary the important part to be marked at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.870" offset="4046869">I don't think there were any settlements along there.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.447" offset="4061184">At this time it was within the power of the United States to have gone out there at that terminal monument, close the public land surveys, and extend Lawson's terminal monument on to the Colorado River, fill in that gap.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.948" offset="7459192">His second point was that congressional approval can be inferred as well as expressly given in cases in which the States have reach an implied agreement or in which they have acquiesced upon a boundary for a long period of years, and that this was a separate and independent ground equally supportive of the position that there was an acquiesced boundary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.606" offset="11357811">California was the plaintiff in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.195" offset="11368155">In your original complaint did you ask the Master to declare the Von Schmidt line the correct line, or the 120th Meridian the correct line?</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.026" offset="11407444">We asked that the Von Schmidt line be declared to be the accurate one, Your Honor, it was basically in the nature of a quiet title as has been suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.667" offset="11446000">When alternative lines were suggested by Nevada, we felt it necessary to request an alternative survey of our own because if the entire location of the line was to be questioned to such extent, we felt that an accurate survey should be thrown in as an alternative to quieting, in effect, the present line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.592" offset="11565746">The Oblique boundary of course we have referred to surveyed somewhat later than the north-south boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.642" offset="11589987">It was surveyed from 1893 to 1899 by the Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.633" offset="11617886">And it replaced the Von Schmidt Line which is the only line that entirely surveyed the Oblique boundary from Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.282" offset="11652472">Once again, we feel that this is clearly an accepted and an acquiesced boundary and the evidence is exactly the same with respect to its acceptance by the States, with two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.557" offset="11697612">One, the period of acquiescence is somewhat shorter, it is 80 years rather than 108 years as it is in the north.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.167" offset="11724048">And the second thing in that this line was recognized not only in fact but in statute by both the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.056" offset="11751633">Both States passed in 1901 and 1903 statutes expressly recognizing the fact the Coast &amp; Geodetic line delineated their boundaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="2944.276" offset="11880469">Now, in the Oblique boundary, just by way of passing, Nevada gained 256 square miles but California nevertheless recognized that boundary initially and we feel it deserves equal recognition in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.944" offset="11955179">We have indicated that we feel there is clearly authority for a new survey if it is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.232" offset="11976286">And Oklahoma v. Texas represents good authority to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.490" offset="11993318">In that case the line proposed by Texas had been rejected on the grounds that it wasn't properly authorized; the line proposed by Oklahoma was rejected on the grounds evidence of acquiescence was insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.719" offset="12042219">And the Court felt that the proper remedy in that case was to direct a new survey to be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.884" offset="13046888">There is precedent of course for such a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.489" offset="13065279">In the last case, Oklahoma v. Louisiana, which this Special Master presided over the question to possible Unites States title to an island, an island named Sam, the State line river as I recall, came up in the course of the proceedings and it was determined that a further determination was necessary to resolve the entire border controversy to ascertain what U.S. interests may be in that island.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.689" offset="13174157">Florida v. Georgia of course is the best and most apropos precedent for such a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.715" offset="13202265">In that case the United States Attorney General actively applied for leave to intervene in a boundary dispute between two States on the basis that millions of acres had been alienated by the United States in what it then believed to be Florida but Georgia was contending to be Georgia and that therefore the United States had a real interest to its grantees in participating in the proceeding and helping to assist the Court in ascertaining the propriety both of the boundary and the consequences of that boundary determination, the status of lands within the affected States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.010" offset="13371434">It was the duty to see the case was fully and well briefed, he argued, and the United States had a general interest in State boundaries because of political considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.941" offset="13407169">Well, in that case Justice Tawney granted leave for the United States to intervene informally, as it was characterized at that time, and to present evidence and to participate but not to be granted leave as a formal party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.979" offset="13463280">And perhaps this resembles what the Special Master has recommended in this case, that the United States offer to participate with Nevada and California to help clear up this last remaining question which has been caused by these old boundaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="3377.767" offset="13614477">They have deferred presentation of their views and simply asked to be given an opportunity to participate informally until resolution can be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.859" offset="13682813">Basically, then, our position has been that the boundary question is one which is capable of easy resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.553" offset="13713533">It does not represent a case of the unconstitutional transfer of a boundary from one jurisdiction to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.468" offset="13753240">Rather, it involves the location of a boundary in the ground which was accepted immediately by both States and has been relied upon by the residents of those States for over 100 years in one case and for 80 years in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.212" offset="13808201">The cases we think clearly support the Special Master's recommendation in that case that the boundary be settled where it has been and where we relied upon it.</text>
