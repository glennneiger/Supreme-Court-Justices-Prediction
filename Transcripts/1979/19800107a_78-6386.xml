            <text syncTime="23.735" offset="199325">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.976" offset="212281">My name is Scott Atlas, court appointed counsel for the petitioner, William James Rummel.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.552" offset="238613">The only issue before this Court is whether the Texas habitual offender statute, which since 1856 has mandated an automatic life sentence upon third felony conviction, is cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution as applied to the three offenses for which my client received his life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.356" offset="329832">The facts are simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.816" offset="339655">In 1964, at the age of 21, Rummel pleaded guilty to buying four tires at a gas station, worth $80, with a credit card that wasn't his.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.177" offset="385108">In 1969, he pleaded guilty to forging a $28.36 check to pay rent at a hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.090" offset="420739">And in 1972, he accepted a $120.75 check and promised to fix an air-conditioner, didn't do it and in 1973 a jury convicted him in essence of not intending to do it when he accepted the check.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.369" offset="493881">In the state trial court, after the conviction, the jury found that he had committed the two prior felonies and the judge assessed him the automatic life sentence required under Texas law.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.161" offset="661065">So you are casting your entire case on the nature of the offense which the State of Texas through its legislature has declared to be a felony?</text>

            <label>Mr. Scott J. Atlas</label>
            <text syncTime="150.759" offset="707459">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.783" offset="711534">Each of the three offenses were felonies at the time they were committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.469" offset="726267">The third felony, the $120 check offense became a misdemeanor eight months later, punishable by a maximum of only one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.587" offset="758763">But at the time it was committed -- in fact, I think that is also true with the first offense, the credit card offense -- at the time each of the three offenses were committed, they were felonies under Texas law and there is no question whatsoever that the statute was properly applied according to the dictates of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.714" offset="823233">I take it, too, that -- well, I will put it to you as a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.485" offset="838384">Suppose in each of these cases you had exactly the same amount involved, that it was the theft of a welfare check going to a welfare recipient, what would be your position?</text>

            <label>Mr. Scott J. Atlas</label>
            <text syncTime="195.223" offset="885300">Your Honor, that is clearly the most difficult analytical problem in this case, and my answer is not a perfect one.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.694" offset="907139">I think I would still be here arguing in this Court that the harm to the victims, since it is normally irrelevant at the sentencing stage unless it forms part of the substantive offense, is also irrelevant at the conviction stage that it ought not to be a factor for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.188" offset="965130">Nonetheless, I realize that that created by far the most difficult analytical problem, but I think that since stealing the $200 or whatever the amount would be from a welfare victim presumably constitutes the same offense under Texas law, regardless of the identity of the victim, we would argue that the offenses would make no difference in this Court's analysis.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="236.605" offset="1050812">And if these were street robberies, at the point of a gun, in exactly the same amounts, what would be your position?</text>

            <text syncTime="242.848" offset="1075785">Your Honor, my position would be very different and I would not be before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.743" offset="1091354">We have argued in our briefs and we contend to this Court that if there was any element of violence or potential violence in any one of the three offenses, that this Court ought not to consider the issue because the State of Texas is entitled to pass judgment of a life sentence, even automatic, on anyone convicted of an offense that involves a violent offense such as the bank robberies or street robberies that you mentioned, regardless of whether any money was taken successfully or not.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="274.574" offset="1202740">Where in the Constitution or cases of this Court do you find the distinction between money taken by violence or crimes committed accompanied by violence and perhaps very significant white collar fraud that didn't involve a bit of violence?</text>

            <label>Mr. Scott J. Atlas</label>
            <text syncTime="292.959" offset="1276197">Your Honor, first let me clarify my point a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.253" offset="1289362">When I say that if the offenses, any one of them are violent, that that ought to mean the case should not be in this Court, I do not mean that those are the only circumstances under which the Court ought not to consider an Eighth Amendment claim given a mandatory life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.967" offset="1344219">There are certain offenses I think in addition to violent offenses -- for example, drug crimes, and certain other crimes where the state has a peculiarly strong interest -- nonetheless, in direct answer to your question, there is nothing specifically written in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.216" offset="1405241">We would argue that the Eighth Amendment ought to apply to a lengthy sentence under certain circumstances and in attempting to develop some type of objective criteria we have relied on the Court's decisions and the rules prescribed in various death penalty and non-death penalty cases, in particular the Court's 1977 Coker decision which talked about the disproportionate nature of offenses to the punishment given, and we would argue that in looking at the nature of the offenses that any time an offense involves violence or some element of violence or threat off violence, that since those kinds of offenses are always punished much more seriously in every state in this country, then the kind of nonviolent petty property crimes with which this Court is dealing in this case, that that ought to be some indication, although not the final answer, in and of itself that the sentence is excessive.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.519" offset="2298420">Texas is the only state now as a practical matter where one would receive an automatic life sentence for these three felonies, and we would argue that since one of the criteria outlined by this Court in the 1977 Coker case and then mentioned at various times by other members of this Court in other decisions, is looking at not only the nature of the offenses but the trend in other states and the manner in which other states punish the same offenses, but since we have been able to trace out for this Court every habitual offender statute ever enacted in this country in the last 200 years, and since it is clear that a number of other states, perhaps 17 I believe have attempted to punish prisoners with an automatic life sentence upon a certain number of nonviolent felony convictions, and every one of those states, one after another over the course of the years has decided that either the statute didn't work or it was unfair and now Texas stands alone by itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.296" offset="2885548">But where someone receives a life sentence under Texas law, the time for release is never, and parole in Texas is something, as this Court has held in the Greenholtz case last term, is something completely within the discretion of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.709" offset="2943227">As I have indicated in the reply brief, the Governor of Texas recently has been taking a much more strict interpretation of the parole provisions and in fact in June of this year rejected 79 percent of the parole board's recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.013" offset="3000487">The state has argued that the life sentence here is not really a life sentence because the parole board -- because Mr. Rummel might get good time credit and move up the time when he is eligible for parole consideration, because then the parole board might then choose to recommend parole to the Governor, and that the Governor might then decide to exercise his prerogative to grant the parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.772" offset="3095468">These are conditions under which Mr. Rummel has absolutely no right and ought not to be considered by this Court because if Mr. Rummel does not receive his hearing here today he will never receive it, this Court will never review his parole determination, if it is denied forever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1088.905" offset="4460001">On the one hand, we do not argue that the state is not entitled to increase the punishment based on the existence of prior offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1099.148" offset="4500961">On the other hand, if the statute mandated a life sentence upon third or fourth or fifth parking ticket, we have no doubt that the Court would find that statute grossly excessive, that punishment grossly excessive considering the nature of the offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.125" offset="4560938">Well, having established the principle at some point, we are now really attempting to determine where the line ought to be drawn, not whether, because under some circumstances if the state legislature is entitled to characterize something as criminal and entitled to punish the third offense, the third commission of that offense with a life sentence, then a parking offense which states typically characterize as criminal, whether felony or misdemeanor, would justify a life sentence under that rationale upon the third commission of it, and there is no question that someone who committed a third parking ticket or a third speeding ticket or in Texas the third time you steal a goat, with an automatic life sentence, at some point this Court will be called in to say that the legislature has exceeded constitutional bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.388" offset="4749960">And we would argue that in attempting to provide some type of objective criteria for this Court to decide the case and attempting to suggest some ways to limit the inherent subjectivity that is involved in most constitutional decisions and even most peculiarly in an Eighth Amendment decision, that the criteria that have been outlined by the Court and that we have attempted to demonstrate we fulfill, and frankly whatever test this Court chooses to adopt for evaluating sentence length, we think Mr. Rummel's case makes it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1298.259" offset="5297382">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.778" offset="5311488">I am Douglas Becker, Assistant Attorney General of the State of Texas, attorney for the State of Texas in this habeas corpus matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.309" offset="5345656">Your Honors, the State of Texas is of the opinion that the fundamental issue in this case is one of federalism, a question of -- questions of federalism have often appeared before the Court in years past, but we feel that rarely has a case ever cried out for judicial restraint and the application of a doctrine that is attractive at first glance to some because of the seeming oppressive nature of Mr. Rummel's sentence in light of his convictions, but which would have effects upon the administration of justice in Texas and indeed throughout the nation, that would make the costs of such a system far outweigh any supposed benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.828" offset="5519736">Now, we feel that in the first place the holding contended for by Mr. Rummel in this case would be a usurpation of traditional prosecutorial discretion in authority that has prevailed in this country and indeed in England and which prevails today in virtually all the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.390" offset="5589953">The prosecutors in Texas who are locally elected, as is often the case across this nation, it had always been thought had the right to rely upon the judgment of their own state legislature insofar as a societal judgment in that particular society in Texas as opposed to any other state as to which crimes were more serious than other crimes, as to which crimes should be punished more severely than other crimes, as to whether certain offenses which were also offenses in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island should be punished more or less severely in Texas in light of unique Texas experience, and that in the context of this case insofar as habitual offenders are concerned, those who are unable to conform their conduct to the norms of civilized society, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist phrased it a moment ago, the manner in which those persons should be punished and as to what attempts at rehabilitation should be made for those persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.078" offset="5836758">We thought that the District Attorney should rely upon the judgment of the legislature, that he would in exercising his discretion when he felt the statute should be invoked, that he might do so, subject to the review of the grand jury in Texas, and that such a sentence might be imposed on someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.323" offset="5909692">Now, seen in this light, the application of the statute is not automatic, as Mr. Rummel says it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.255" offset="5937382">Instead, the legislature gives the local prosecutor the discretion whether or not to apply or to seek the invocation of that statute on a particular offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.897" offset="5983984">He commonly and frequently for many reasons elects not to apply it even thought he might.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.437" offset="6006136">This is well known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.968" offset="6012301">And in such a case, even then he must persuade the grand jury that this is a proper case for the application of the habitual offender statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.867" offset="11283916">Now, of course, we say that remedial measures are peculiarly province of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.082" offset="11308680">Now, in the Spencer case in 1967, when it was before this Court, as the Court knows, by the time that the case got to this Court the Texas legislature had already enacted a statute that had done away with the single proceeding that was a problem in the case and had instituted the bifurcated proceeding where the jury would not be told until the sentencing phase of trial about any prior convictions that the defendant had, so remedial legislation had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.910" offset="11420066">I am aware of remedial legislation in this case, but it is not relevant, of course, to the outcome here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.313" offset="11441695">It may exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.073" offset="11444726">It is being undertaken by those persons that we feel are the proper ones to diagnose the problem and if there are some results that are impermissible or even if the results are generally all right but, as Mr. Justice Stewart has suggested, that better guidelines should be instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.446" offset="11510136">Perhaps the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals should review sentence length, as some courts do in some systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.707" offset="11531243">There are a lot of systems that perhaps might be better and we don't debate and don't feel that it is our burden to show that ours is the wisest system among all the states, but only that is permissible under the Constitution and that this Court is not the proper forum for correcting every apparent inequity in the sentencing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.581" offset="11606685">Now, there is one other -- the Court knows that there is an alternate prayer for relief at the conclusion of our brief, and just before I close I would like to emphasize it, and that is that if the Court is not convinced that there is a facial inequity in this case, if it appears under the Court's view that the sentence is grossly disproportionate for what has been shown -- we point out to the Court that there never has been a hearing in this case in either state or federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.261" offset="11729460">Now, Judge Borman, dissenting in Hart v. Coiner, the famous Fourth Circuit case that preceded this one, stated that it should not be beyond the ordinary knowledge of judges who had been prosecutors and other kinds of attorneys before they were judges that the habitual offender statute is rarely enacted for a person who only has the offenses that is necessary to formally allege and prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.919" offset="11816082">Now, if there is any doubt at all about the existence of that fact in this case, we pray for a remand to the District Court where we are entitled we believe to show the full extent of Mr. Rummel's criminal history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.859" offset="11867805">We cannot believe that if it were shown that he had committed sufficient offenses to show to the agreement of everyone that he is a career criminal in an ordinary understanding of that word, that we would not be entitled to embark upon a course of conduct that we have undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.341" offset="11937708">There was in this case no objection at his trial to the punishment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.192" offset="11957144">If there had been, the record might well be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.687" offset="11967175">If Mr. Rummel's attorney had stood up and said we think life for these crimes is too much, the prosecutor might well at that point have stood up and said, very well, Your Honor, we would like to hear the rest of it, we will be glad to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.563" offset="12006672">We didn't have that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.237" offset="12013359">In the Federal District Court below, we made a motion to dismiss along with our answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.130" offset="12032899">Under the case law that is all we needed to do, we felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.396" offset="12041989">Ultimately we were proved correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.180" offset="12049095">In essence, we think it is quite similar to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.528" offset="12066544">If the case is going to go off on proportionality to the benefit of Mr. Rummel, the state would pray that it go off upon the fall basis that we have a full opportunity to show exactly his history and his circumstances.</text>
