            <label>Ms. Elinor Hadley Stillman</label>
            <text syncTime="48.386" offset="296939">Thank you, your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.369" offset="304880">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.848" offset="318777">This case is here on the government's petition for review of a decision of the Third Circuit construing 28 U.S.C. 2401(b), the statute of limitations provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.037" offset="371545">Under that provision, a tort claim against the United States is barred if it is not presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after the claim accrues.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.835" offset="418670">The question in this case is whether a claim for medical malpractice under the act accrues when the claimant knows both the existence and the cause of his injury even if he does not know that the injury amounted to medical negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.945" offset="479169">The facts are not here in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.230" offset="488260">The respondent entered a V.A. hospital in April 1968 and was treated for an infection of the femur of his right leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.365" offset="516786">Treatment consisted of a deep surgical incision followed by treatment by drugs, including irrigation of the wound with a solution of neomycin sulfate for about 13 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.274" offset="564433">In June, the respondent noticed a ringing in his ears and some loss of hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.804" offset="582614">An ear specialist whom he consulted in August diagnosed his condition as bilateral nerve deafness.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.047" offset="607587">Another ear specialist, Dr. Joseph Sataloff, whom he visited in November, wrote for his VA records and discovered that he had been treated with neomycin.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.248" offset="648338">In January 1969, Dr. Sataloff told the respondent that it was highly possible or words to that effect that the neomycin treatment had caused his deafness.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.334" offset="688671">In April 1969, the respondent who had been receiving VA disability benefits for a back injury filed a claim seeking increased benefits for the injury to his hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.474" offset="737259">He asserted in this claim that his deafness resulted from medication given him by the VA and he cited Dr. Sataloff's opinion as the basis for this assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.901" offset="778951">A VA board of physicians denied the claim, stating among other things that the treatment -- that the deafness was not caused by the neomycin treatment and that the treatment was not negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.998" offset="823359">The respondent vigorously disputed this denial of causation over the next several years, writing letters and claims and explaining why it was caused by neomycin in the course of appeal and remand proceedings before the VA respecting the disability benefits claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.102" offset="887829">In May 1971, while those proceedings were going on, the VA sent him a report, a supplemental statement of the case that included a report by a VA investigator and this report stated that one of the doctors whom respondent had consulted had said that his deafness might be attributable to his previous occupation as a machinist.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.540" offset="969540">The respondent confronted the doctor who had allegedly made this statement, Dr. Soma, and Dr. Soma denied the statement attributed to him and told the respondent that neomycin had caused his deafness and that the VA doctors should not have given him that drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.607" offset="1033801">The Court of Appeals, affirming the District Court, held that the respondent's tort claim accrued for the first time at this time, June 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.543" offset="1073507">So his written statement of claim filed in January 1973 was timely under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.348" offset="1096808">The court's holding is predicated on the view that a malpractice claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act does not accrue until a claimant knows or should know causation, damages, existence of a duty of care and breach of the duty of care.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.807" offset="1458552">But during the time that he was litigating this question before the VA, there was no suggestion that the VA was sitting on secret knowledge that in fact --</text>

            <text syncTime="348.242" offset="1496377">They were not hiding anything from him.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.336" offset="1504737">I don't believe there is any claim of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.666" offset="1518007">There are complaints that they didn't send complete records to Dr. Sataloff, they only send a letter saying -- but there is no real claim here about concealment or fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.110" offset="1567848">Our basic contention in this case is a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.415" offset="1581014">When a person knows that he has been injured and that his injury has been caused by a particular course of medical treatment, he is on notice to commence inquiries into the possibility that the treatment may have been negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.343" offset="1628766">The limitations period in a statute of limitations is the time set aside for making such inquiries and for filing suit if answers to the inquiries reveal the basis for legal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.847" offset="1674742">In the case of the Federal Tort Claims Act, of course, you don't have to file your lawsuit within the two years, you file merely a written statement of claim with the federal agency, including a statement of the amount certain in damages that you are seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.677" offset="1726046">When the statute of limitations operates to bar an apparently meritorious claim, the result will often strike a court and certainly a plaintiff as harsh, but there are nonetheless sound and long recognized policy reasons supporting such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.187" offset="1788113">Our review of the legislative history of the Federal Tort Claims Act statute of limitations indicates that Congress enacted and has retained the provision at issue here because it accepts the soundness of those reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.955" offset="1835238">Statutes of limitations exist because it is the judgment of legislatures that litigation of stale claims is undesirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.324" offset="1868675">With the passage of time, reliable relevant evidence may disappear and it is thought unjust to subject an individual suit on even a possibly meritorious claim many years after the incident giving rise to it, when he is likely to find it difficult to collect evidence for his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.142" offset="1939937">By barring even meritorious claims after an arbitrary period of time, the statute of limitations induces persons with possible legal claims to investigate and litigate them promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.780" offset="1986539">One cannot expect a person to commence an investigation, however, until he knows of something to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.191" offset="2012139">That is the reason that this Court in Urie v. Thompson held that the action of the railroad worker against his employer under the Federal Employer's Liability Act was not barred when he sued within the prescribed limitations period as measured from the time he first discovered that he had silicosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.148" offset="2079953">It was not measured from the date many years before in the early symptomless stages as his disease began.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.066" offset="2107643">Not until he knew he had the disease could he begin asking whether it could have been avoided by differently designed or maintained railroad equipment and whether the railroads had a duty to provide such equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.265" offset="2160410">To hold that the statute had run before he was on notice to make such inquiries would penalize the worker for what is called blameless ignorance because he could not know what was inherently unknowable, the harm that was inherently unknowable.</text>

            <label>Ms. Elinor Hadley Stillman</label>
            <text syncTime="1008.541" offset="4137566">Your Honor, for that reason we say the statute did not start to run until the following January.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.693" offset="4162121">We are not arguing that the statute started to run when he was in the hospital or even when he first noticed deafness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.670" offset="4198066">We think that the rule that this Court applies in Urie and which was taken over by the Fifth Circuit in the Quinton case is a basically reasonable rule if it is interpreted with the limits which we understand it to have, because we think it is reasonable that one would not be on notice to investigate possible negligence until he knows he has been injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.675" offset="4314049">We submit that the construction given the statute by the Court of Appeals, however, would be wrong as to any statute of limitations that lacks a tolling provision to permit the kind of delay which the Court of Appeals would permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.234" offset="4364309">And where the limitations provision is in this suit, a condition on a waiver of sovereign immunity and hence a provision to be strictly construed, we think that the construction is clearly impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.952" offset="4423137">The courts below, I have noted, suggested that the rule was quite narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.864" offset="4442781">They said that it was technically complex and that would be one reason for limiting the rule here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.908" offset="4463052">They also said that because the VA denied causation and negligence, this was a reason for saying that he would not be on notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.589" offset="4501713">The denial of negligence, of course, is irrelevant where there is a finding by the court that he knew -- the denial of a finding of causation is irrelevant where there is a finding by the court that he knew that the neomycin had caused his deafness and, as I say, the Court of Appeals' rule is predicated on that understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.819" offset="4582693">And as to the denial of liability, we would say that in technically complex cases of the sort posited by the Court of Appeals here, a denial of liability by someone who is confronted with someone demanding damages for his injury is to be expected and not an excuse for ceasing any investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.452" offset="4661164">We will concede, of course, that the court made no finding, although the plaintiff was not deterred by their denials of causation he was somehow deterred by their conclusory denials of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.247" offset="4716335">Finally, the courts below relied on the fact that none of the physicians that he consulted ever spontaneously advised him that neomycin treatment was medically negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.706" offset="4758235">This, however, is not logically a factor supporting the conclusion that the respondent did not and could not in the exercise of reasonable diligence have known that the neomycin treatment was negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.422" offset="4801076">It is itself a legal conclusion that the respondent had no duty to ask physicians or lawyers about the possibility of negligence once he knew his deafness had been caused by neomycin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.649" offset="4846007">The Court of Appeals is simply using the conclusion in support of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.899" offset="4867009">The respondent begs the question in a similar manner when he argues in his brief at pages 14 and 15 that what he terms a conspiracy of silence among physicians and difficulties in obtaining access to medical records make it unreasonable to hold that a layman is on notice of possible negligence when he knows only that a course of medical treatment has harmed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.919" offset="4955094">If as we submit the limitation period begins running at the time the claimant gains knowledge of the nexus in treatment and injury, it is irrelevant whether physicians are unduly reluctant to accuse each other of malpractice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.716" offset="5006190">The respondent's complaint is more logically understood as a contention that problems in obtaining medical testimony and in gaining access to records make the investigation of medical negligence a long and difficult task with the result that a proper claim cannot be prepared in the time allotted by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.276" offset="5076511">But the remedy for this problem, if the problem exists, is not to devise a rule that relieves the claimant of any duty to inquire into possible negligence but to extend the limitations periods under the Tort Claims Act and a remedy such as that, of course, may only be governed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.572" offset="5145684">In sum, we have a statute of limitations under the Federal Tort Claims Act, a provision that must be construed strictly because it is a condition on the waiver of the government's immunity to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.884" offset="5190928">At the very least, strict construction demands avoiding constructions that undermine the basic policies of the provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.546" offset="5217573">By holding that persons who know or should know that they have been injured by government medical treatment may postpone the operation of the limitations provision of the act simply by failing to inquire of anyone whether treatment may have been negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.337" offset="5272743">The Court of Appeals has underline the policy of encouraging prompt investigation of claims which lies at the heart of any statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.194" offset="5304195">We submit that however many Court of Appeals may have been drawn into reciting the rule which the court below has adopted, that they are wrong and that this Court sits to correct such errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.954" offset="5375143">Accordingly, we submit that the rule was erroneous, that under a proper construction of the provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act, the respondent's claim was clearly barred and we ask the judgment of the Court of Appeals to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.775" offset="5430523">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.617" offset="12021844">Also as to the VA standard which he says is negligence, I simply would refer the Court to the VA regulations and that regulation is printed at page 4, Footnote 2 of our brief, and it refers to -- it says compensation is not payable for either the usual or the unusual after-results of approved medical care properly administered, in the absence of a showing that the disability approximately resulted through carelessness, accident, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment or similar incidences of indicated fault on the part of the Veterans Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.634" offset="12201880">And obviously this is a different standard from an error in judgment which you had a duty of care to avoid at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.947" offset="12231137">So it is a fault standard but it is not the medical malpractice standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.694" offset="12254124">Finally, I simply would observe that the respondent's explanation of how the rule would work, how accrual would be determined under his test would simply leave us with no rule at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.120" offset="12303862">There is really no point in having a fixed time if it is going to be some kind of balancing test where you consider the state of mind and the state of education of the plaintiff and whether the government was prejudiced, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.337" offset="12360704">We would agree with Mr. Justice Rehnquist that if Congress had intended any such test they simply would have said apply the doctrine of Latches and they clearly have not done that here.</text>
