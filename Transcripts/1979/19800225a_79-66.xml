            <label>Mr. Barry M. Fallick</label>
            <text syncTime="61.572" offset="349706">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.554" offset="361618">This matter concerns an appeal from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which affirmed a judgment of the District Court which had permanently enjoined the petitioner from violating the anti-fraud provisions and the registration provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.246" offset="440404">The issue that is raised in this appeal is whether scienter is a necessary element in an action for injunctive relief under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and under Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.175" offset="504038">The facts surrounding the issuance of the permanent injunction are quite short and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.488" offset="529324">Petitioner was employed by a company known as E. L. Aaron &amp; Company, a company owned by his father.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.950" offset="559208">From 1974 through the beginning of 1975, E. L. Aaron &amp; Company was making a market in the common stock of a company known as Lawn-A-Mat Chemical &amp; Equipment Corp. During that period of time, a branch office was opened in Roslyn Heights, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.835" offset="630680">Two registered employees of E. L. Aaron &amp; Company sent to that branch office and during their time there they made misrepresentations concerning the financial status and health of Lawn-A-Mat and also concerning future manufacturing ideas concerning Lawn-A-Mat.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.543" offset="709569">The District Court, while finding that Mr. Aaron did not make any false misrepresentations, nevertheless said he willfully aided and abetted a violation of the anti-fraud provisions by failing to prevent him employees from continuing in those statements they made. Of course, Mr. Aaron was not an owner of E. L. Aaron &amp; Company, nor was he an officer of E. L. Aaron &amp; Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.565" offset="837674">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals nevertheless said that it did not have to reach the issue of scienta and based on its long-term policy said that the standard in injunctive actions under section 10(b) would be a negligence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.246" offset="900368">Thus, the first issue was whether under section 10(b) there should be a standard of scienter in injunctive actions.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="205.222" offset="924296">Mr. Fallick, in your question presented for decision in your petition for certiorari, when you refer to the government enforcement by injunction of these acts, do you think there is fairly assumed the federal rules of civil procedure, 65 et cetera, relating to injunctions, regardless of whether the particular statutes contain a requirement of scienter or not when enforcement is brought by the government?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barry_m_fallick" startTime="235.952" stopTime="473.377">
            <label>Mr. Barry M. Fallick</label>
            <text syncTime="235.952" offset="1047176">Well, standards under the sections concerning injunctive relief, whether the defendant is engaged or likely to engage in a violation of certain sections or regulations of the securities law, and I am not quite sure if that is the same standard under the federal 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.835" offset="1126693">In the Hochfelder case, this Court had the opportunity to construe the meaning of section 10(b) in the context of a private damage action.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.904" offset="1170996">We submit that there is nothing in that Court's decision which indicates that a different standard should be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.442" offset="1201089">In Hochfelder, this Court relied on the language, legislative history and administrative history of section 10(b) to determine that that language connotes intentional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.960" offset="1255215">Of course, when section 10(b) was enacted, Congress did not contemplate that there would be a private damage cause of action, therefore the language and the history should reflect congressional determination and intention concerning injunctive relief under section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="306.101" offset="1327731">The government relies heavily on the Capital Gains case in which this Court in 1940 stated that there is a difference between fraud in law and fraud in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.099" offset="1379767">In that case, Capital Gains, Mr. Justice Goldberg heavily relied upon the legislative history surrounding the Investment Advisers Act, and this Court has said that that interpretation is premised on congressional belief that there should be standards concerning federal fiduciary relationship with investment advisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.503" offset="1489377">In addition, Mr. Justice Goldberg was clearly influenced by the fact that the injunctive relief in Capital Gains was mildly propylactic.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.717" offset="1530232">Here, however, in the normal course of security business, injunctive relief is no longer considered mildly prophylactic.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.190" offset="1564087">There is a loss of reputation, a loss of business, subject to administrative and criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.846" offset="1594807">Courts no longer, especially in the Second Circuit, consider injunctive relief to be mildly propylactic.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.427" offset="1625109">Thus, because the statutory text of Capital Gains is of course different than under 10(b), because of the legislative history of the Investment Advisers Act, and because of the premise that injunctive relief is mildly propylactic, and it was in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.903" offset="1686967">That case was clearly distinguishable from the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.598" offset="1709746">There is also an issue presented here concerning whether injunctive relief should be premised on a standard of scienter under section 17(a) of the 1933 Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.950" offset="1759169">Several courts, several commentators have recently commented upon section 17(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="420.771" offset="1786441">The Fifth Circuit, in construing subsection (1) of 17(a), said the language there, especially the words "device, scheme and artifice to defraud" clearly connote that Congress intended that a standard of scienter be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.835" offset="1850702">Of course, the Fifth Circuit in the Steadman case was relying on the language of this Court in Hochfelder.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.920" offset="1883094">The petitioner takes the position that whatever standard, especially it should be a scienter standard, is established under 10(b), it should also govern under section 17(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="455.791" offset="1926562">These two sections are so closely related, they both serve the same function, that it is clear that congressional intent should be that the language should be construed to establish that the standard of liability for injunctive relief under 10(b) is a scienter standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.226" offset="2688293">Under section 10(b), the section that I began with, the commission would submit that a deceptive act may be enjoined by a federal District Court judge if he finds that it is likely to recur.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.841" offset="2750777">The fact that somebody has engaged in the past in a deceptive act is for purposes of a commission action not significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.920" offset="2791006">Remember, the commission's injunctive action under section 10(b) is predicated upon a showing that a defendant is engaged or is about to engage in a violation of any of the sections of the Exchange Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="776.334" offset="3208756">That is a much different legal context than when the commission brings an action for injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.046" offset="3231535">In that context, the word "deception" -- not deceive, recall section 10(b) does not prescribe deceit, it prescribes deceptive practices or deceptive devices -- in that legal context, we think the language of section 10(b) takes on a shade of different meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.784" offset="3310529">And I might add, Mr. Justice Stewart, there is nothing strange to the law and the canons of statutory construction, this Court has found that to be the case before.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.693" offset="3354102">SEC v. National Securities, for example, comes to mind, an opinion in which, as I recall it, you concurred in part and dissented in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.164" offset="3388061">In that opinion, writing for the majority of the Court, Mr. Justice Marshall commented that the word "sale" could take on different meanings in the context of the registration provisions and the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.578" offset="3449710">In doing that, Mr. Justice Marshall noted that even Congress had intended in the definitional sections of the Securities Act that the words listed in there should have the meaning stated unless the context otherwise required.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.009" offset="3503417">And if my recollection serves me correct, you dissented in part from that portion of Mr. Justice Marshall's opinion, writing, for the majority, but even in that dissenting footnote I think you said while definitional problems are reasonably related in private actions and in SEC enforcement actions, it is not plainly inconsistent to give different shades of meaning because of the different context within which those two actions arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.068" offset="3615640">So the position that the commission is taking here is consistent with principles of statutory construction I think that this Court has utilized in prior cases generally and in prior securities cases specifically.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph C. Ferrara</label>
            <text syncTime="1321.218" offset="5388204">Well, the government at that point would have two options to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.605" offset="5401788">One, it could seek criminal contempt against the defendant demonstrating that because he has been specifically put on notice by the prior injunction in an admonitory way that his conduct violates the law, that the second time he is engaged willfully or knowingly in a violation of the federal securities laws, contempt will lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.491" offset="5473364">Or the commission alternatively could go back against the same defendant, demonstrating that the perhaps further judicial relief is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.652" offset="5537938">The key I think to the commission's position on this case is not that the commission intends to go out and to willy-nilly issue or ask courts to issue injunctions against people who have done nothing more than fail to exercise due care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.403" offset="5600946">To the contrary, though, the commission's position is, again, once someone -- once a federal District Court judge makes determination that someone has engaged in misconduct which has resulted in a deception and is reasonably likely to recur, that federal District Court judge should not be powerless to enter an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.778" offset="5682448">Now, if the conduct that the commission demonstrates is in fact intentional conduct or scienter, as used in the Hochfelder case, then I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, there is a very high likelihood that the federal District Court judge will enter the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.907" offset="5743052">If, on the other hand, the defendant's conduct was singular and wholly faultless, drawing on a term from the Hochfelder opinion, then it is far less likely that a federal District Court judge would utilize his discretion to enter the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.012" offset="5807417">And in that gray area of what runs between wholly faultless conduct and intentional conduct -- and I suppose there are gradations there of culpability which include gross negligence, recklessness, knowing conduct, scienter, intentional conduct, willful conduct, and so on -- depending on the gradation that the commission demonstrates, I think you increase the likelihood that an injunction will be entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.640" offset="5913893">Again, it is critical to keep in mind that for the commission's case, as opposed to a private action, the substantive provision, 10(b), and the authorization to seek an injunction, 21(d) of the Exchange Act, actually have to merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.356" offset="5984841">Merely proving a past violation doesn't get you there, and that is what distinguishes this case from Hochfelder, and that is the extraordinarily different legal context in which this case is presented, the context that requires that injunctions be issued not be precluded absent a showing of scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.625" offset="6069896">Mr. Justice Blackmun, I think you will note in the comment that I just made perhaps somewhat of a response to a comment you made in your dissenting opinion in Hockfelder, that the action should not depend upon the identity of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.164" offset="6140008">The commission continues to agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.651" offset="6157981">The commission's position here is that the operation of section 10(b) doesn't depend on whether the plaintiff is the commission or a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.772" offset="6190477">The distinction depends upon the nature of the action, the totally different legal context of an equitable action versus an action for money damages, which I might add is consistent with the issue that was reserved in the Hochfelder opinion in Footnote 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.434" offset="6253066">Recall, the majority opinion in Footnote 12 of Hochfelder specifically reserved the question of whether scienter need be shown in an injunctive proceeding under section 10(b) or rule 10(b)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.108" offset="6299773">It didn't reserve the question necessarily of whether an SEC enforcement proceeding need not show scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.762" offset="6334464">It is the quality, the character, the nature of the proceeding that makes the coloration of the words, the interpretation of the words, the statutory construction principles that are applicable different, not the identity of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.080" offset="6395695">Well, if I may, I have covered a good many of the things that I wanted to talk on today, but perhaps I could spend a moment or two detailing some of the other considerations that the commission would like to bring to bear on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.526" offset="6469465">First, picking up and continuing on this thread of the need for the commission to proceed without an absolute showing of scienter in its injunctive actions, I think that to fail to do so would really fail to recognize some very important distinctions that are -- and standards of culpability that are included in other provisions of the Securities and Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.891" offset="6570924">For example, in other governmental proceedings the Congress very carefully chose words of culpability, willfully, reasonable care, good faith, reasonable grounds to believe, purpose, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.141" offset="6631946">Those words we think are peculiarly absent from section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.758" offset="6650441">They are also absent from the provisions that authorized the commission to bring its injunctive proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.225" offset="6668309">That is important, and the reason it is important is because Congress in defining the array of enforcement powers that the commission has used those words of culpability in other specific provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.376" offset="6732884">For example, the commission has various enforcement alternatives available to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.376" offset="6748871">One of those enforcement alternatives is an administrative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.476" offset="6761305">There Congress reached and used a specific word of culpability, willfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.672" offset="6782098">The commission also, working with the Department of Justice, can refer a case for criminal prosecution, another specific remedy provided to the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.159" offset="6816057">There the Congress also chose another very specific word of culpability, willfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.692" offset="6846151">This we don't think was inadvertent, that in the final section of the act -- not the final, but another section of the act, authorizing the commission to seek injunctive relief, the Congress specifically declined to use standards of culpability but, rather, used a different locution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.598" offset="6917726">The Congress chose to say the commission can seek an injunction upon a proper showing, so the Congress moved from words of culpability to burden of proof problems, different concept.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.088" offset="7123675">-- and that context recognized that common law, this very distinct division between actions at fraud at law and actions at fraud and equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.284" offset="7160560">Congress realized that at the time, so that is the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.162" offset="7172054">In that context, the word "manipulative" does take on an actions at law, money damage actions, an intent connotation and an intent character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.341" offset="7224717">In a commission injunctive action at equity, if the effect of the action is manipulative, perhaps the commission should be able to seek an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.122" offset="7263901">Also manipulative, when used in the Exchange Act, is indeed a word of art, as Mr. Justice Powell noted in his majority opinion in Hochfelder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.373" offset="7296815">But that word of art doesn't only cover the wash sales the matched orders, the kinds of manipulation, classic manipulation that I think the Court was referring to in the context of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.524" offset="7353448">The context, again following up with your question, the context is manipulative when you look, for example, at section 9(a)(4) of the Exchange Act, contained in the general manipulative section, also reaches false statements for the purpose of inducing a person to purchase or sale of a security on an exchange, all wrapped within the concept of manipulation, the context within which Congress intended those words to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.187" offset="7452087">When you get around to your other two words, device and contrivance, first there is nothing in those two words themselves that necessarily connote a form of intentional misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.716" offset="7510288">I agree that Webster's -- when you read the Webster definitions of device and contrivance, there is that -- you can read in that element of intent, but I can note for you that in the Exchange Act itself, Congress -- that is your context -- Congress used the words device and contrivance virtually interchangeably with the words acts and practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.844" offset="7602761">If you look, for example, at section 15(c)(1) and 15(c)(2) of the Exchange Act, and more importantly you read the legislative history that accompanies those two sections, and why the Congress wrote section 15(c)(1) and 15(c)(2) the way that they did, I think it is illustrative of the point that those concepts were roughly interchangeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.308" offset="7684577">Also, if you look at the legislative history of section 10(b), again if my recollection is correct, the Senate report, reporting out the bill that ultimately became the Exchange Act as modified by the House bill, I think you will find that the Senate report refers to section 10(b) as prescribing the use of manipulative or deceptive acts and practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.346" offset="7784782">So I don't think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that you can look at the words standing along or in isolation or outside of the context within which they were passed and say that in an equitable proceeding Congress absolutely intended that the commission demonstrate scienter, particularly when in a footnote that runs on for two pages in our brief -- particularly when in that footnote the Congress otherwise used a whole array of culpability words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.318" offset="7892616">It certainly knew how to use them when it wanted to -- a whole array of culpability words, and didn't here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2191.326" offset="8868655">Well, I think had the Second Circuit said that we affirm the District Court's findings of scienter and then said but we're going off on a negligence standard of liability, then I think perhaps the standard the court chose may have been dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.315" offset="8952665">The Court of Appeals did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.652" offset="8957994">The Court of Appeals specifically said we are only reaching the negligence question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.065" offset="8979623">In concluding, I would like to spend just a moment if I may in saying why or explaining why the commission took really the unusual step of asking this Court to grant certiorari in this case, even though the District Court found in its favor on all of the counts charged in its complaint and entered a final judgment of permanent injunction and even though the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in a unanimous decision affirmed the District Court, and even though the commission believes that both lower courts were correct in their holding and in their conclusion that scienter was not required in the commission injunctive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.961" offset="9155166">In doing that, I think it is important to understand what the commission is contending in this court and perhaps more importantly what it is not contending in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.318" offset="9192678">As this Court knows, in the past several years the commission has participated before this Court in several cases where private parties have raised important issues under the federal securities laws and have raised questions regarding the scope and effectiveness of those laws, and oftentimes the commission and I appearing on behalf of the commission or the Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the commission have appeared before the Court to express the view that private damage actions play an essential role in the enforcement of the federal securities laws, that they serve as an essential supplement to the commission's own enforcement actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.781" offset="9330500">Well, the Court's message has been I think that however laudable the purpose of private actions, the proper scope of those private actions is to enforce the federal securities laws are quite limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.790" offset="9374490">The Court's restrictions I think of the substantive provisions that can serve as a basis for private enforcement of the federal securities laws, as in the Lewis v. Transamerica case, the Court's definitions of the requirements for private actions to enforce the federal securities laws, as under the Blue Chip Stamps and Hochfelder case, have had a number of significant effects on how the laws are enforced, and I think perhaps the most significant effect that it has had is the fact that it has shifted the balance of the manner in which these laws have to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.464" offset="9501236">The government, which has always had the primary role for enforcing the federal securities laws has to take on now an even greater burden, and that is why we are here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.266" offset="9604472">The commission has had a long experience with injunctions under 20(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.988" offset="9623280">As a practical matter, what is the effect of a permanent injunction against a brokerage firm or whoever issued by the SEC?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph C. Ferrara</label>
            <text syncTime="2388.390" offset="9656926">Well, I think that the injunction has three very critical things -- well, let me respond in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.975" offset="9699244">One, the injunctive provision is the commission's principal enforcement tool, the only tool that we really have against the great masses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.288" offset="9736547">We don't assess fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.686" offset="9742085">We don't assess penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.060" offset="9751594">We only seek injunctions, with the exception of the regulated community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.819" offset="9770611">So it is our primary enforcement tool, and the commission is primarily a law enforcement agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.630" offset="9793912">We are unlike the FCC and the host of other independent regulatory agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.343" offset="9808750">We are not primarily a regulator or a licensor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.012" offset="9819408">We are a law enforcement agency, and this is our principal tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.817" offset="9830588">Now, what does the injunction do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.145" offset="9835917">Well, we think that it brings the defendant's attention in a very focused way to his past infractions, it lays down in an admonition for the defendant as to what is expected of him in the future, and it gives -- it stimulates I think future compliance with the federal securities laws through a judicial mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.801" offset="9910627">It is those three objectives that we seek in seek-injunctive actions, and that is really again all we have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2459.848" offset="9942810">Well, there are some collateral consequences that attach to the issuance of an injunction. Certainly, those who have been found to have carelessly engaged in misconduct which results in a deception of investors and a federal District Court judge has found it reasonably likely to recur and they are therefore enjoined are going to suffer some inconveniences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.600" offset="10025775">On the other hand, the statutory collateral consequences that can attach to the entry of an injunctive decree are largely discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.702" offset="10070183">In other words, any defendant in an injunctive action that has a collateral consequence attach, a regulatory disability, for example, of not being able to serve as an investment adviser to an investment company, a regulatory disability that relates to whether or not that issuer, if it is an issuer of securities, can use the Regulation A exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.976" offset="10143326">All of those collateral consequences are discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.860" offset="10158791">The defendant in injunctive proceeding can seek to have the regulatory collateral consequences not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.149" offset="10192018">The commission has to take into account all of the factors that are raised by the respondent in that collateral proceeding, he has full review in the courts of appeals, the courts of appeals have been very rigorous with the commission, saying that they cannot act arbitrarily or capriciously in having the collateral consequences attach -- I mean, there is a host of protections.</text>

            <text syncTime="2570.327" offset="10384697">The two specific regulatory disabilities I believe is that under section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act, the enjoined broker-dealer, if it had an investment adviser subsidiary, would be precluded from serving as an investment adviser to a registered investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.228" offset="10448332">That had no application in this case because Aaron &amp; Company as far as I know did not have an investment adviser subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.757" offset="10474350">When that does happen, section 9(c) of the Investment Company Act allows the defendant to come in to the commission and seek to have that regulatory disability waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.594" offset="10505697">Usually what happens when a broker-dealer or investment adviser is involved in an injunctive action, is that the regulatory disability and the injunctive proceeding are resolved all at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.285" offset="10536521">The second disability that comes into play is that the broker-dealer may not be able to participate in offerings of securities under Regulation A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.522" offset="10573511">That is an exemption from the full registration provisions of the federal securities laws, but again that regulatory disability can be waived pursuant to the provisions of Regulation A itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.251" offset="10612381">Now, can the injunction ever be lifted?</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.667" offset="10621994">The courts have procedures for lifting the injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.462" offset="10641220">I believe this Court in the Swift case laid down what the standards are and that at any time, conceivably from the day after the injunction has been entered to any time in the future, the defendant in an injunctive proceeding can go back before a federal District Court and ask to have the injunctive decree resolved because of reasons articulated by the Court in the Swift case.</text>
