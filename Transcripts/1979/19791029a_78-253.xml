            <text syncTime="19.261" offset="180433">This is a school desegregation case involving the Dallas Independent School District which is situated primarily in the City of Dallas, Texas, although the boundaries are not coterminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.104" offset="255770">Involved in this case is remedy and remedy alone with respect to this petitioner which I will hereinafter refer to as the School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.550" offset="309582">The Estes petitioners are the School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.277" offset="324524">Our position is --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="56.720" stopTime="82.344">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="56.720" offset="330271">At your convenience, Mr. Whitham, and perhaps your friends will comment on the same, first this case is here now because we have granted the writ, but are there any issues in this case that could not have been resolved after the District Courts have carried out the remand directions?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_whitham" startTime="82.344" stopTime="629.996">
            <label>Mr. Warren Whitham</label>
            <text syncTime="82.344" offset="432776">There is a great issue involved here, and I think it becomes even a greater issue, Mr. Chief Justice, in view of this Court's recent opinions in Columbus and Dayton of last July which in effect may well bring all of us, North and South, East and West, to a common problem if de jure segregation is now to be, in effect, arrived at either by old State law or constitution, or by the inability to overcome presumptions and evidentiary matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.264" offset="612394">The issue here is, Mr. Chief Justice, to return to your question, if I may, whether or not the elimination of all one race schools, given the urban condition in the large urban school district described by the courts below and in these petitions, is the controlling factor to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.872" offset="730885">I may well be rising to ask this Court to take the great broad principles enunciated in Swann, perhaps address those again, perhaps recognize that the lower courts have taken those principles and taken the tools referred to in that case, be it transportation, attendant zone changes, satelliting, paring, clustering, to address the question of whether the tools discussed have somehow or other been elevated to the principles of Swann, a circumstance that I would respectfully suggest is creating untold turmoil for the district courts of this land and the school boards of this land in trying to find out what is a plan that would ultimately arrive at a unitary school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.706" offset="1022203">The district court in this case formulated a plan which the school district initially opposed, but in an effort to get out of court, to become that stranger to school desegregation proceedings that the Fifth Circuit accuses us of not being, the school board, 9 to nothing, has voted to support this plan of the district court, and this plan was remanded by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.232" offset="1180296">So yes, I stand here readily admitting that this court has taken a case where technically the court of appeals has rejected the plan and this school district is here urging that this Court affirm the district court's plan as being a solution for public education in the urban environment, given the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.040" offset="1303489">Now, what are some of the facts that bring us here, this long history they speak of of Dallas School District litigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="309.861" offset="1342777">And before I get into that, let me say, remedy is all that's involved -- I want to emphasize that -- this school district recognizes it is located in a State that by State constitution required separation of the races.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.497" offset="1405367">This school district recognizes it had a first and prior desegregation lawsuit pending against it, filed in 1955 following Brown II.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.072" offset="1451656">It had a history in the courts until 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.451" offset="1469210">Admittedly through that plan in 1967, a stair step plan reached its final implementation.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.797" offset="1506513">This school district is cognizant of this Court's observations concerning stair step plans, and we are not here saying that's the beginning and the end, and that we should not still be searching for a remedy, in view of prior language of this Court, concerning stair step plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.240" offset="1592299">But on October 6, 1970, a new plan was formulated for this -- or a new lawsuit, a new school desegregation lawsuit was filed by separate parties representing black and Mexican-American students.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.076" offset="1667636">In this lawsuit, we have the problem of formulating now, and the district court had a problem of formulating, and this school board was charged with the duty of drafting a plan that had these difficult components; that there had been numerous demographic changes partly as a result of the prior desegregation order and remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.773" offset="1774425">It is now a minority Anglo school district, and a tri-ethnic remedy is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.956" offset="1815176">At the time of the first remedy hearing in July of 1971, the school district was probably 59 percent Anglo and a lesser percent black and Mexican-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.109" offset="1879855">At the time this second hearing was held in February of 1976, from which hearing the plan now before this Court came about, the district had dropped to 41 percent Anglo, 44.5 percent black, and 13.4 percent Mexican-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.715" offset="2002213">Now, the first appeal in the July of '71 remedy which the school district supported -- the school district supported whatever the district court there ordered -- the Fifth Circuit sent it back, but the Fifth Circuit itself sat on that case for virtually four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.078" offset="2095731">Summer of '71 you have the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.773" offset="2110464">December 2 of '71 you have oral argument in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.065" offset="2131675">July 23, 1975, you finally have an opinion from the Fifth Circuit with respect to the July of '71 remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.265" offset="2176397">Therefore we start again on hearings February 2, 1976, on how to formulate a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.554" offset="2209625">Again, no question of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.732" offset="2218297">The school district has put that aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.304" offset="2232613">The school district simply wants to find out what it is that the district court and the court of appeals can finally come to agree upon as a remedy for a large urban school district with an ever-decreasing Anglo population and with an ever-increasing minority population, and being in the Southwest with a remarkable ever-growing Mexican-American population.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.791" offset="2358523">At this time, as of this October, if the district court were to now be formulating a plan, it would be looking at October's figures where it has now dropped to Anglo of 32.2 percent, Mexican-American of 17.26 percent, and black of 49.4 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.009" offset="2483388">Over the ten years that this second desegregation case has been pending involving the Dallas Independent School District, there has been a drop of minus 58 percent of the Anglo population, as of the day I stand here, in this school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.277" offset="2576488">There has been an increase of 17.3 percent in the black scholastic population, and these figures are scholastic, not total people population --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="629.996" offset="2623404">And the percentages.</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren Whitham</label>
            <text syncTime="631.385" offset="2628942">And the percentages, and there, as to the Mexican-American scholastic population, has been an amazing increase in this 10-year period of 56.7 percent of Mexican-American children.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.585" offset="2697697">Now, how did we come to this circumstance?</text>
            <text syncTime="655.571" offset="2725700">We are in the strange circumstance that Mexican-Americans were never separated by State law in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.496" offset="2753390">They were treated as white.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.556" offset="2761644">From this point on, if I refer to Anglo, black and Mexican-American, I am speaking in terms of desegregation as we speak of it in the American Southwest, to have descriptive terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.939" offset="2823084">On July 16, 1971, the district court made a finding of liability against the school district that there were vestiges of a state imposed school system as to blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.279" offset="2868537">As I say, from that point on we ceased to fight about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.936" offset="2879091">We accepted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.940" offset="2883166">Let's come to the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.714" offset="2890271">The district court, though, did a strange thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.386" offset="2900929">The district court made a specific finding that there was no de jure showing that the plaintiffs had failed in their burden of proof to show de jure segregation of the Mexican-American student; however, the district court ordered that the Mexican-American be treated as a separate ethnic group for purposes of a desegregation remedy, and in its July 23, 1975 opinion, the court of appeals affirmed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.775" offset="3030497">Therefore, and this court --</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.368" offset="4196812">Time and distance studies were used simply as an excuse to get around Swann's great dilemma, and I must hurry and say what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.530" offset="4237458">When you say there is to be no requirement of racial balance, but you say on the other hand, you must eliminate one-race schools, you leave the lower courts and school boards with a tremendous difficulty of how do you accommodate to that dilemma?</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.636" offset="4313945">That dilemma must be resolved in the urban condition, but when the court of appeals sent this case back, it overlooked the record on time and distance as surely as anything in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.494" offset="4373400">The plaintiff's own witness, Professor Willie, on Appendix 51 you will see his statement, "I made time and distance studies and it takes too long to go from North Dallas to East Oak Cliff," which is the predominantly thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.864" offset="4438810">The plaintiff's own lawyer, my friend and brother, Mr. Cloutman, who will argue here, made a time and distance study and let it go at that, where it would take 35 minutes and 22 miles to get from the predominant white area to the predominant black area, and he admits he made that test on noon on a Sunday, which is completely illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.722" offset="4530239">But the Fifth Circuit had that before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.491" offset="4541315">The court of appeals had before it the court's own expert witness who said, "You can't do crosstown bussing that requires a travel time greater than 30 minutes," and they recognized that when they formulated their plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.246" offset="5384338">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case, does the Constitution mandate forced transportation of students in the previously segregated State school system where private housing patterns are racially imbalanced, is one that concerns Curry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.505" offset="5457377">The Court has previously answered that question yes, and it has done it on two assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.123" offset="5479842">One, it is assumed that because there was once State-enforced segregation it somehow happened to create the racial imbalance which exists in the housing pattern, and the second is the assumption that once that imbalance is created, the school system can remedy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.956" offset="5551208">It is Curry's position that both of those assumptions are false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.494" offset="5569390">In this case, both of those assumptions have been held by the district court as a fact not to have existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.092" offset="5595721">The district court found that it was private housing patterns which caused the racial imbalance, not anything that was ever done by the Dallas Independent School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.409" offset="5636995">And indeed, the experience of Dallas post 1965, during the time that the court was mandating all student assignments, would amply indicate that that finding is true and is based on the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.747" offset="5694360">During that period there was a fluid movement of schools that went from all white to all black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.344" offset="5716720">In 1971, children were bussed from South Oak Cliff High School, an all-black school, to Carter High School, a predominantly white school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.131" offset="5763845">In 1976 the effort was how to relieve Carter High School, which was then a some 75 or 80 percent black school from its predominantly minority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.285" offset="5808462">But in 1965 when the Fifth Circuit adopted a racially neutral school policy, South Oak Cliff was an all-white school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.838" offset="5850676">The shifting populations, the integration of the city, is a whole different thing; you are dealing with a different problem than was dealt with in the Fifties or the post-Brown in the period of school districts attempting to maintain segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.522" offset="5913475">But even more vividly pointed out is the false assumption that the school district can remove one-race schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.975" offset="5943254">In city after city after city circuit courts and indeed this Court have ordered school districts to racially change the makeup of their cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.237" offset="5988289">You've asked them to eliminate one-race schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.427" offset="6001037">You might as well ask these to nail currant jelly to the wall, because they've been unable to do it unless you concede, unless you believe that Detroit has succeed in eliminating one-race schools, or Cleveland, or Oakland, or Kansas City, or Atlanta, or the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.717" offset="6074284">If that's the perception of having eliminated the one-race school, then perhaps it's possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.639" offset="6097899">But in fact what has happened in case after case after case, and what has happened in the Dallas Independent School District, is that every attempt by the district court and every attempt by a school district to mandate student assignment, to force transport, to rearrange the school district, has met with a minority isolated district itself, one in which any hope for integrated education dies, and one ultimately that loses the community support so vital to a school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.493" offset="6229347">In this case we have testimony from Dr. Coleman, who you know is the noted sociologist, the father of the Coleman Report, the authority on school segregation, the one who wrote the report in 1960, that the result of this type of transportation will ultimately be a resegregated district.</text>

            <text syncTime="2300.555" offset="9305631">Yes, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.333" offset="9324753">The reason that we're here complaining of the court of appeals' opinion might be best stated by just reading the applicable portion of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.699" offset="9370206">The court of appeals says - "We cannot properly review any student assignment plan that leaves many schools in a system one race without specific findings by the district court as to the feasibility of these techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.493" offset="9417331">There are no adequate time and distance studies in the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.039" offset="9431542">Consequently we have no means of determining whether the natural boundaries and traffic considerations preclude either paring and clustering of schools or the use of transportation to eliminate the large number of one-race schools still existing."</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.862" offset="9478771">Now, Mr. Whitham stated that this is a remedy case I think you can go a little further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.037" offset="9499564">This case really only involves questions of student assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.416" offset="9517014">There are no issues here regarding site selection, faculty desegregation, school administration, single-member school districts, or any of these kinds of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.385" offset="9556929">As a matter of fact, there is a specific finding by the district judge that the school board was in good faith subsequent to 1971, attempting to meet the Swann requirements following the Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.782" offset="9618474">Now, our concern is that in a situation where, at March 1 of this year, there were only about 40,000 Anglo students, slightly over 40,000 Anglo students left in the school district, of which 38,000 under the plan, if you turn to the respondent plaintiff's brief, were already in statistically or numerically integrated schools, that there simply weren't enough school students, Anglo students, left to transport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.249" offset="9744384">As a matter of fact, in the government's brief they acknowledge that at March 1, only 8 percent of the schools of the Anglo students in the Dallas Independent School District were going to predominantly Anglo schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.001" offset="9803421">Now, we would like to point out to this court that there aren't very many Anglo students left in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.392" offset="9840933">The few that are left are, a good percentage of the few that are left, are in naturally integrated neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.630" offset="9869876">In view of the court of appeals' opinion, and it was aware of these facts, or at least the record was before it, we are concerned that the effect of their decision to order time and distance studies is to effectively order transportation of students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.496" offset="9929331">We certainly agree, Justice Stewart, that the Swann decision does not require bussing, but what we are concerned with, as I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist was concerned with in the Valdosta case, where this Court rejected certiorari, petition for certiorari, but over his objection, that the court of appeals is too concerned with one-race schools, and that you could have the absurd result in this case of in fact, an order of having -- pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.050" offset="10067571">You could have the absurd result of having transportation of Anglo students or black students from naturally desegregated areas where they consensually elected to live together, to other parts of the school district in order to eliminate one-race schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="2654.820" offset="10722617">Now, the conspicuous problem with the remedial order that reached the court of appeals in this case was the large number of one-race schools that would remain under that order and the large percentage of black students, the ones found to have been discriminated against, who would still attend them, according to the court of appeals' figures approximately 66 of the 176 schools would remain one-race schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.341" offset="10880711">There are other ways of looking at the figures in this record, but they all come out showing that substantially more than a quarter of the schools would remain one race, and perhaps even more significantly, 59 percent of the black school children would be attending one-race schools, schools in which more than 90 percent of the students would be minority students.</text>

            <text syncTime="2840.896" offset="11467003">Here under this court's decision, reaffirmed last term, there is a burden on the school board to show that the extent to which there remain substantially disproportionate or one-race schools in the system was not the result of the pattern of illegal conduct that had been mandated by law over a period of generations, and that presumptively affected the development of the entire community, the sitting, the capacities of schools, the growth of residential areas, depending on access to schools, and the entire development of community that was built around a legal system that mandated racial separation in the schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.884" offset="11778905">This can occur due to residential patterns in cities where there may have been some de jure acts that added to segregation in those cases under this Court's decision require an inquiry into the incremental effect of de jure acts on the racial separation that otherwise would have existed as a guide to the remedy that should be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.533" offset="11897501">In cases of this sort, that is not the approach that the court has taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.332" offset="11924668">But rather the court has stated, as we quote on page 42 of our brief in this long case that there is the burden on the school authorities to satisfy the court that the racial composition of those schools that remain predominantly of one race after a pattern of generations of mandated racial separation, that the remainder of those schools are not the result of present or past discriminatory action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.724" offset="12050265">That was the question that was before the court of appeals, whether there were findings made by the district court that would satisfy that the school district had satisfied that burden here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.443" offset="12113168">The reason why this problem was as conspicuous as it was to the court of appeals is not merely because of the more generalized formulations in this court's opinions that the adequacy of a remedy to disestablish a dual system of this kind is to be measured by its effectiveness, but because more specifically of the fact that the last time the court of appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld as constitutionally adequate a desegregation plan --</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.708" offset="12366242">The reason the problem was so conspicuous is because the last time this court of appeals upheld as adequate a remedy in such a system that preserved a comparable number and percentage of one-race schools, this Court unanimously reversed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.532" offset="12445550">This was some years ago; it was in Davis v. the Mobile School Commissioners, and the situation was very comparable to the one involved here, the figures referred to in this Court's opinion showed that 64 percent of the black elementary school children and a majority of the junior high school and senior high school students would remain in one-race schools, an aggregate figure that obviously would come out very close to the 59 percent that's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.395" offset="12596955">And the Court unanimously held that the tools specified in the Swann case should be considered before this kind of racial isolation should be upheld, and when the district court looked more specifically -- when the court of appeals locked more specifically here at the reasons why the remedy adopted left so many children in one-race schools, they found that the problems had not shown that the burden of the school board had been met here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3620.203" offset="14584142">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court, on behalf of the NAACP, it is the NAACP's position that this is a dual segregated de jure system that has never been desegregated, and that it is not desegregated by the student assignment plan that was adopted by the district judge in this case in accordance with the instructions that were given to the district judge in 1975, directing that district judge specifically to this Court's holding in Swann and directing that district judge to use the tools and techniques set out in Swann.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.321" offset="14788629">The reason the NAACP submit that this student assignment plan does not desegregate the Dallas Independent School District is, one, the exclusion of high school students 9 dash 12 from inclusion in this student assignment plan; two, the number of one-race schools that were left one-race without any justification, the NAACP submits; three, the exclusion of kindergarten dash third grade students from inclusion in the plan; and four, the creation of an all-black district which was totally written off by the district judge below, locking in more than 26,000 students with the only method of getting out of that all-black district using a transfer form, that is that they themselves either opt out by magnet concept, attending a magnet school, or majority to minority transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.393" offset="15108995">We submit, the NAACP submits that the court of appeals below was correct in remanding this case back to the district judge for additional findings, and the NAACP would submit that this was a very moderate order, and when you look at the order entered by the 5th Circuit in this case, and specifically moderate when you compare it with the order that was rendered by this same court in this same case in July of 1975, when it specifically directed the district judge to utilize the tools that this court set out in Swann, and that this school district has never fully utilized, and further went on to tell that district judge to do it by the second semester or second term of the 1975-76 school year, which was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.449" offset="15377220">Addressing myself to the four glaring errors that the NAACP submits that clearly indicates that this student assignment plan does not comply with this Court's ruling in Swann is the exclusion of the high school students 9 dash 12, which in effect is a neighborhood concept for these high school students, and with the indication that the only method of desegregating these high school students was a magnet concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.260" offset="15548374">They have six magnet high schools plus skyline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.257" offset="15564361">The magnet concept has been a failure in the Dallas Independent School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.070" offset="15587662">Less than 2,500 students are enrolled in the magnet concepts right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.411" offset="15617024">At the time, in 1976, there were approximately 3,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.255" offset="15644400">The magnet concept has failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.034" offset="15655476">The other two referred to by the district judge for the desegregation of the high school students nine dash 12, the majority to minority transfer, is a failure in the Dallas Independent School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.101" offset="15723813">1,403 students out of a total population of better than 131,000 have taken advantage of the majority to minority transfer program, and 96 percent of those were black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.068" offset="15791626">Therefore, with respect to the high school students 9 dash 12, the NAACP submits that there is no effective desegregation in accordance with this Court's holding in Swann.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.945" offset="15847111">The second point, the number of one-race schools left in this district, approximately 76 out of a total of 177, at the time that this order was entered 48 of those schools were Negro schools; 25 of those schools were Anglo schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.602" offset="15953795">At the present time there are 76 one-race schools still existing in the Dallas Independent School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.620" offset="15993814">62 of those schools are black schools, and to that you add 14 combined, and you have, you come up with 76 one-race schools that the court of appeals below said that there was no factual finding, and the court of appeals below did not simply rely upon the fact that there was a large number of one-race schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="4786.852" offset="19250761">The unexplained exclusion of high school grades from any part of the plan without any justification in the record we think all by itself requires a remand for hearings and a new plan to include those very schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.252" offset="19316381">By way of example, the maps you have before you demonstrate the absolute feasibility of desegregation in Grades 4 through 8 in a precisely identical manner that the high schools may be integrated throughout Dallas, and you are using older students.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.576" offset="19377716">No rationale in the record or in the court's findings exists for their exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.852" offset="19394748">For that reason alone the 5th Circuit was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.865" offset="19406869">The 5th Circuit also points out indirectly, and there is no rationale given in the court's findings, the exclusion of K-3.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.315" offset="19440619">Now, while this court said in Swann the age of children may be considered, there is no explanation, no rationale, and no evidence in the trial record regarding the exclusion of those children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.244" offset="19488371">For that reason again, and the fact that the exclusion of high schools and K-3 centers from a student assignment plan results in basically close to 100 one-race administrative units.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.477" offset="19537272">Those children in K-3 centers do not attend class with students of another race in over 100 cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="5521.398" offset="22189014">Let me reply briefly to some things I have heard here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.761" offset="22202389">First, the Plaintiff's Plans A and B and the NAACP plan all proposed magnet schools, so they were for them to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.229" offset="22244289">Second, the plaintiffs, in effect, have abandoned their plans and counsel has so admitted to me, Mr. Cloutman, and never urged them in the 5th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.637" offset="22281906">Oddly enough, following the entry of the district court student assignment plan and its total remedy, Mr. Cloutman, my brother, filed a motion for attorney's fees as the prevailing party under the Educational Amendments Act of 1972, and received a substantial award of attorney's fees from the district court on the theory that he was the prevailing party, that is that the plaintiffs were, and he represented to the court and the court so found, and you will find this in our brief and in the appendices, that virtually every precept and proposal that the plaintiffs had made to the district court had been incorporated in the district court's remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.629" offset="22473853">Next, we should consider my brother, Mr. Cunningham's, language about K-3. Consider the following language admitted to by Mr. Cunningham - "The members of the NAACP can see justification possibly for K through 3 because we are dealing with young children the first time in school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5619.101" offset="22579806">I have talked with some teachers and they explain that these kids may lose or may have problems," et cetera, end of quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.221" offset="22608227">That admission was made to the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.607" offset="22633827">We are dealing here with the desegregation of systems, school systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5638.021" offset="22655457">This court recognized in Keyes that the plaintiffs had never had to prove separation of the races by individual school building or individual student, and that reference is contained in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5653.799" offset="22718568">It is the system that we must look to, the entire system, and how to desegregate it given the awesome urban problems that we deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.387" offset="22768933">There is a valid, proper constitutional issue before this Court and this Court, now given Columbus and Dayton of last summer, will ultimately have to live with it, and in the name of help for the urban condition, North and South, it must be addressed in the framework of what this district judge has tried to do for an urban condition, regardless of whether it's in a State that sent its troops to the Army of Northern Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5701.395" offset="22908949">And that issue is, from a constitutional standpoint, if there is a remedy to be corrected for a violation of the equal protection clause, that must be a constitutional question, and again we must address the problem of what is the definition of a one-race school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.440" offset="23001109">Nowhere is that addressed.</text>
