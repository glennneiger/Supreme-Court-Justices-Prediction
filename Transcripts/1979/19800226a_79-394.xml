            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="73.672" offset="398085">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.919" offset="411042">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.555" offset="433612">The question presented is whether a proceeding to recover a civil penalty under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for an oil spill is a criminal case within the meaning of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.900" offset="490977">The issue arises because of the interplay in this case between the reporting and penalty provisions of Section 311 of the Act, which I shall briefly described.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.242" offset="536325">The Federal Water Pollution Control Act which is now commonly known as the Clean Water Act establishes a comprehensive program for restoring and maintaining the integrity of the Nation's waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.983" offset="579271">Section 311 is specifically directed to the problem of oil spills and discharges of hazardous substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.016" offset="607483">This provision was first enacted in roughly its present form in 1970, principally in response to the widely publicized oil spill in the Santa Barbara Channel and the break-up of the tanker Torrey Canyon which caused extensive damage to the coast of England and cost better than $8 million to clean up.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.794" offset="678536">Section 311(b)(3) states the basic prohibition which is against the discharge of harmful quantities of oil and hazardous substances into navigable waters of the United States, adjoining shorelines or into the seas contiguous to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.178" offset="748126">The Act provides for a national contingency plan to deal with oil spills and hazardous substance discharges when they occur and it also authorizes the President to provide for the clean up of those discharges unless the President is satisfied that the owner/operator of the vessel or facility where the discharge occurs will adequately clean it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.336" offset="844675">In order that the Federal Government can insure that these clean up and mitigation measures are taken promptly and thereby limit the ensuing damage, Section 311(b)(5), one of the sections in which the issue in this case centers, requires the person in charge of the vessel or facility to notify the appropriate agency of the Federal Government immediately when a prohibitive discharge occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.124" offset="955852">The failure to do so is a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.606" offset="969749">Congress was sensitive to the Fifth Amendment concerns of this reporting requirement, however, and expressly provided in it that the notification to the appropriate agency of the Government and information derived from exploitation of that notice may not be used in any criminal case except in a prosecution for perjury or for submitting a false statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.362" offset="1056789">While the Government does clean up the discharge rather than leaving it to the individual owner/operator to do the Government can in return recover the cost of the clean-up from the responsible owner/operator, except that the owner/operator has statutory defense as to liability in certain cases such as where the discharge was caused by God or an act of war, it was the responsibility of the United States or the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.442" offset="1153128">Moneys recovered from the owners/operators for the Government's clean-up costs are then in turn paid into a special statutory revolving fund established under the Act and this revolving fund is then used to clean up other oil spills and is in turn replenished when the owners and operators pay back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.912" offset="1230973">The owner/operator may also be liable under State or other provisions of Federal law for damages to private property resulting from an oil spill, and aside from the question of clean up.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="292.649" offset="1273919">$500 doesn't go very far in cleaning up oil spills.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.057" offset="1299623">Is there much in it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="301.715" stopTime="605.348">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="301.715" offset="1310281">I do not know the present balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.368" offset="1316864">I do know that when the Act was initially passed appropriated funds were placed into it and the authorization at the original time was $35 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.685" offset="1370154">I would also point out that based on the 1973 statistics that we put in the petition for certiorari it appeared that there were 14,000 oil spills that the Government was aware of under this Act and something like 8,000 of those cases the Government was able to trace the spill to a particular source.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.704" offset="1466180">So while the penalty in a particular case, in this case for example $250, might be small in an individual case those penalties would accumulate and make up a substantial portion of the Funds in this statutory fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.814" offset="1554578">In addition to the liability to the United States for clean-up and possible liability to third parties for damages to property Section 311(b)(6), the other provision that is specifically involved here, provides that the owner or operator or the person in charge of the facility -- anyone of these -- shall be assessed a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding $5,000 whenever a prohibited discharge occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.270" offset="1664502">The Coast Guard has construed this statute to require that at least some penalty be assessed in every case but the statute itself requires that the amount of the penalty within that $5,000 range be tailored according to the gravity of the particular violation, the size of the business concerned and the effect of the penalty on the ability of the owner/operator to remain in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.474" offset="1757288">The civil penalty case now before the Court resulted from an oil spill at Respondent's property near Enid, Oklahoma on March 23, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.633" offset="1801906">At that time about 20 barrels of combination oil and mud apparently escaped from the retention pit at the drilling facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.237" offset="1836283">On March 25 the sanitarian with the State Health Department was conducting a routine inspection for other purposes nearby and noticed that oil had seeped out of the retention pit, had run down a gully and into a stream by the name of Boggie Creek.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.729" offset="1902320">Respondent does not contest in this Court that Boggie Creek is a navigable water within the meaning of the Act or that the amount of oil discharged in this case is harmful for purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.630" offset="1949863">On the same day that the State sanitarian observed the spill the State Health Department notified Respondent of the spill, Respondent notified EPA of the spill eight days later as he was required to do order Section 311(b)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="480.706" offset="2026245">On June 25 Respondent submitted a more complete report pursuant to an EPA request under another provision of the Clean Water Act administered by EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.589" offset="2085700">EPA then forwarded these reports to the Coast Guard which relied upon them in assessing a civil penalty against Respondent in the amount of $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.052" offset="2119555">Respondent filed an administrative appeal from this assessment, contending that the use of the required reports to assess the civil penalty constituted a violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination but this appeal was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.621" offset="2181831">Respondent then filed an action in District Court seeking to enjoin enforcement of these provisions and enjoin collection of the civil penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.282" offset="2212551">The Government soon thereafter filed a collection action to recover the unpaid civil penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.280" offset="2244524">The District Court consolidated these two cases and denied Respondent's motion for summary judgment, again raising the Fifth Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.188" offset="2272110">The court then determined that Respondent -- that the oil spill at Respondent's property had violated the Act but reduced the civil penalty that had been assessed in the amount of $500 by the Coast Guard to $250, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.816" offset="2326653">One, what the court believed to be the relatively insubstantial amount of oil that had been spilled, although it was still a violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.335" offset="2356746">And, secondly, taking into account what the court believed was Respondent's diligence in cleaning up the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.164" offset="2387989">The Court of Appeals reversed the award of the civil penalty to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.844" offset="2406797">Despite Congress' expressed designation of the penalty as civil the Court of Appeals perceived certain punitive aspects to it and therefore determined that it was criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.301" offset="2448593">The court did not enjoin enforcement of the civil penalty provision or the required notice provision of the Act but simply applied immunity providing that the required notice and information derived from that notice could not be used in assessing either the liability for or the amount of the civil penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="645.973" offset="2687248">Well, no, I am sorry, the Helvering -- right -- I suppose that could have been indirectly implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.977" offset="2711280">But in Helvering the question was whether that was a violation of the double jeopardy clause, because the defendant in Helvering had been acquitted of criminal fraud against the United States and then the question came whether the Government was barred by double jeopardy from -- by the double jeopardy clause from recovering the penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="673.006" offset="2795395">Well, let me read you this language from Helvering v. Mitchell on page 309 of 303 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.604" offset="2817755">"In assessing income taxes the Government relies primarily upon the disclosure by the taxpayer of the relevant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.516" offset="2845445">This disclosure requires him to make in his annual return to insure full and honest disclosure to discourage fraudulent attempts to evade the Act Congress imposes sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.132" offset="2907930">Such sanctions may confessedly be either criminal or civil."</text>
            <text syncTime="705.092" offset="2923708">Doesn't that strike you as somewhat resembling the scheme here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="707.920" stopTime="771.449">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="707.920" offset="2935097">Yes, in that sense it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.840" offset="2942725">I guess I was focusing on the particular constitutional right that was involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.224" offset="2968221">But to that extent it certainly does, that the liability was based on the information in the tax return that was fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.729" offset="3010330">And in fact I think one of the implications of the Court's decision here, although it does not precisely explain what the scope of the decision was, is that it could have a disturbing impact on the wide number of both Federal and State statutes that are now moving more and more toward the use of civil penalties as an integral part of the regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.249" offset="3120358">And of course the provision for assessment of civil penalties under the tax statutes is one of the longstanding examples of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.731" offset="3154317">And it is being used more frequently in regulatory statutes, for instance the Occupational Safety and Health Act with safety provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="960.024" offset="3943424">And in this case the Court of Appeals approach, which disregards the Congress' clear designation of this particular penalty as civil and substitutes instead a judicially-fashioned standard of when a penalty is sufficiently punitive, that the court believes it should be regarded as criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.734" offset="4022314">We think it would embark the courts on a difficult course of line drawing in trying to distinguish which particular statutes might carry attributes that in the abstract might seem punitive even though the statute was designated by Congress as being civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.435" offset="4097128">And specifically with respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege the language of the privileges provides that no person should be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself and the debates on the proposal in the Bill of Rights in the House in 1789 indicate that the limitation to criminal cases was deliberately inserted in the Bill of Rights at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.671" offset="4210082">The term "criminal" of course appears in the Sixth Amendment as well in identifying those prosecutions in which Sixth Amendment rights attach and there is no reason to think that the first Congress intends to distinguish between the two.</text>

            <text syncTime="1209.300" offset="4940570">Well, in this case there is a report form in the appendix indicating the information given by Respondent in the course of a telephone conversation with a person at EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.638" offset="5001906">And in this case he did indicate that the U.S. spill had occurred on his premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.184" offset="5032103">This Court has repeatedly stated that the question of whether a given sanction of his criminal or civil is a question of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.490" offset="5069302">In the present case Congress could not have been clear in manifesting its intent that the sanction be civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.109" offset="5091767">It is designated as civil and the procedure for its collection is civil, a factor which the Court found persuasive in Helvering v. Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.889" offset="5126980">We must therefore assume that Congress used the term "civil" advisedly and that it affirmatively decided the attainment of a monetary penalty under the Clean Water Act should not carry with it the usual stigma that attaches to someone who is convicted of a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.804" offset="5194585">Indeed the administrative conference and the drafters of the model penal code and others have suggested that civil penalties be utilized instead of criminal provisions in regulatory statutes such as this for exactly that reason, to avoid the problem of exposing persons unnecessarily to the the use of the criminal process and to avoid stigmatizing persons who are exposed to the criminal process to the fact of criminal conviction when society at large would not usually regard the conduct of being worthy or deserving of that kind of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.161" offset="5340035">We do not believe in the present case, for example, that the oil spill on Respondent's property would ordinarily be of the type that would warrant bringing a criminal prosecution under some other statute such as the Rivers and Harbors Act and we do not understand that Respondent would suggest otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.464" offset="5409207">The civil penalty provision in Section 311(b)(5) can be contrasted we think instructively in this regard with the -- excuse me, Section 311(b)(6) can be contrasted with the criminal sanctions in Section 311(b)(5) for failing to report an oil spill to the Government, even where the owner/operator is wholly innocent with respect to the spill in the sense of not having been negligent or wilfull.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.017" offset="5511398">Congress evidently believed that even where the person in charge of the vessel or facility had not been negligent in causing the spill that the public interest in requiring prompt notification was sufficiently strong in order to prevent damages to third parties and prevent damage to the environment that the failure to report should carry criminal consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.767" offset="5614425">The civil nature of this, the penalty involved here is further underscored by the fact mentioned earlier that the civil penalties are paid along with the recoveries from persons responsible for spills into this statutory revolving fund, it has the effect of paying the Government's clean-up costs for those particular spills in which the cost cannot be recovered from the owner/operator who is responsible for the particular spill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.930" offset="5727065">The penalty can also be viewed as compensation to the Government acting parens patriae for the people of the Nation for what Congress "presumably believed was the damage to the environment in the waters that would occur even when an oil spill was cleaned up relatively promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.780" offset="5798536">It would be a transitory damage to the environment and in some cases an oil spill could not be entirely cleaned up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.600" offset="6693804">One other point I would like to make at this point is that the Respondent relies to a considerable extent on one of the factors mentioned in this Court's decision in Mendoza-Martinez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.939" offset="6735078">In that case the Court held that an expatriation provision under the Immigration Act for persons who departed the country to avoid military service was criminal and one of the factors mentioned in Mendoza-Martinez that could be looked to in discerning congressional intent is to whether a statute is criminal is whether the conduct regulated by the ostensibly regulatory or civil sanction is otherwise made criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.418" offset="6841031">We agree that this can be a relevant factor but in this case it happens to cut the other way, because this Court has said on a number of occasions the Congress -- as it has under the tax laws and others for example -- can attach both criminal and civil sanctions to the same conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.239" offset="6900276">And so where here Congress in the Refusa Act of 1899 has made the discharge of pollutants criminal and then in this particular statute designates the penalty as civil I think the inference can only be that Congress meant what it said.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.917" offset="7019081">And in Mendoza-Martinez, on the other hand, the fact that the conduct was otherwise made in criminal and in fact cut the other way because Mendoza-Martinez, the statute involved there was concerned with people who had violated the Selective Service laws were criminally liable but had left the country and were beyond the reach of criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.295" offset="7096508">And the legislative history of the statute made it unmistakably clear that what Congress intended to do was fill a gap in the criminal punishments under that statute by saying any citizen has left the country and we cannot prosecute him, then we will do the alternative of taking away his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.626" offset="7153873">And so while that is a factor, it is necessary to look at which way it cuts in a particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.691" offset="7786141">I would like to very briefly respond to certain questions that were asked of Mr. Kneedler and perhaps give an answer slightly in variance with that given by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.167" offset="7824071">With respect to the facts I believe that the Government left out two important considerations that the Court should bear in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.657" offset="7849984">Number one, there was no evidence in the court below that Ward or any of his employees were responsible for the spill that occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.902" offset="7886973">The Act of Congress makes the penalty imposed on the basis of strict liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.942" offset="7911111">Mr. Justice Stevens, for example, asked the question might the penalty be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.012" offset="7931382">There is no "might" about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.474" offset="7937233">The penalty is automatically imposed in every situation regardless of fault, regardless of clean-up, when there is an oil spill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.589" offset="7969729">And the penalty is imposed against the owner or the operator, not against the person responsible for the spill.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.836" offset="8058755">Let me explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.589" offset="8065755">Your Honor raised the question of Helvering v. Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.584" offset="8077667">There is a critical difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.815" offset="8082683">The information supplied in Helvering v. Mitchell, which was not a self-incrimination case in any event, was essentially neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.087" offset="8111731">And that case turned on another question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.236" offset="8124270">But the Supreme Court earlier had decided in Sullivan v. United States that the filing of an income tax return did not violate the Fifth Amendment clause dealing with self-incrimination, because the information was essentially neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.584" offset="8177664">But Mr. Justice Holmes in his opinion pointed out that if the information called for by filing the return would incriminate the taxpayer he need not provide that information.</text>

            <text syncTime="2039.992" offset="8263346">Now, that certainly doesn't suggest that the information is necessarily neutral.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.100" offset="8283721">Sir, as I read Helvering and Sullivan and the other income tax cases and also Byers which I wanted to speak to, the information is essentially neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.404" offset="8321024">There is in reality no penalty or sanction imposed upon someone that files an honest income tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.989" offset="8347355">All he has to do is pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.196" offset="8356133">Here, though, if you are not responsible for the oil spill you still have to pay the penalty, even if you take every effort to avoid an oil spill as General Motors did in United States v. General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.884" offset="8402944">The Coast Guard still assessed them a fine of $1,200 which the District Court cut to $1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.679" offset="8426036">The court inquired of counsel concerning Byers v. California and there are some critical differences in that case and this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.855" offset="8462817">As I read the Court's decision in Byers there are at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.813" offset="8478595">This Court in finding that the California hit and run statute, so-called hit and run statute did not violate the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.481" offset="8509315">It found first of all that the mere possibility of incrimination was insufficient and found also that driving a vehicle is a lawful activity and found that even if incriminating the report is not necessarily testimonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.455" offset="8561142">Now, let us contrast that with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.804" offset="8570546">Here, having an oil spill is an offense and that is the word used by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.524" offset="8597504">It is an offense for which a civil penalty is imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.863" offset="8614849">Number two, the report is clearly incriminating because it is on the basis of the report that the fine is assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.629" offset="8641912">And number three, the report clearly is testimonial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2145.332" offset="8684648">Which I was going to address but if I could just say the Court in California v. Byers pointed out that there are many accidents where there is no liability attached and certainly no criminal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.538" offset="8733550">Now, the heart of our case is that a proceeding to collect this penalty, even though denominated civil, is in reality a criminal case within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.584" offset="8789661">Counsel for the Government contracted the Fifth and Sixth Amendment but there is a critical difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.540" offset="8809514">The Sixth Amendment speaks of criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.587" offset="8821739">The Fifth Amendment speaks of criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.347" offset="8832711">And the Sixth Amendment guarantee has never been applied in an action to collect a civil penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.899" offset="8863013">But this Court and the State courts and the lower Federal courts, going back to the English system, have consistently applied the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment guarantees in actions to collect civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.605" offset="8925811">And that was the ruling of this Court in Boyd v. United States which has been reaffirmed either implicitly or -- implicitly in Lees v. United States, Hepner v. United States, Hogan v. United States and in Footnote 3 of Helvering v. Mitchell and U.S. v. U.S. Coin and Currency and in One 1958 Plymouth Sedan because the Court said in Boyd that an action to collect a civil penalty -- in that case $1,000 -- and the statute clearly said that it was non-criminal, this Court nevertheless found that the penalty was, in effect, quasi-criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.587" offset="9073768">And it required, if the Court will recall, in Boyd -- this was as I recall a statute involving an alien -- that you had to furnish certain reports and information to the Government; and if you did not furnish them, the penalty would be assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.711" offset="9134268">And the Court said, rightly so, that that was a violation of the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause even though it was denominated non-criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.465" offset="9173243">Now, the Government in its reply brief has taken issue with our history and I would just like to call to the Court's attention very briefly that each of the authorities cited by the Government, beginning with Dean Wigmore at Section 2256 of Volume 8, adopts our position that actions to collect civil penalties can violate the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.218" offset="9288286">The same position is taken in Greenleaf on Evidence, Taylor on Evidence and Mr. Joseph Story's Commentary on Equity Pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.843" offset="9334784">What the Government says is that this rule is not a constitutional rule, it is a rule of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.552" offset="9361533">But it overlooks the fact, as discussed in some length in Leonard Levy's classic The Origin of the Fifth Amendment, that in fact the Founding Fathers, the State constitutional conventions, the first Congress when it passed the Fifth Amendment had in mind these civil penalties which had been abused; and that the early cases make it clear that they were given the constitutional protection against the self-incrimination clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.547" offset="9469576">And, as I indicated, that has been the position of this Court, this Court has consistently applied the protection of the Fourth Amendment and the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment in actions to collect fines, penalties and forfeitures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.889" offset="9526941">Now, in this case even if this Court were writing on a clean slate, if there had never been Boyd, if there had not been this history --</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.259" offset="9844381">In Lees v. United States and Boyd v. United States the Court paid no attention and did not discuss at all that Mr. Boyd and Mr. Lees' answer might incriminate them in some other proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.253" offset="9892342">It was that they had to pay the fine, which I believe was $1,000 in those particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.255" offset="9916374">But, as I indicated, even if the Court did not have that history before it, it is clear that this particular statutory scheme is punitive beyond any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.010" offset="9963395">In the first place it is not referred to in any other way other than a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.266" offset="9984397">And this Court has held repeatedly in U.S. v. LeFranka, U.S. v. Tex-Tow, One 1956 Plymouth Sedan and U.S. v. Futura that penalties are imposed for punishment, whether they are criminal penalties or civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.043" offset="10063496">Number two, we have in this case the forced reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.106" offset="10079796">If you do not report this spill you can go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.423" offset="10097037">If you do report this spill you can be given a civil penalty of up to a quarter of a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.520" offset="10121488">In this particular case it was quite small $500 and then cut to $250.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.830" offset="10142699">But the statute as presently written authorizes a civil penalty of up to a quarter of a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.577" offset="10169657">Number three, the exact same conduct, the exact same conduct in this case is also a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.581" offset="10197661">The Refuse Act does not require scienter, the Government does not have to show intent to violate it; it is a strict liability statute and it is also a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.222" offset="10248234">So the same conduct here is also a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.561" offset="10265579">The action that is referred to here is called an offense, Congress makes it an offense to spill oil or for that matter be an owner or operator where oil is spilled, again showing the punitive nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.328" offset="10328691">And if there were any other question about it involved, we have cited on page 60 of our brief from page 3 of a Senate report that the whole purpose of passing this bill, or the original bill, the 1979 Act, was to punish oil spillers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.368" offset="10400893">So when we combine in a statutory network such phrases as penalty, offense, strict liability, and punishment, it is clear that what we have here is a punitive and not a remedial statute as this Court -- or at least some of the members of this Court considered in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.939" offset="10627114">The Government at attempts to have it both ways on the question of intent or scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.069" offset="10643623">It is not supposed to be a factor but yet in the Coast Guard regulations it is a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.920" offset="10663058">That was a factor troublesome to the Tenth Circuit in its opinion and they treated that at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.727" offset="10690330">But in addition to the factors that I have already mentioned that I think clearly show it is punitive, what convinced the Tenth Circuit unanimously that this was a proceeding within the Fifth Amendment were the factors that the Coast Guard used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.685" offset="10746128">Because the Tenth Circuit said, "Look, if the factors to be considered in assessing this penalty are for non-punitive, remedial regulatory purposes, then this penalty -- or this proceeding may not be a criminal case within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.071" offset="10819688">"On the other hand, if looking at these factors we find that they are not related to the regulatory goal that the Congress has put forward in the preamble to the Act," then they clearly are punitive."</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.135" offset="10867963">And the Court went down and looked at each of these factors and pulled out from the Coast Guard regulations themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.811" offset="10898578">For example, the Coast Guard considers the gravity of a violation, the prior history, the person -- the owner/operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.456" offset="10941210">It considers the effect of the fine on his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.129" offset="10955839">It considers how large his business is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.669" offset="10970049">But at the time it expressly would not under any circumstances consider the clean-up effort of the operator or the fact that all of the oil had been removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.949" offset="11023130">Now, the Tenth Circuit said that when you look at that it is clear that what Congress intended here was a punitive penalty and that it simply was attempting to have the hammer to beat over the head of the oil spiller in an attempt to clean up the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.646" offset="11093974">Now, one thing that I think the Court might wish to consider is that the Tenth Circuit, in our opinion appropriately so, decision does not adversely affect the enforcement of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.806" offset="11154578">The Circuit carved out a use immunity provision and it simply said this, that any information supplied by an owner or operator who is non-corporate cannot be used against him in assessing the penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2934.863" offset="11842853">Reason number one, they gave come interesting statistics concerning oil spills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.762" offset="11874408">It is obvious from reading those statistics prepared by the Coast Guard that the overwhelming majority of oil spills occur on facilities operated by corporate owners and therefore this Act would not apply to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.001" offset="11931355">As I calculate it that would be approximately 90 percent of the spills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.667" offset="11950059">Thirdly, this would not apply if there was not an immediate notification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.318" offset="11972629">So if the Court upheld the position of the Tenth Circuit the Act would not be retarded in its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.521" offset="12013484">We have in our brief at some length discussed the Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.457" offset="12037204">Quite frankly we believe that the factors used there are ambiguous and that Factors 1, 2 and 3 go either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.787" offset="12078477">We say however that Factors 4, 5, 6 and 7 point toward this being a punitive statute and that was the reasoning of the Tenth Circuit in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.707" offset="12138245">In the final analysis we bottom our position upon this Court's ruling in Boyd and that a reading of Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez and the statutory history and the statutory construction clearly show that this is a punitive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.766" offset="12214418">Now, the argument may be made that this is not a criminal case in the sense that Mr. Ward was not arrested, he wasn't indicted by a grand jury and therefore, as the Government says, it is clear by stipulation -- not by stipulation, but it is clear from reading the statute that the self-incrimination clause doesn't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.676" offset="12294040">But this Court has said in Ullman v. United States that the clause -- meaning the self-incrimination clause is not to be interpreted literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.420" offset="12325073">That is found at page 438.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.866" offset="12334791">In Counselman v. Hitchcock at page 562 this Court said it is impossible that the meaning of the constitutional provisions involving self-incrimination can only be that a person shall not be compelled to be a witness against himself in criminal prosecutions against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.284" offset="12404485">The reason for that of course is that until the post-Civil War period in Federal criminal cases a defendant could not even be a witness in a criminal case, either for himself or for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.643" offset="12449938">And of course that was the rule in most State prosecutions at the time the Fifth Amendment was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.747" offset="12474389">If we go down the history of the Fifth Amendment before this Court, this Court has defined the words "criminal case" which after all are the most important words in this case, to have a broader meaning than simply in a situation where an individual has been indicted by a grand jury and forced to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.699" offset="12566131">And of course the leading came in that respect is Boyd v. United States, although there are others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.866" offset="12598836">In the final analysis, Boyd says that the mischief against which the Fifth Amendment is there to protect appears in its most attractive form to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.595" offset="12661739">And that is what we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.215" offset="12672188">There is a natural concern by everyone to keep the waters clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.254" offset="12688384">That is our concern as shown by the fact that Mr. Ward promptly moved to clean it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.133" offset="12711894">The Government says, "But this will inhibit other civil penalties."</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.049" offset="12731538">It will not inhibit any other civil penalty because there is no other civil penalty currently on the books similar to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.469" offset="12761213">But if this Court lets down the guard and allows this type of compulsory reporting to come forward, then I respectfully submit that the Fifth Amendment would be emasculated and that it will be a stunted right against self-incrimination.</text>
