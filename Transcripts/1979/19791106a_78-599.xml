            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear oral argument next in 78-599, Secretary of the Navy v. Huff.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.263" offset="300387">I think you may proceed whenever you are ready, Mr. Jones.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="53.142" offset="315956">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.447" offset="329122">This case is being argued in tandem with Brown v. Glines, in which the Court just heard argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.252" offset="352423">The respondents brought this case as a class action on behalf of all Marine Corps personnel stationed at the combat-ready Marine Corps Air Station at Iwakuni, Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.596" offset="401742">Here as in Brown v. Glines, respondents sought declaratory and injunctive relief against military regulations that require the prior approval of the base commander before petitions may be distributed on base, and here as in Brown v. Glines, the Court of Appeals held that the regulations are invalid under 10USC 1034, as applied to the on-base distribution of petitions to members of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.576" offset="505710">The Court of Appeals limited its holding both to the statutory issue and to the Iwakuni Base itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.611" offset="533817">It did not reach any constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.754" offset="554402">I have already made two points about the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.633" offset="569866">First, that it was designed to protect private individual communications rather than group petitioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.006" offset="595362">We think the legislative history on that is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.809" offset="610617">Second, even if group petitioning were communication within the meaning of the statute, the Navy and Air Force regulations do not restrict the communication of such petitions to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.876" offset="662862">The military's unwillingness to open military facilities to public activities traditionally prohibited is not a restriction on the communication of the petition itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.539" offset="709569">If the Court agrees with either of those submissions, it need not reach the third issue under the statute which I will discuss at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.804" offset="746559">Assuming for the purposes of discussion that the regulations in some sense restrict the communication of petitions to Congress, the statute allows restrictions imposed under regulations that are necessary to the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.225" offset="808312">The only legislative history concerning this particular language in the statutes refers, of course, to individual communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.018" offset="839450">Congressman Vinson stated that the statute lets any serviceman "write his Congressman on any subject if it does not violate the law or if it does not deal with some secret matter."</text>
            <text syncTime="197.068" offset="891695">Well, we concede that it is difficult to know what restrictions Congress thought the words in the statute might permit for group petitioning, and that is because Congress didn't think the statute applied to this group petitioning activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.014" offset="947388">But the Court of Appeals both here and in the Glines case recognized that the regulatory objective of insuring a discipline prepared military force is essential to national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.153" offset="995976">The courts held, however, that the prior approval requirement is necessary to achieve this objective only in a combat zone, and that outside a combat zone post-distribution punishment is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.156" offset="1055953">The implication of the court's reasoning as we see it is that the need for troops to be fully prepared for immediate action is materially less outside a combat zone than within one.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.177" offset="1100048">But the problem with that reasoning is that as a practical matter it is unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.536" offset="1121468">The military cannot know today and doesn't know today where troops stationed at the strategic air base in Guam involved in the Glines case or at the combat ready marine station in Japan involved in this case, where those troops may be called upon to serve tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.431" offset="1189073">It is simply admonistic to suggest in an age of jets and missiles that only troops in a combat zone must be fully prepared for immediate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.962" offset="1231182">Certainly the court's reasoning is incorrect as applied to the advanced defense bases involved in these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.456" offset="1269217">General Brown said in his affidavit that was filed in the Huff case that an effective military force cannot be prepared only on the eve of battle or during combat.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.133" offset="1311953">He testified that the highest standards of discipline and morale are essential for readiness as well as for combat itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.961" offset="1343195">Well, there wasn't any contrary evidence, expert or otherwise, in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.678" offset="1362108">But the Court of Appeals simply disagreed with the military assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.721" offset="1382275">It's difficult, we concede that it's difficult to know with certainty what is necessary in any particular situation to insure military preparedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.429" offset="1421040">As Judge Leventhal said in an analogous context, in Culver v. Secretary of Air Force, however, "Whereas in this case the military determination is based on reasoned policy rather than on capriciousness, it should be sustained."</text>
            <text syncTime="344.791" offset="1482585">And we think that's especially so under a statute in which Congress never thought would apply to group petitioning activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.971" offset="1519261">If there are no questions, I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.037" offset="2803545">The issue in the Huff case, unlike the Glines case, is simply a statutory issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.167" offset="2824025">The question is whether certain Marine and Navy regulations require prior command approval for circulation of petitions to Congress by service personnel on base overseas violate 10 U.S. Code Section 1034.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.331" offset="2876688">Our position, as summarized, is first, that Section 1034 includes within its scope both individual and collective petition activities, and that secondly, the regulations under attack here are not necessary to our national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.166" offset="2932067">I think it's important to note first that there are four regulations at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.692" offset="2946173">There is a First Marine Aircraft Wing Order, a Marine Corps Air Station Order, Fleet Marine Force Specific Order, and a Commander-in-Chief Pacific Fleet Instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.259" offset="2992358">These four regulations cover the entire Western Pacific for both Marines and Navy, including Hawaii, the fleet in those waters and any of those ships that are in port in the western United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.411" offset="3053066">In pertinent part they read as follows "No personnel will originate, sign, distribute, or promulgate petitions anywhere within a foreign country, irrespective of uniform or duty status, unless prior command approval is obtained."</text>
            <text syncTime="752.009" offset="3111372">In other words, these cover all petitioning activities whether on base, off base, on duty, off duty, in uniform or out of uniform.</text>

            <text syncTime="953.400" offset="3916988">However, we believe that if you look at the word "communication," you take its ordinary meaning, it means petitioning.</text>

            <text syncTime="962.902" offset="3955022">In 1325.6 they show this statute as being a basis for the right to petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.573" offset="3993684">At the time of the enactment of the statute here, Article 1246, which was one of the concerns, a Navy regulation was entitled Communications to the Congress, and that article included within its terms the right to petition, so that it seems clear that both in terms of an ordinary meaning, in terms of DOD interpretation, and in terms of the contemporary interpretation today, the word "communication" includes within it petitioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.756" offset="4126386">It is also clear that contrary to the government's position there is a direct conflict between the regulations in this case and the statute, unlike in the Glines case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.937" offset="4187094">The statute says that there shall be no restriction, there shall be no prior review, and the regulation here says that no personnel will originate, sign, distribute, or promulgate petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.296" offset="4232547">In other words, an individual member, before he sits down and sends that letter and signs that letter, has to get prior command approval.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.437" offset="4497115">And I think that unlike the Air Force regulation before you, in Glines, which specifically speaks to group petitioning activities as requiring prior command approval, the regulation here does not have any exception of that nature, that there is an inconsistency here, a conflict here between the regulation and the statute, which is not present in the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.299" offset="4604531">Furthermore it is our contention that the statute encompasses, when we say petitioning, that it encompasses both individual and collective petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.164" offset="4632012">The language itself is not limiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.206" offset="4640162">There are no restrictions as to what an individual person may do or the type of activity in terms of an individual or collective petition, and there is no requirement in the wording of the individual action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.251" offset="4688332">The intent was clear, and that was to eliminate prior command review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.233" offset="4704319">And the court below found that there was no indication that the outer limit was an individual petition, and the court in Allen v. Monger, which is pending before this Court, also looked at the amendment changes to the statute, the historical context, and concluded similarly that the scope of 1034 was beyond an individual letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.696" offset="4798151">We also believe that the statute must be interpreted as found by the court below in the light of the long and cherished tradition in this country of the right to petition Congress for redress of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.463" offset="4845275">The government, we believe, totally ignores this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.378" offset="4860844">The decisions of this Court have consistently upheld the right to petition, consistently inveighed against prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.673" offset="4890102">And it is our contention that if this statute is to be properly interpreted, it must be interpreted in this light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.612" offset="4925837">The application of the regulations in this case shows that 1034 must be interpreted to include individual and collective petitioning, and that these protections are needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.831" offset="4974738">There are four separate fact situations that we would like to refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.715" offset="4990203">First, respondent Huff requested the commander of the First Marine Aircraft Wing to circulate a petition to Senator Cranston involving the use of military in labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.969" offset="5031267">He wanted to circulate that in the barracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.669" offset="5042030">He was going to circulate it out of uniform, off duty, no use of government materials, he wouldn't interfere with military personnel on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.231" offset="5072332">In fact, all requests in this case were accompanied by similar language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.490" offset="5089364">Three weeks later that request was denied, the commander saying the petition contained gross misstatements, implications of law as fact, as well as impugning by innuendo the motives and conduct of the commander-in-chief of the armed forces in the exercise of his constitutional responsibilities."</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.493" offset="5153311">To authorize permission to circulate such grossly erroneous and misleading commentary would be contrary to my responsibility as a colander to maintain good order and discipline and afford proper guidance to the men under my command."</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.400" offset="5200959">It's clear from this denial that in fact the commanding officer was denying this request on the basis of the content.</text>

            <text syncTime="1372.244" offset="5592377">The second fact situation was, the Respondent Falatine requested permission to circulate a petition to Congressperson Dellums in support of amnesty, and on the same day that the Huff petition was denied, the commanding officer denied that petition under the same regulation with the exact same reason not even within the terms of the regulation that he was supposedly acting under.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.212" offset="5692270">Again, a clear disagreement of the content of what was being distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.471" offset="5709302">Similarly, respondent Gabrielson requested permission to distribute a letter to Senator Fulbright concerning U.S. support for the Government of South Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.573" offset="5741693">He requested permission to distribute this in the barracks and around the barracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.577" offset="5757680">It was granted with regard to outside the barracks, not inside, and he was told that he couldn't argue or debate while distributing this letter, and no reasons were given for these restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.573" offset="5817657">The fourth example, which I think epitomizes this case, Huff and Falatine separately requested the First Marine Aircraft Wing commander to leaflet the base with a leaflet entitled, "We Hold These Truths To Be Self-evident, But Do The Brass?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.651" offset="5873977">It included the Declaration of Independence, the First Amendment, and their commentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.980" offset="5891323">The commanding officer denied Falatine's request, stating that the introductory paragraph is by transparent implication disrespectful and contemptuous of all your superior officers, noncommissioned officers, civilians and the like, and he would consider the distribution a clear hazard to discipline and morale within the First Marine Aircraft Wing, yet on that very same day that same commanding officer permitted Huff to distribute that leaflet.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.295" offset="10448541">Well, we think it should be construed in light of its legislative history, and the legislative history, as I have gone through and I have heard no rebuttal, focuses completely on the individual communications to members of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.340" offset="10512697">And there was, as I have also mentioned before, another statute that Congress could have used as a model if it had intended to apply the statute to petitioning activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.597" offset="10661804">I think the question of whether the statute would be applicable there is a question that we haven't addressed and I am not sure what the answer would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.338" offset="10696704">The legislative history definitely focuses on the individual, the communication of an individual serviceman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.389" offset="10728887">But I think the more important point, in response to your question, is that the regulation doesn't restrict the communication or that kind of a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.625" offset="10769847">So even if the statute were applied there, it wouldn't have any bearing on the disposition of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.739" offset="10798373">The respondents also mentioned that the regulation has been misapplied on some occasions and we conceded that, but the misapplication of the regulation doesn't make it patently invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.531" offset="10845497">And we don't know how many rightful denials they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.045" offset="10855528">Those haven't been litigated and they aren't here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.544" offset="10869530">I think, as in Parker v. Levy, the regulation, like the statute in Parker v. Levy, the regulation has a substantial core context in which it clearly applies and should not be held patently invalid.</text>
