            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">In the Kissinger case, Henry Kissinger served in the Nixon and Ford administrations from January of 1969 through January of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.174" offset="64679">During those years, he served first as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and later a Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.143" offset="96549">Throughout this period of government service, Kissinger's secretaries monitored his telephone calls and summaries of transcripts of the conversations were prepared and retained in his personal files at the State Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.999" offset="159974">In October of 1976 while still Secretary of State, Kissinger removed the telephone notes from his office in the State Department without first seeking the approval of federal authorities responsible for the maintenance and disposal of federal records.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.786" offset="227056">Subsequently Kissinger entered into agreements with the Library of Congress dating his private papers including his collection of telephone notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.555" offset="266136">The agreements restrict public access to the collection for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.406" offset="289541">Before Kissinger ended his tenure as Secretary of State, three separate Freedom of Information Acts were filed with the State Department seeking access to the transcripts of telephone conversations made by Kissinger while acting either as Assistant for National Security Affairs and/or Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.014" offset="380029">All three requests were denied by the State Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.193" offset="396748">The first of these request filed by William Safire sought access to conversations transcribed while Kissinger was serving as Assistant to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.761" offset="438962">This request was denied on the grounds that the requested telephone notes were White House records excluded from FOIA coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.430" offset="477623">The other two requests were denied because they were filed with the State Department after Kissinger had removed the notes from the State Department office.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.271" offset="513045">The individuals and groups whose FOIA request had been denied filed actions in federal courts seeking a judicial order requiring the library to return the telephone notes to the State Department with directions to process them for disclosure under the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.174" offset="588696">The plaintiffs named Kissinger, the Library of Congress, the Secretary of State and the Department of State as defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.506" offset="621923">On summary judgment, the District Court ruled that the plaintiff should have access to the telephone notes transcribed while Kissinger was Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.824" offset="659226">The District order of premises finding as conclusion that the telephone notes were agency records as defined in FOIA accessible under that Act and that Kissinger had wrongfully removed those records by not obtaining the required approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.794" offset="723174">The Court therefore held that equitable relief was appropriate under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.317" offset="741251">The Court entered an order denying plaintiff's request however for conversations transcribed while Kissinger was Special Assistant to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.307" offset="781166">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the District Court and the parties filed cross-petition for certiorari in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.192" offset="820767">Today, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.611" offset="834351">First, we reverse the order requiring the return of the telephone notes made while Kissinger was Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.805" offset="863190">The Freedom of Information Act explicitly approved -- provides the federal courts are only authorized to order disclosure of requested materials when an agency has improperly withheld agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.727" offset="918883">We hold today that the State Department has not withheld any documents from the plaintiffs within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.192" offset="948767">At the time of the two requests, the agency had neither the custody or control necessary to enable it to withhold as Congress used that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.914" offset="995579">We affirm the Court of Appeals however in its judgment denying access to telephone notes transcribed while Kissinger served Assistant to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.754" offset="1034971">The Act provides that records of the Executive Officer of the President are not available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.701" offset="1066736">We conclude that the Court of Appeals and District Court properly characterized the Safire request as seeking access only to White House records excluded from the Act's coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.656" offset="1114593">Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Stevens have filed separate opinions concurring and dissenting in the judgment of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.604" offset="1146358">Mr. Justice Marshall did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.285" offset="1169136">Mr. Justice Blackmun did not participate in the decision of this case.</text>
