            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear arguments first this morning in O'Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.427" offset="149086">Mr. Watkins, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman J. Watkins</label>
            <text syncTime="16.564" offset="169671">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.979" offset="183254">Skilled nursing home services are publicly funded under both Title 18 and Title 19 of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.901" offset="215019">Title 18, commonly referred to as Medicare, sets forth the standards and conditions which skilled nursing homes must meet whether or not they participate in Title 18 or Title 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.971" offset="263293">The standards are set forth in Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.741" offset="274369">Title 18, Medicare, is primarily administered by the Federal Government, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.470" offset="297253">Title 19, on the other hand, is primarily administered by the states that participate in Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.134" offset="323897">In this case, Pennsylvania's Department of Health is the responsible agency for determining whether or not Title 18 and Title 19 providers of skilled nursing care meet the conditions and standards which the statute and regulations require of nursing homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.454" offset="397145">The federal role in this process is basically one of oversight; however, with respect to Title 18 providers in particular, the Federal Government retains and often exercises the independent authority to survey the facilities and make an independent judgment as to whether or not they meet the requirements established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.855" offset="478751">The survey function is performed annually and generally involves a survey by professionals in the field to determine whether or not the facility meets all of the very specific conditions of participation in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.727" offset="538311">Town Court, the respondent facility in this case, is a dual provider; that is, a participant in both Title 18 and Title 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.754" offset="582405">As such, the facility had dual responsibilities to both the Federal Government and the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.587" offset="609677">Since 1967 Town Court has participated in this role and has had a checkered history with respect to compliance with the statutory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.646" offset="653981">From 1967 to '73, the lower court acknowledged that Town Court's participation in the program was basically conditioned upon a number of plans of corrections that have been accepted by the governments to allow them to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.523" offset="717511">In 1974 the State of Pennsylvania determined that Town Court was so substantially out of compliance that it recommended that the facility be terminated, and it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.661" offset="758053">It was readmitted after successive applications in 1976; however, later that year a grand jury was impaneled and returned indictments against the facility and its management with respect to care.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.246" offset="816358">That prompted the Federal Government to conduct an independent survey of the facility, whereupon HEW found substantial non-compliance with the statutory requirements and requested Pennsylvania to conduct its own survey of the facility, which was performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.818" offset="878634">After successive conferences and negotiations and, indeed, surveys of the facility, Pennsylvania ultimately recommended to the Secretary of HEW that the facility be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.180" offset="920116">Effective June 20, 1977, the facility was terminated, having been given 30 days prior notice by both the United States and the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.065" offset="963584">Indeed, seven major conditions prompted the action by the governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.134" offset="983960">These conditions are set forth in the appendix at page 295A, and the statutory references are included there.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.069" offset="1027636">But they run the gamut from medical services to administrative responsibility being taken by the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.458" offset="1061177">Town Court is provided with a series of administrative reviews post-termination, which it began to exercise after the action by the governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.069" offset="1099630">However, before those procedures could be exhausted, this action was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.258" offset="1124394">Town Court joined by six individual residents of the facility sued both the Secretary of HEW and the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, charging that it was a violation of its, the facility's, due process rights and its patients' due process rights for the facility to be terminated without prior notice and hearing; indeed without a prior evidentiary hearing be provided to the facility and independently to the patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.043" offset="1251558">After several hearings the District Court ruled against Town Court and against the patients, finding that the statutory procedures were sufficient for the facility and that the patients were entitled to no pre-termination hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.201" offset="1320208">The patients and the facility appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.118" offset="1331806">The Secretary of HEW cross-appealed because the District Court also ordered that the governments continue to make Medicare and Medicaid payments to Town Court.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="317.812" offset="1374647">And your client's predecessor did not appeal?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman J. Watkins</label>
            <text syncTime="321.001" offset="1387395">That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.173" offset="1396067">The view taken by my client's predecessor was, with respect to the funding order, which was the only adverse order, that our fate rested with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.618" offset="1433893">If the Federal Government was successful on its appeal, rightly or wrongly, my client's predecessor assumed that its obligation would also fall by the wayside.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.275" offset="1480495">The Court of Appeals specifically took issue with that and that's a question, I think, that is really not pertinent to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.033" offset="1523545">On the merits --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="355.713" offset="1526262">But it is a question that remains here, as to whether or not we have jurisdiction of your petition?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman J. Watkins</label>
            <text syncTime="361.215" offset="1548204">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.403" offset="1553011">We have addressed that question in our reply brief, the Solicitor General has addressed it in both his reply and opening briefs, and briefly, it's our position that the arguments which are being advanced here on the merits were advanced properly to the Court of Appeals, were decided by the Court of Appeals; indeed, the Court of Appeals took the position that it was deciding the case on behalf or against both Pennsylvania and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.250" offset="1660322">Pennsylvania as an appellee in the Court of Appeals on the issue of primary importance is clearly, under our view, entitled to seek review of an adverse ruling, which she suffered in the Court of Appeals in this Court.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="406.168" offset="1728031">And the ruling of the Court of Appeals was in favor of the government, wasn't it, of the United States?</text>

            <text syncTime="410.983" offset="1747257">Well, it's a little confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.217" offset="1752273">The ruling on the merits was against both the United States and Pennsylvania, basically holding that the patients had a due process right.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.139" offset="1783933">It would seem to follow than that the funding order would have to be reversed but my reading of the opinion indicates that the funding order was not reversed, and I think it's somewhat inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.683" offset="1830118">We pointed that out.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.307" offset="2056652">How about in the Court of Appeals?</text>
            <text syncTime="489.707" offset="2062190">Did they take a position with respect to whether or not the patients have standing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="494.528" stopTime="767.439">
            <label>Mr. Norman J. Watkins</label>
            <text syncTime="494.528" offset="2081520">Yes, they took a position in support of the patients, but the primary thrust of their assertion, and they were independently represented, was that Town Court itself had this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.520" offset="2121435">Thus if they were successful, the patients' interests were really of no consequence to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.109" offset="2143796">But they did not seek review of the adverse ruling that they suffered in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.597" offset="2173785">The Court of Appeals issued two opinions, first as I mentioned, ruling that Town Court was adequately protected by the procedures set forth in the statute and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.487" offset="2209311">The second, departing, in my view, from at least two other circuit courts, held that the patients, contrary to the facility, were entitled to pre-termination -- and when I refer to termination, I mean termination of the facility -- pre-termination evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.929" offset="2283081">The court's rationale is not found in the opinion but rather in a companion case decided the same say, Klein v. Califano.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.636" offset="2325922">In that opinion, the court recognized, indeed acknowledged and conceded, that Title 19 does not specifically guarantee -- or Title 18, for that matter -- does not specifically guarantee any rights to the patients, or indeed any role for the patients in the determination of whether or not a particular nursing home provider is qualified under the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.999" offset="2423411">However, the court looked to three distinct provisions and inferred from those provisions that as a matter of policy and in view of the grave consequences that it perceived in the decision to terminate that the statute should be construed so as to protect this, quote, "property interest,".</text>
            <text syncTime="606.504" offset="2529364">Further articulation of this position was given by Judge Adams in his concurring opinion which may well be, as the Solicitor General points out, the majority opinion in this case, because it was joined in by two members of the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.668" offset="2574085">But Judge Adams further expounded on this and noted that because of the prevalence of social welfare programs in today's society and because of these provisions in the statute, which I will get to, he perceived a landscape with three distinct points on it that created a property interest, indeed, quote, "a new type of property interest," unquote, that we all should be alert to.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.789" offset="2686516">With these rationales in hand the Court of Appeals then determined that the patients were indeed entitled to a pre-termination evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.657" offset="2726013">As we point out, each of these provisions has no bearing whatsoever on the question and provides no basis for the ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.781" offset="2758510">The fact of the matter is that the recipients of skilled nursing home care are only entitled to receive skilled nursing home care from a qualified skilled nursing home.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.927" offset="2799052">Indeed, if a nursing home does not meet the conditions of participation, it's not a skilled nursing home under Title 19 and 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.371" offset="2828831">The Court of Appeals overlooked this and found that the freedom of choice provision and the transfer limitations all created an aura of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.035" offset="2867493">We submit that it is not for the judiciary to lightly overlook the clear intent of Congress that the relationships between the patients and the government and the contractors and the government be distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.818" offset="2918693">The relationship between the contractor and the government is one which is specifically detailed in the statute and does not encompass any role whatsoever for the patients in determining the eligibility of the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.304" offset="2964564">Similarly, the contractor has no role in determining the eligibility of the patients, and that is the way Congress envisioned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.401" offset="2996955">As Judge Friendly said, common sense suggests that there must be some floor below which no hearing of any sort is required, and I suggest that the Court of Appeals has dipped below that floor in failing to recognized that the entire thrust of Title 19 depends upon the qualifications of both the provider and the recipient, and here the Court of Appeals is granting a recipient a role in determining the qualifications of a provider, which Congress never envisioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.462" offset="3137181">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.926" offset="4551032">What the Court of Appeals held in substance was that because the decision to terminate a nursing home in the program has a significant effect on the patients' exercise of their statutory rights, the decision therefore constituted in some way a deprivation of the patients' statutory rights and there-for a deprivation of their property interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.564" offset="4649671">Accordingly the Court of Appeals concluded that the patients have a right under the due process clause to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the merits of the decision to terminate the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.944" offset="4699199">It's our basic submission that this theory of the due process clause is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.047" offset="4719574">It would mean that government agencies would have to provide notice and hearings in an almost infinite number of situations in which governmental action affects the exercise of people's statutory or constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.752" offset="4782373">To take the theory to its logical conclusion, it would mean that if the government cancelled a defense contract, it would have to provide hearings to all of the defense contractor's employees who might be affected by that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.665" offset="4833991">To take an example that's perhaps more pertinent in this context, suppose that a state medical licensing board sought to delicense a doctor on the grounds that he was professionally incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.562" offset="4885608">Under the Court of Appeals theory, not only the doctor but all of his Medicaid patients would have a constitutional right to be heard on the question of the doctor's qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.189" offset="4940152">These and other examples, we submit, are no different in principle from this case, and I think it's interesting that the respondent patients have not responded, at least in their briefs, to the obvious implication of their position to innumerable other governmental decisions on in an alix context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.493" offset="5021341">The fact that the Court of Appeals decision would have far-reaching implications, of course, does not necessarily mean that it was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.108" offset="5047777">Indeed, this Court has never directly faced the kind of claim of derivative constitutional rights that the patients are asserting in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.124" offset="5095842">Our contention that the Court of Appeals was wrong is based on the basic proposition that this Court's decisions reflect, that the procedural protections of the due process clause must be confined by some limiting principles, that government could hardly function if it had to provide notice and evidentiary hearings to all persons affected by governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.254" offset="5192391">As this Court has said many times, the relevant question concerns the nature and not the weight of the interest that is affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.640" offset="5225932">And it is our submission that in considering the nature of the interest that is affected, courts must also identify whose rights are being affected, whose rights are being primarily affected by the governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.920" offset="5283088">In this case, the termination decision is directed primarily against the nursing home, and no one disputes that the nursing home has a statutory right and a constitutional property interest that is affected, and therefore a right to some kind of notice and opportunity to be heard in the merits of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.769" offset="5370441">It is our submission that so long as the person whose rights are primarily affected by governmental action is given an opportunity to contest that action and a notice of the action, the due process clause does not require hearings on the same decision for other persons whose rights are indirectly affected by that action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.418" offset="5605021">Well, the harm is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.578" offset="5613693">Let us assume, at least for the sake of argument, that a particular nursing home is in substantial noncompliance with the statutory standards and requirements, and thus poses a genuine threat to the health and safety of the patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.016" offset="5675447">The most effective sanction that the regulatory agencies have for either inducing compliance by the home or for protecting the patients is to terminate the home's participation in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.049" offset="5723617">If agencies could not exercise their right until they gave hearings to all of the patients in the home, the effectiveness of that sanction would be largely nullified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.811" offset="5770637">The credibility of the sanction would largely evaporate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.529" offset="5793520">I cannot put it better than the Court of Appeals to the 9th Circuit in rejecting a similar claim with respect to a claim by patients of a veterans hospital in a case we discussed in our brief Moore v. Johnson - Referring to the impact of the decision on patients of a decision to close certain facilities, the court said "Similar burdens always attend the extensive distribution of benefits by government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.175" offset="5892054">Inescapably, few get exactly what they want while most, it is usually assumed, get more than what they would have otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.724" offset="5918281">All would get less if invariably the complaints of the many required elaborate hearings with all the trappings that only lawyers and judges can fully appreciate."</text>

            <text syncTime="1523.395" offset="6196955">The petitioner -- I am referring to the Secretary of the Department of Welfare -- filed no appeal or cross-appeal from that injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.154" offset="6268008">Their appeal concerned Town Court under Title 18.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.809" offset="6650650">At this point nothing is before the court because during the course of the hearing, when the court was hearing evidence on our request for injunctive relief, an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals in the interruption of the evidence at that time, and I will refer to that in just a moment, sir, because that's what the Court of Appeals had in mind when it remanded the case to the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.443" offset="6753155">It left to the lower court, when it remanded the case of the patients, the procedures, and I use their language, in the case which has been interrupted by the appeal from the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.458" offset="6805191">I interpret that to mean that completion of the case before the lower court was then in order, and depending on how the court held concerning whether there was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, then the matter would again go back to the Court of Appeals and possibly to this Court that the parties weren't satisfied with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.527" offset="6897455">Petitioner again took no appeal nor position and they come before this Court and seek review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.580" offset="6949700">The remanding of the case to the lower court for completion? Obviously he's not appealing that or reviewing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.843" offset="6982719">Or does she rely on the issue raised by HEW?</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.258" offset="7000377">If she does, that issue concerns Town Court under Title 18, Medicare, and did not involve the patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.527" offset="7037471">It was decided in favor of HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.269" offset="7052413">The issue was put to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.289" offset="7060564">No other issue remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.229" offset="7076237">Our argument is that the petitioner's obligation to the patients that we represent arises under Pennsylvania statutory law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.349" offset="7112808">This was not questioned by the petitioner before the Court of Appeals, and the court remarked about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.183" offset="7140080">They stated, "Plaintiff has not cross appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.833" offset="7154709">The propriety of the order entered against her is not before us."</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.528" offset="7181458">I say to this Court that HEW had its issue decided</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.096" offset="7199744">.HEW cannot be involved in a suit by the patients against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania under our statutory law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.910" offset="13274990">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.564" offset="13289618">Several matters I would like to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.506" offset="13301426">First, the question of whether or not the petitioner is properly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.224" offset="13324309">Respondent makes apparently two claims in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.559" offset="13337579">The first is, as I understand it, that the order that his proceedings in the District Court were interrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.011" offset="13363388">I assume he is suggesting that the order of the District Court was not appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.384" offset="13380942">He failed to point out that he appealed from that order, and it is indeed that appeal that brings the petitioner to this Court, because as we have pointed out, we participated as appellee in the Court of Appeals, responding to his appeal on the issue of primary importance, that being the patients' due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.537" offset="13469550">Secondly, he concedes that if HEW is properly here, then of course plenary review may be granted over the question presented in the certiorari petition, but he argues that HEW is not properly here because they never sued HEW on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.444" offset="13553142">I ask the Court to look at the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.378" offset="13564844">The prayer for relief very specifically runs against both HEW and Pennsylvania, and well it should, because HEW provides over half of the funding for the Medicaide patients which my learned opponent is representing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.230" offset="13728266">Indeed, it would have to be against HEW because, as I said, they provide over half of the funds that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.489" offset="13753344">So that the fact that there are no Medicare patients is of little consequence, and is easily explained -- easily explains why HEW was sued by these Medicaide patients, because HEW has an extremely large role in the administration of Medicaide, and without them as a defendant here, the relief could not have been complete.</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.163" offset="13928051">He has yet to point to a provision in Pennsylvania law that requires a hearing for these patients before their Medicaide certification -- before the nursing home certification is terminated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.987" offset="13987297">His point is that the failure of -- any failure to provide for a hearing for the patients is the violation of the Federal Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3481.522" offset="14029511">That is what I assumed he was arguing until this morning, when I believe that he argued that it was net federal law that he was concerned about; he was concerned about provisions of state law which, if they existed, of course, would be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.680" offset="14090115">The fact of the matter is he has pointed to none; there are none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.667" offset="14102026">We have supplied the Court with a copy of the precise contract which was utilized between the State of Pennsylvania and Town Court Nursing Center which in the clearest of terms points out that the contract is terminable forthwith should the facility fall out of compliance with federal and state regulations governing the operation of such facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.451" offset="14209128">Finally, I should point out that throughout the proceedings, the state law questions never surface from the respondents, never have the patients asserted that Pennsylvania was breaching its own law by terminating the facility, and indeed, the first mention of any such, the first allusion to this is in this Court, and as I pointed out, no specific provisions were pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.445" offset="14313200">Indeed, they couldn't be because they don't exist.</text>
