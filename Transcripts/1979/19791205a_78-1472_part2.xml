            <label>Mr. William H. Alsup</label>
            <text syncTime="21.457" offset="189210">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.071" offset="207705">As I was saying before the recess, the regulations promulgated in 1974 provided for basically three types of hearings - the public legislative-type hearing, the adjudicatory hearing and the procedure by which legal objections could be determined by general counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.844" offset="294745">The regulations also imposed threshold requirements for each of these type hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.043" offset="323584">The public legislative-type hearing would only be held if, after giving public notice of what the EPA intended to do, the Regional Administrator determined that there was significant public interest in the proposed action.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.309" offset="400593">The adjudicatory hearing would be held only if someone presented a question -- not just someone, but an interested party presented a request for an adjudicatory hearing that set forth a material issue of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.805" offset="462555">And the regulations were quite specific on that, they said the request to be denied, and must be denied, if no such requests presenting a material issue of fact were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.103" offset="507800">And then finally the only requirement for getting a legal determination was that someone submit a request stating an objection based on legal grounds to proposed course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.625" offset="557850">In the present case, when the 1975 permit was issued -- on August 18 of 1975 -- the EPA announced its proposed action of issuing the permit to the City of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.344" offset="616782">It gave notice -- public notice -- held a public hearing and then issued a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.777" offset="650428">That is the permit that I described a moment ago containing the compliance schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.574" offset="673625">No one at that time sought review under section 509 of the Act to have that action set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.920" offset="707062">Similarly, when that permit expired by its own terms in early 1977, the agency went through that same procedure - held a public hearing, received comments at that hearing, extended the permit for six months through June 30, 1977 with no other modification other than simply extending the expiration date of the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.990" offset="827329">Once again, no one challenged that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.005" offset="847391">Then, on April 27, 1977, EPA announced, and this was looking forward to the June 30 deadline when the permit would expire again, EPA announced that it proposed to extend the permit once again, this time to December 17 of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.595" offset="921788">The agency made this announcement by publishing in the Los Angeles Times on April 27 a statement saying what it proposed to do, saying that requests -- invited the public to file requests for the public-type hearing and stated that one would be held if there were significant public interest in the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.896" offset="1006947">And, in addition, stated that there would also be an opportunity under the regulations for requests for an adjudicatory hearing.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="234.113" offset="1039862">Mr. Alsup, could I interrupt there, because I have some difficulty, frankly, understanding the City of Los Angeles' position in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.527" offset="1077478">What did you do, just extend the date by which the changes had to be made, the sludge out and the improvement on the liquid?</text>
            <text syncTime="251.610" offset="1109765">Is that all that happened, it gave Los Angeles more time to comply?</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Alsup</label>
            <text syncTime="255.153" offset="1123976">The action that was taken on both occasions was really to extend the expiration date of the permit itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.748" offset="1154382">It did not not modify in any the compliance schedule deadline dates that were in the original permit in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.023" offset="1191476">Now, it is true that Los Angeles believes that EPA somehow acquiesced in the State schedule for compliance which was extended by the State, we believe that Los Angeles is in error on that and that EPA never acquiesced in and never modified its own compliance schedule to achieve the so-called ultimate sludge out.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="299.819" offset="1302653">I quite really haven't been able to understand how just merely extending the termination date of the permit, how could that adversely affect the City of Los Angeles in any way?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_alsup" startTime="311.011" stopTime="335.434">
            <label>Mr. William H. Alsup</label>
            <text syncTime="311.011" offset="1347375">Well, I don't think it would, in one sense; and, that is because by law the city must have one of these permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.243" offset="1384364">Otherwise, they have to discontinue discharging altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.932" offset="1399097">So, in a sense, they are really not complaining about the existence of the permit but rather the conditions, the compliance schedule that was imposed in that permit.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="335.434" stopTime="342.142">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="335.434" offset="1445073">They are saying that the Federal permit should have been modified to follow the State schedule.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_alsup" startTime="342.142" stopTime="376.983">
            <label>Mr. William H. Alsup</label>
            <text syncTime="342.142" offset="1471927">I actually think they are saying much more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.318" offset="1480600">Their basic position seems to be as does BLF's and Kilroy's that the compliance schedule should be eliminated altogether because there is no environmental harm in pumping that sludge into the ocean; and that there should be no compliance schedule at all but rather what EPA should do is set some maximum effluent level that could be perpetually achieved by the city by continuing to pump forever into the ocean.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="376.983" offset="1611316">That is a position they could have taken back in -- when the original August 18, '75 permit was issued, isn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Alsup</label>
            <text syncTime="389.999" offset="1663352">That is correct.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="390.880" stopTime="392.186">

            <label>Mr. William H. Alsup</label>
            <text syncTime="392.186" offset="1672129">And I have to say I don't think they took that position even in the extension that occurred in June of 1977, although they had taken that position in correspondence with the agency concerning a grant to the city to assist it in its waste water treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.388" offset="1764916">Well, again, no one commented on this April 27 notice, no one requested a public legislative-type hearing; even the City of Los Angeles, and a personal copy was mailed to them of this proposed action.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.261" offset="1836387">And so on June 2, 1977 the Regional Administrator determined to go ahead and extend the permit with the compliance schedules intact as before.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.777" offset="1882467">Now, that action triggered the ten-day period within which someone could file a request for an adjudicatory hearing and on June -- that is under the regulations -- and on June 13, Mr. Kilroy did; he filed it, being represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.800" offset="1966582">As I mentioned though, the regulations require that any such requests set forth a material issue of fact if you want to have a trial-type hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.987" offset="1999287">That is section 125.36(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="477.155" offset="2012035">The Regional Administrator looked at the request and concluded that it only raised legal issues and so advised Pacific Legal Foundation and said "You don't raise factual issues, you raise legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.354" offset="2064802">I am referring your legal issues to our third procedure, that is the general counsel will now determine the validity of your legal objections."</text>
            <text syncTime="499.328" offset="2100642">And the Pacific Legal Foundation on behalf of Kilroy was asked to file a brief on those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.259" offset="2124361">And Pacific Legal Foundation did and said, "These are the issues that we plan to raise and we meant to raise; and it is clear from that brief which is in the record that those were not factual issues, those were purely legal issues."</text>
            <text syncTime="518.246" offset="2176397">Now, the general counsel than ruled against BLF, and that should have been the end of the case, in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.625" offset="2197922">However, it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.141" offset="2207953">Pacific Legal Foundation, Kilroy, the City of Los Angeles, and now the City of Torrance, which is a neighbor to Los Angeles, filed petitions for review under section 509 in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.831" offset="2270647">The Court of Appeals ruled against EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.256" offset="2280364">It didn't question the general counsel's treatment of the legal issues, which were the only issues ever tendered to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.085" offset="2303666">That somehow never was addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.183" offset="2316100">Rather, the Court of Appeals set aside the sludge out schedule, that is the one that applies to that seven-mile pipe, and said "You can't enforce that any more because you, EPA, did not provide an adjudicatory hearing."</text>

            <text syncTime="570.081" offset="2383705">There were many arguments urged and I think it is fair to say that the drift of that argument was probably presented to the Ninth Circuit, not specifically though, but I think that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.541" offset="2441488">And our position on that was Well, no request setting forth any material issue of fact was filed with the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.655" offset="2461968">And that is why we didn't hold an adjudicatory hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.826" offset="2474715">And here is the interesting way that the Ninth Circuit got around that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.850" offset="2486732">They said, the Ninth Circuit said "Well, this opportunity for public hearing contemplates that you must routinely hold an adjudicatory hearing even if no one requests one, unless the EPA is prepared to show on judicial review that its decision rests upon facts about which there could be no plausible factual dispute."</text>
            <text syncTime="625.634" offset="2605955">This is a pretty onerous burden because it would permit -- and I would like to explain later -- a complete stranger to the proceedings to walk into the Ninth Circuit and say, "They didn't hold an adjudicatory hearing and I have now identified a factual issue that I think is in dispute."</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Alsup</label>
            <text syncTime="740.148" offset="3063933">The Ninth Circuit did not actually say that but we think that is the practical implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.124" offset="3087862">In our view, if it would be permissible -- if the Ninth Circuit might say, "Well of course if that happened you wouldn't have to hold a hearing if no one showed up."</text>
            <text syncTime="753.277" offset="3116492">But our response to that is - Well, if that is true, then why should we be required to hold a hearing at all if no one bothers to even request one?</text>
            <text syncTime="763.687" offset="3158079">We don't think that those are substantially greater burdens to place on the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.440" offset="3185142">Well, our basic disagreement with the Ninth Circuit's holding is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.742" offset="3202382">First of all, the phrase "opportunity for public hearing" does not prohibit the agency from imposing reasonable threshold requirements on the availability of a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.757" offset="3250448">And barring at the threshold those people who don't satisfy those threshold requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.026" offset="3275525">This was the holding of the court in the Storer case and the Weinberger v. Hynson case and in the Kleppe case, among others.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.957" offset="3327248">For example, in the Storer case the FCC issued a rule, the statute there said anyone could have a hearing on their license; it seemed to be mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.661" offset="3362043">But in fact the Court said "No, the FCC can say we are not going to issue a license to someone who already owns more than X number of radio stations, so that those people would just be barred at the threshold."</text>
            <text syncTime="829.026" offset="3419512">And the Court went further to say that the FCC would entertain waivers of that policy; but it would only entertain waivers and they still wouldn't be entitled to a hearing unless the facts set forth in the application for waiver were sufficient, if true, to warrant a waiver in the opinion of the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.011" offset="3503417">In the Kleppe case, which involved an Act under which coal operators were assessed with fines, the statute there said, just like it does here, "opportunity for public hearing before those fines are assessed."</text>
            <text syncTime="865.228" offset="3564335">But this Court held, no, the agency can issue a regulation saying that you have to request that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.479" offset="3609266">And if you don't request the hearing, then it is deemed to be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.841" offset="3630686">And we have almost an identical-type regulation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.511" offset="3653465">It seems to use then that the issue is whether or not this requirement for an adjudicatory hearing -- that is set forth a material issue of fact -- is one which is a reasonable threshold requirement under the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.152" offset="3699963">And we think it is, for this reason, If it is not a factual issue, then there is no need for evidence or an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.339" offset="3740714">If it is not a material issue, then there is no need to consider it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.465" offset="3757223">And if there is no request made, it is reasonable to conclude people have no factual objection to the course of action that the agency proposes to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.679" offset="3814066">The second basic objection that we have is that this imposes an onerous burden on EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.481" offset="3841337">Now, of course if the statute calls for it, then we have to live with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.101" offset="3855757">But in the Du Pont case, Du Pont v. Train, this Court construing the very same statute said that it would be reluctant to construe the Clean Water Act to impose an onerous burden on the agency, because it would be hard to believe that Congress intended such a burden to be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.297" offset="3928586">This is very analogous to what would happen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.332" offset="3936737">Each year the agency issued about 2200 of these permits but in the past only about 100 adjudicatory hearings have been held.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.969" offset="3979264">Under the practical implication of the Ninth Circuit's opinion, the agency in most cases would now begin to hold hearings not in just 100 but in close to 2200 cases a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.104" offset="4031822">Because if we didn't do that, we would have to bear what the Ninth Circuit called "a very heavy burden of showing that a hearing would have served absolutely no purpose."</text>
            <text syncTime="992.924" offset="4075081">So that the practical thing to do to avoid that problem would simply be to hold one of these hearings, receive evidence, if the Ninth Circuit eventually required that, rather than to do what we do now; and that is simply to see if anyone requests one on a material issue of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.404" offset="4141014">I would like to reserve the balance of our time for rebuttal, with the Court's permission.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text syncTime="1024.683" offset="4202141">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.546" offset="4217605">The underlying dispute which causes this litigation to go forward is a dispute over a project in the City of Los Angeles which is called the Interim Sludge Disposal Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.117" offset="4275806">Now, it is true when we challenged the permit we were concerned about other issues but the primary underlying concern was this Interim Sludge Disposal Project which has been mentioned by Mr. Alsup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.282" offset="4324498">This project created a substantial controversy when it was first announced by EPA in a negative declaration in November of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.966" offset="4371205">Now, it is true that the permit requirements were issued in 1975 but if you look at the permit as it is contained in the appendix, you will see that it does not say what the disposal project is going to be when the sludge discharge is terminated; it does not detail what it is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.376" offset="4440900">So interested parties had no way of knowing what they were dealing with until the negative declaration announced the content, and that is when the controversy first arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.724" offset="4482278">I think the Court should understand that what this project is and, in particular, what this project is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.786" offset="4514565">It is argued in the brief and Mr. Alsup has indicated that this project proceeds pursuant to a compliance schedule which is going to terminate the sludge discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.826" offset="4550719">It does not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.701" offset="4558137">This project is what it says it is, it is an interim project, an interim sludge disposal project which modifies the sludge discharge pending some eventual decision about what the sludge discharge should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.376" offset="4612890">This modification, in essence what happens, instead of pumping the sludge out into the ocean it goes through large centrifuges, centrifuges split into two products, one, a semi-liquid goo which is the main product of the sludge, which is supposed to be trucked through huge gondola trucks and dumped in landfills in the Los Angeles area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.724" offset="4698258">And the estimates, if you read the City of Los Angeles' description of this, which is in the appendix, it says that if you live along that route one of these huge trucks is going to pass your home every 3-1/2 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.860" offset="4742771">Now, there still remains the primarily liquid product which is produced by the centrifuges, which still contains high concentrations of sludge particles and other materials in the sludge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.206" offset="4792195">Under this project, that continues to be discharged out into the ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.820" offset="4810689">So we are not implementing the requirements of the Water Act, we are not terminating the sludge discharge by this interim sludge disposal project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.220" offset="4840260">And that is one of the concerns that needs to be addressed in any public hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1207.304" offset="4932629">We would have two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.525" offset="4941511">Initially, I will describe for you our view of the facts as they progressed, which is considerably different from the description by Mr. Alsup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.213" offset="4980276">We believe that under the facts which progressed we had no way of putting into a request for a hearing detailed factual issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.026" offset="5015489">The purpose of the request of a requirement for the statement of factual issues of course is to be able to determine whether the factual issues upon which the agency's decision rests are in dispute, not just factual issues in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.205" offset="5072227">But at the time we had to prepare the request for adjudicatory hearing, EPA had withheld from us the decision, they had withheld any information as to why the reasons for the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.803" offset="5118621">They have provided us only with a telephone call which said, "We took the action on June 2, if you want an adjudicatory hearing you must request it today."</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.561" offset="5161566">That is why when you look in the record, it is a telegraphic request for hearing that was prepared in a matter of a couple of hours to meet a mandate by the Environmental Protection Agency that it be on file within two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.289" offset="5208482">So we believe that under those facts, the fact that this request for hearing stated only general issues is acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.387" offset="5240874">Besides that, we had been in dispute with EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.715" offset="5254248">EPA knew what the issues were we were concerned about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.966" offset="5403251">The request for hearing does say should the compliance schedule in the permit go forward, pending the environmental studies that will give us the information relating to what landfill should be used, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.717" offset="5454242">But it is the compliance schedule for the interim sludge disposal project that is challenged in that request for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.023" offset="5479424">And we believe that that was a specific enough notice of the factual issues we wanted to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.270" offset="5504502">The EPA before the Court of Appeals admitted that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3000.693" offset="12106167">Well, that is correct; but you know that is only one-half of the possible outcomes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.808" offset="12122572">The other one-half of the outcome is that tomorrow or reasonably soon -- even February or March -- this Court were to affirm what EPA did and then our enforcement action would proceed, the stay would be lifted and we would then be able to have enforced the permit that now exists and the conditions in that permit, rather than wait until the entire administrative process goes through it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.203" offset="12224136">Now, this permit does not expire on the 17th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.505" offset="12237406">That is by operation of section 558(c) of title V which provides that so long as there is a timely application for renewal the permit or license in existence continues by operation of law to remain in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.697" offset="12306160">So, for example, if -- I should say that these are complicated, it has been complicated by the 1977 amendments which allow under section 301(h) an additional application to be made by the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.517" offset="12361435">It is quite lengthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.724" offset="12366242">They have made that application, a lot of other cities have made those 301(h) applications, and not a one of them has been acted on yet because of the scientific review that is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.303" offset="12404590">It may be many months before the Environmental Protection Agency is able to act on the pending applications for renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.212" offset="12448266">By virtue of 558(c), in the meantime -- which could be as many as 11 or 12 months -- the existing permit does not expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.162" offset="12480031">And that is the reason this case has not become moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.901" offset="12566967">Absolutely; in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.238" offset="12572296">Now, the city resists that view and that is part of the litigation in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.718" offset="12590268">But our position in that enforcement action in Los Angeles is that concept approval, true, was given by the State, but that nonetheless triggered the compliance schedule that is at page 18 of the Appendix and required, many months ago, for the city to start phasing out putting the sludge in the ocean and putting it somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.715" offset="12674278">And by April of 1980, it was originally contemplated that that process would be complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.265" offset="12696430">Now it is way behind schedule because the city has fought us on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.227" offset="12716283">But, nonetheless, it is our position that the compliance schedule in the permit is already operative and they are in violation of that compliance schedule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3174.276" offset="12800502">The latter is our basic position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.699" offset="12814190">The permit simply says whatever you do with it, you can't put it in the ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.992" offset="12831326">And, the city, you can come up with your own scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.268" offset="12840417">The city did come up with its own scheme and it is called the Interim Sludge Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.146" offset="12855986">They decided to put it in landfills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.559" offset="12865599">It gets a bit complicated, because then they came to the Environmental Protection Agency and said "Would you help us fund this project"?</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.038" offset="12891512">And it was at that point that the EPA said "Yes, We will consider funding your project."</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.482" offset="12913351">And so the EPA is in fact involved on the funding side of approving the so-called Interim Sludge Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.010" offset="12951385">But had there never been any funding, the permit by its own terms would have said whatever you do with it, you cannot continue to put it in the ocean after April 1980.</text>
