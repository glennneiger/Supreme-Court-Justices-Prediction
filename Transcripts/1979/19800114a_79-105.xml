            <text syncTime="54.466" offset="321285">Mr. Del Deo, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="ralph_n_del_deo" startTime="58.286" stopTime="141.679">
            <label>Mr. Ralph N. Del Deo</label>
            <text syncTime="58.286" offset="336541">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.251" offset="352423">The question before the Court is whether the Third Circuit was in error when it vacated the entry of final judgment by the District Court pursuant to Rule 54 (b) after it had entered summary judgment in favor of Curtiss-Wright in the amount of $19 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.802" offset="438627">The -- this -- the Third Circuit based its opinion in the main on the existence of counterclaims which it said, presented a possibility of setoff and barred the entry of the final judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.780" offset="514487">This is a classic example of complex multi-claim litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.831" offset="534653">There are 21 contracts involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.807" offset="542595">There are 16 counts in the Curtiss-Wright's complaint ranging from fraud and misrepresentation on down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.227" offset="580315">The General Electric counterclaims allege extraordinary assistance and an unjust enrichment claim which they base on a fact that they helped Curtiss-Wright which prevented Curtiss-Wright from going into default and, therefore, General Electric is somehow entitled to the money that Curtiss-Wright would have lost had it been in default.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="141.679" stopTime="145.962">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="141.679" offset="670072">Could those counterclaims be fairly characterized as unliquidated?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_n_del_deo" startTime="145.962" stopTime="301.142">
            <label>Mr. Ralph N. Del Deo</label>
            <text syncTime="145.962" offset="687208">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.760" offset="690448">They are -- they are unliquidated and, you know, obviously, the proofs are difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.091" offset="715734">The amended complaint is the one on which summary judgment has been granted in this case, and that dealt with the balances due on the contracts for the nuclear components that were delivered and accepted by General Electric and its customer, and are now in use by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.527" offset="805491">The basis for summary judgment is really not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.627" offset="817925">There were no factual issues in the summary judgment case and the sole legal issue was the existence of a release clause which is referred to in the briefs as 5 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="194.236" offset="880306">That clause was that -- the interpretation of it was determined in favor of Curtiss-Wright and the summary judgment was granted to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.385" offset="916877">In the balance of the case, that release clause has no part.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.931" offset="939133">There is, therefore, no interrelation, factually or legally, between the claims on which summary judgment has been granted and the claims in the unadjudicated claims in the balance of the complaint or in the counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.959" offset="1007156">Now, the appellate court really doesn't question the qualification for finality here.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.182" offset="1044146">They'd have not contested the District Court's finding that there was no -- no separate -- that there was a separate and distinct claim here, that it could be decided separately, that there was no question of mootness or delay or duplicate of appeal or any of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.614" offset="1121782">They didn't deal with that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.930" offset="1127111">They -- they said that the presence of a counterclaim posing a possibility is -- of a setoff was a bar to the entry of the judgment, absent harsh and unusual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.098" offset="1195760">And they applied the standard of harsh unusual circumstances which is really akin to -- an irreparable harm standard because they talked about insolvency and economic duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.295" offset="1252603">They -- they admit that the result is harsh insofar as Curtiss-Wright is concerned, but they -- they somehow dismiss that injustice and say that it has to be almost an irreparable harm, you have to have insolvency.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="301.142" stopTime="321.795">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="301.142" offset="1307982">Mr. Del Deo, you -- I take it, you don't question either this -- of the statements in Sears, Roebuck versus Mackey that the district -- the primary discretion to certify under Rule 54 is vested in the District Court or that the Court of Appeals may review that certification for abuse of discretion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_n_del_deo" startTime="321.795" stopTime="462.519">
            <label>Mr. Ralph N. Del Deo</label>
            <text syncTime="321.795" offset="1390529">I -- I certainly agree, Your Honor that the Sears case -- I -- I emphasize that the primary discretion was in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.435" offset="1445073">And any matter in which a -- a court has discretion is obviously always subject to review by a -- by a higher court.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.169" offset="1484048">I think that in the Sears case, though, Your Honor, what we had was this, the Court enunciated three things that were important for a -- a Rule 54 (b) entry of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.639" offset="1541935">One was, they said that it had to be a -- a single claim for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.113" offset="1567848">Then, they said that claim had to be adjudicated finally.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.185" offset="1584149">And then they directed the discretion of the District Court to the fact that the District Court should then see that it was independent, factually and legally, from the balance of the claims in the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.237" offset="1640364">And that brings into it the attendant questions of -- of mootness, duplicate of appeals, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.339" offset="1672756">And on page 436 and 351 of the Sears case, and I'll paraphrase to some extent and quote to some.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.591" offset="1705775">They said it cannot well be argued that the claims stated in -- well, they talk about the claims here, it cannot well be argued that the District Court has abused its discretion in certifying that there exist no just reason for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.617" offset="1769827">And then, referring to the claims in that case, they said, “They certainly can be decided independently of each other.”</text>
            <text syncTime="425.120" offset="1803891">So, what we have here, Your Honor, is -- is a final judgment and the District Court, exercising its discretion under Rule 54 (b) to enter that judgment to where there's no just reason for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.621" offset="1877870">And the Sears case emphasizes the broad discretion that the District Court has.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.195" offset="1896155">And it was at that point that it focused on the discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.356" offset="1912769">This is entirely different than manners involving appeals from interlocutory orders because this is not an interlocutory order.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="462.519" stopTime="487.856">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="462.519" offset="1953416">But on 437, let me quote you this language from Sears, Roebuck.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.699" offset="1970134">The -- the Court says, “The District Court cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, treat as final that which is not final within the meaning of Section 1210 -- 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.939" offset="2007124">But the District Court may, by the exercise of its discretion in the interest of sound judicial administration, release for appeal final decisions upon one or more, but less than all, claims in multiple claims actions.”</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_n_del_deo" startTime="487.856" stopTime="488.624">
            <label>Mr. Ralph N. Del Deo</label>
            <text syncTime="487.856" offset="2054771">That's correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="488.624" stopTime="505.385">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="488.624" offset="2057906">And that -- and then it goes on to say “primary -- primary discretion in the District Court -- the abuse of discretion review in the Court of Appeals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="498.202" offset="2096149">Now, how do you articulate the standard by which you feel should have been applied by the Court of Appeals but wasn't here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_n_del_deo" startTime="505.385" stopTime="507.159">

            <text syncTime="505.385" offset="2124884">You mean in -- in the present case?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="507.159" stopTime="507.973">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>

            <label>Mr. Ralph N. Del Deo</label>
            <text syncTime="507.973" offset="2135228">Well, I -- I think that insofar as the standards are concerned, we did, pursuant to Sears, have a separate claim for relief and that claim was finally disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.784" offset="2182457">And in -- within the framework of the Sears decision, we have a final decision under -- under Section 1291 of 28 U.S.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.186" offset="2232090">Now, where the Court of -- where the Third Circuit has gotten impaled here, I think is on this question of a counterclaim because they have not applied -- excuse me, they have not applied universally this standard of harsh unusual circumstances to cases where there is no counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.136" offset="2331878">But, where they become impaled is where the counterclaim.Of course, the Cold Metal case disposes of the matter of the counterclaim being a barrier because that was decided right after Sears and said, “You could have a counterclaim, even a compulsory counterclaim.”</text>
            <text syncTime="571.535" offset="2389556">The Third Circuit, in my view, is, number one, treating it as an interlocutory order.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.007" offset="2423411">And in their Allis-Chalmers case inn which they rely, they use the specific words “interlocutory order.”</text>
            <text syncTime="587.916" offset="2455071">They say since final certification of an interlocutory order should occur only in the infrequent harsh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.637" offset="2489971">The dissent in that case picked that up and said the majority has blurred the distinction between appeals from final decisions, disposing of separate claims and those from interlocutory orders on appeals of ninth --</text>

            <text syncTime="621.427" offset="2589132">They confused that, they thought that 54 (b) was some type of interlocutory and the District Court can't make final that which is not final.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.455" offset="2629151">So, he can't certify under 54 (b) in the first place, unless -- he can't enter that judgment unless it's -- unless it's a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.195" offset="2668126">Now, as far as the counterclaims are concerned, the -- the Third Circuit is -- is worried about enforcement, and that is not a question of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.796" offset="2710549">They're worried about who shall hold the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.548" offset="2721520">In their -- in their decision, they -- they said the practical effect here, the practical thing that we're being asked to decide is who shall hold the money until the case is finally decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.850" offset="2774810">And -- and that really is not a Rule 54 (b) -- primarily a Rule 54 (b) consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.822" offset="2806680">As early as Reeves versus Beardall which was prior to the change in the rule from single transaction over to its present state, this -- this Court held that the stay provisions of Rule 54 (b) governed who should hold the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.607" offset="2873762">Now, what's happened now is that the 54 (b) stay provisions have been split off into 62 (h) which is now where you stay a 54 (b) judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.091" offset="2923708">So that, if you apply Reeves versus Beardall, you say, after the judgment has been entered, if you want to stay because you want us to determine who shall hold the money, then you go under Rule 62 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="722.263" offset="2992462">I think the fact that they -- they split that into a separate rule may well have been to avoid having the confusion of the processes under the stay provisions being confused in the processes under finality.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.432" offset="12597060">One is the provision or -- or the guidance provided by the advisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.673" offset="12630079">If they had thought when they specified the infrequent harsh case, we submit that we are talking about factors that are applicable uniquely to particular litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.784" offset="12686503">We are not talking about factors that are applicable to groups of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.095" offset="12707715">That is one source of our submission that it was improper for the District Judge to take the rate of interest into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.172" offset="12740106">The second source is the very concept of whether establishing and enforcing a rate of interest for judgment lies within the judicial province at all, whether it does now or whether it did when the rule was adopted or amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.047" offset="12807607">We -- we submit to Your Honors, it clearly is not within the judicial province that Congress, for federal judgments and state legislatures for state judgments have provided that the -- have provided what the rule should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.859" offset="12886810">And we cite the Funkhouser case as a holding of this Court which says that the establishment of a rate of interest on judgments is a matter for the legislative province.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.851" offset="12938742">So, we say to Your Honor that when a judge takes a factor into account which is within the legislative purview, he is not acting in a way which the Court of Appeals ought to sustain as a proper exercise of judicial discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.329" offset="13104671">In our view, it quite clearly falls upon the one who is proposing that the judgment be final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.920" offset="13131003">And this is a reflection, in our view, again of the bedrock consideration that the general rule is that there shall be no piecemeal appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.676" offset="13174053">So that it is the supplicant for the exception to the rule who has that burden and we say, in this case, there was no effort to meet that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.405" offset="13213027">There was no effort to show that there was anything unique about Curtiss-Wright which distinguished it from any other holder of a money judgment which would justify holding this to be the infrequent harsh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.898" offset="13270915">The fact that the -- the extent to which the claims and counterclaims may be independent or the prospective mootness of the issues, in our view, set the stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.446" offset="13325145">They do not deal with the question which is whether or not the time of the Court of Appeals and of the parties should be taken up with an appeal at this particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.950" offset="13379166">I note, for example, that the judge found that granting this certification would not prevent the rest of the case from coming to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.308" offset="13412603">He did not say that it would eat it and, quite clearly, any time there is an appeal, there is some diversion of the attention in the scope of resources in the litigation from the trial process to the appellate process, and this is part of the public policy which is involved in the rule against piecemeal appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.230" offset="13492328">And this is the general rue which is involved, in our view, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.005" offset="13519391">Now, it might be pointed out that the funds that are of concern here are not funds that have been available to the use of the General Electric Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.718" offset="13566203">They are funds, if you want to look for them, they are in a public fist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.020" offset="13583444">General Electric, under its prime contract, receives the funds only as reimbursement after it pays them out, so that there is -- the actual funds are funds in the treasury, rather than with General Electric and that's where they have been during this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.927" offset="13655124">In our view, to say that because considerations are appropriate under one Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, they may not be applied under another Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, is plainly inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.659" offset="13721997">Whether or not any of these considerations are appropriate to an application under Rule 62 (h) is beside the point, in our view, as to whether or not they are proper under Rule 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.104" offset="13771839">Each of these rules has different functions, and the function of Rule 54 (b) is related to the traffic to the appellate process and the exception to the general rule is a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.945" offset="13831189">Whether or not there ought to be a stay, pending an appeal or pending some other time, is not the province of Rule 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.656" offset="13869955">In effect, the disposition by the Court of Appeals here right now has led to the same practical result as a grant of the 62 (h) stay because, in effect, the Court of Appeals has said that there will be no execution of the judgment and there will be no appeal decision until after there has been trial of the other claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="3477.155" offset="14011956">In the first place, the difference between prejudgment interest rate and the interest which we would get even if this judgment were final and stayed is considerable because the New York prejudgment interest rate is significantly lower than the interest rate applicable to judgments, so the last statement that was made that the -- this has the same effect as a stay under 62 (h) is inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.520" offset="14141419">The -- we would still lose half a million dollar -- we would -- there's a half a million dollar differential a year just in the difference of prejudgment postjudgment interest rates.</text>
