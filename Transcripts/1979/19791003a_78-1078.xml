            <text syncTime="8.518" offset="137488">Mr. Rubin, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="12.729" offset="154311">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.128" offset="171865">This case presents a further variation on the issues which were examined by this Court in International Shoe, McGee, Hanson and Denckla, Shaffer, Heitner and the Kulko cases, Kulko case most recently, just last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.361" offset="268831">The order which is appealed from is a final order in -- on a writ of prohibition and this Court has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.990" offset="315329">The issues necessarily raised by this appeal are issues which go to questions of minimum contacts and purposeful activity, and therefore, I think we should refer briefly to the facts and the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.653" offset="406026">I think Your Honors will find that the facts and the record are discreet and limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.150" offset="447927">We have in this case, first, merely the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.759" offset="474363">We have a motion in which it was moved that the preceding be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.830" offset="518666">There was an opportunity for a hearing under the Oklahoma statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.646" offset="541968">At the hearing on the Oklahoma law, the plaintiffs had the burden of proving the jurisdictional facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.563" offset="585644">No facts were adduced at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.296" offset="604557">All that we have in the record then, Your Honors, is the pleading and there are affidavits which were interposed on behalf of the petitioners here which will be found in the appendix at pages 16 and 18 and that's all there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.285" offset="708524">Now, the facts indicate, Your Honors, that the plaintiff, the plaintiffs are New York residents as alleged in the complaint and it was determined again in the federal court when there was a -- an application to remove and the plaintiffs protested the removal and claimed that there was no diversity because they were New York residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.260" offset="832449">The complaint recites that defendant Seaway is a New York corporation which does business in Massena, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.061" offset="891591">Your Honors will be familiar with the fact that Massena is a community in the northern reaches of New York State.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.163" offset="948015">It also recites that World-Wide is a New York corporation and World-Wide has its offices in Orangeburg, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.768" offset="990438">World – the Seaway Company is a local dealer which engages in the sale of automobiles in Massena.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.633" offset="1033906">World-Wide is a wholesaler which has responsibility for the sale of automobiles to dealers in three States, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.545" offset="1213524">I take into account the language of the Court which talks in terms of the differences have to be differences in quality and not merely a matter of more or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.820" offset="1262634">And in terms of quality, I don't think that there is any difference, especially, Your Honor, I would like to call your attention again to the record and the affidavit which appears in the appendix at page 16 in which World-Wide expressly states that its business is limited to those three States that it has no intention of doing any business outside of those three States and specifically has no intention of doing business in Oklahoma.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.496" offset="2473357">Now, the Oklahoma statute provides for actions against nonresidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.451" offset="2505226">It -- interestingly enough makes two -- refers to two categories of cases where it will take jurisdiction, one, with respect to tortuous injuries in Oklahoma, one, where it's caused by acts or omissions in Oklahoma and the second, where it's caused by acts or omissions outside Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.072" offset="2615672">If the defendant regularly does or solicits business or engages in any other persistent course of -- course of conduct as you have it tracking pretty much of language which we have in the International Shoe case goes on to say or derives substantial revenue from goods, used or consumed or services rendered in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.170" offset="2732074">Now, the Oklahoma Court, the Supreme Court in its decision, first determined that the first section did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.394" offset="2776900">There was no act by the defendants within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.416" offset="2801037">It also determined that there was no act or omission outside the State which related to regular solicitation of business or to assist course of conduct but then by some kind of a magnum leap and logic, it says, on the other hand, we can say that because this car was in Oklahoma, that these defendants derive substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered in the State because this car must have cost a lot of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.266" offset="2968430">It's an item great cost and therefore, it must be deemed that these defendants derived substantial revenue from goods used or consumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.110" offset="3015764">I respectfully submit that that reasoning is totally untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.508" offset="3037393">The conclusion rests upon a decision of the District Court of New Jersey in Phil Tolkan case, which I think is patently wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.929" offset="3087130">The Tolkan case was a case of an automobile supply dealer, if you will, in Wisconsin that sold the jack to somebody who put in to his car and drove to New Jersey.</text>

            <text syncTime="800.588" offset="3305723">I think the same must be found to be true in this case because what this Court has done when it removed the abstractions, the fictions in Pennoyer and Neff and the Harris and Balk, this Court was seeking to find something more objective, more real on which decisions could be made, so in International Shoe those formulate of a concept of minimum context and we have the concept of purposeful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.662" offset="3486072">We're talking about action, movements, some -- something real, but it seems to me that the position which the respondents here take is a kind of a movement back to the abstraction, to the fictions which this Court is trying to sweep away.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.501" offset="4069334">In this case, we don't have any of those contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.476" offset="4085321">Here, we have merely the fact that a car that was sold in New York by a local dealer went to Oklahoma and had an accident and so far as World-Wide is concerned, it seems to me the most that the -- the respondents can say about World-Wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.871" offset="4170898">They don't even say they knew it existed at the time the transaction was entered into and there it becomes a major argument of this as the name of this company is World-Wide and so it must have anticipated somehow that it would be subject to jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.355" offset="7128795">This appears to be the first case to reach this Court involving the interpretation of a "long-arm" statute where a product and a physical injury was involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.009" offset="7371421">And it's long been recognized in criminal law that you can commit an assault with a dangerous or deadly weapon by use of the automobiles, so it is unique.</text>

            <text syncTime="3717.189" offset="14972113">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.878" offset="14990921">I've listened long but I haven't heard a thing about state lines for the federal system -- of federal court system for the rights of state courts to exist and function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.835" offset="15042748">And I believe that the comments by Mr. Justice Sobeloff become particularly poignant here because what is being suggested here is precisely what he was indicating could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.134" offset="15099904">He said individual States could undertake at the expense of other States enlarge the sphere of their authority to nationwide dimensions requires no flight of fancy to foresee the resulting maze of lawsuits, adjudicating interests of persons having only the faintest, most remote links of the state exercising authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.206" offset="15192168">The Due Process Clause is not effective to restrain such extensions of local power and the federal system is likely to be transformed into something very different from anything we have known.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.798" offset="15238562">I think that's precisely what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.738" offset="15250369">We have someone who is suggesting we go -- go have some kind of an idea of fairness as a misunderstanding to say the least of what Mr. Justice Stevens referred to when he talked about fair notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.977" offset="15307316">He certainly didn't talk about fair notice in the terms which my friend was arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.092" offset="15331767">I respectfully submit that this is just a case in which a State is reaching too far and the consequences in terms of adverse results including forum shopping is simply rife and therefore, the -- the action should be dismissed, the petition should be granted.</text>
