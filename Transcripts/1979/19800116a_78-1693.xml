            <text syncTime="21.612" offset="189837">I also might add that if the Court has mind to entertain those arguments, then the Government would be pleased if the Court would reach them in this case because it appears that even if the Government prevails on the arguments that we've made, those arguments could be raised in the context of condemnation proceeding, and this proceeding has already gone on for 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.722" offset="274265">So, it may be better to end it once and for all at this juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.576" offset="297671">As I think I indicated yesterday, the heart of the Government's case is the proposition that takings by seizure are not the functional or the legal equivalent of takings by condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.800" offset="342601">Both modes, of course, ultimately result in dispossession of the land owner, at least to the extent of the interest involved, but there the similarity ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.116" offset="379800">Before land can be taken by condemnation, several events must occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.121" offset="395891">A notice must be given to all parties with an interest in the land, and that's particularly important in the allotment context since allottees need not reside on their allotments and the United States Government certainly does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.832" offset="446673">Before land can be taken by condemnation, the land must be described.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.682" offset="466108">There must be determination of authority for the taking and this case illustrates the significance of that requirement, in that, given the dispute over the power of the City of Glen Alps to proceed by eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.260" offset="528384">Fourteen years after Glen Alps took over the road, a court finally determined that it did not even have the power to proceed in any fashion by eminent domain.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.711" offset="1414248">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.166" offset="1428041">There are two issues of statutory construction presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.011" offset="1443401">The first is whether Section 357 permits the condemnation of allotted Indian lands by seizure or, put another way, whether would be condemnors are required to file a judicial condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.955" offset="1503169">The second is whether highway rights of way across Indian-allotted lands can be obtained by condemnation at all or, rather, as Tabbytite contends, whether the statutes authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to grant rights of way over allotted Indian lands, subject to his conditions and requirements, is the exclusive means of obtaining the right of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.721" offset="1602226">Now, briefly, a textual argument with regard to the first issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.471" offset="1621243">The statute says that allotted Indian lands “may be condemned.”</text>
            <text syncTime="383.848" offset="1638797">It does not say “may be seized.”</text>
            <text syncTime="385.860" offset="1646843">It does not say “may be taken.”</text>
            <text syncTime="387.967" offset="1655202">It doesn't even say “may be acquired.”</text>
            <text syncTime="390.513" offset="1665442">Now, when land has been seized, we don't say it's been taken -- we do say it's been taken, we don't say it's been condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.653" offset="1702013">Condemnation requires one of two things, either a judicial proceeding initiated by the condemnor or a land owner's suit for just compensation which has come to be known as an inverse condemnation suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.586" offset="1765752">Now, that, I should say, there's no indication that the term “inverse condemnation” had been used at all in 1901 when Section 357 was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.441" offset="1809115">But the important point is that the land owner's suit for just compensation is the land owner's remedy and the condemnation cannot occur without either one of those two preconditions, either the land owner suit or the suit by the governmental authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.810" offset="1870660">And, in this case, neither of those things has occurred, so that neither condition precedent is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.065" offset="1899604">Therefore, the lands have not been condemned within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.138" offset="1919875">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="462.780" offset="1954461">Your Honor, our position on that is that seizure -- a blatant seizure of property without notice or an opportunity to be heard violates due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.168" offset="2000018">Inverse condemnation, again, is a land owner's remedy and, in a sense, when a land owner sues for compensation, he is acknowledging his notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.712" offset="2038262">He is, himself, pursuing his suit in a forum of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.310" offset="2068564">So, in a sense, the procedural due process issues on -- do not arise in an inverse condemnation setting, but seizures -- there is -- I would draw a distinction between advertent and inadvertent seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.506" offset="2121435">On many cases, most of the so-called inverse condemnation cases that have come to this Court involved situations where there's a good faith dispute between the Government and the land owner about whether Fifth Amendment-protected property rights have actually been invaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.442" offset="2177128">A classic example of that would be the Crosby case involving whether an invasion of air rights constituted a violation of a compensable property interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.814" offset="2282663">But, our position is certainly that Section 357 should be construed to -- in compliance with procedural due process requirements and, certainly, state and local authorities proceeding under Section 357 should be required to do what they should be doing in any event, namely, to provide opportunity and a notice to be heard to property owners whose rights stand to be invaded, just like they were required to do before terminating welfare benefits, before garnishing wages, before suspending driver's licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.594" offset="2409723">Indeed, it's hard to imagine how compensable property rights are entitled to any less procedural process protection than our -- other kinds of lesser property interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.066" offset="2547649">Now, the procedural due process aspects of the case are further highlighted by the declaration of takings laws in both federal and state laws, providing very meticulous procedures and, indeed, a court order before possession can be transferred prior to the payment of just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.337" offset="2616717">And, indeed, if seizures are permitted, these declarations of takings statutes are rendered completely superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.123" offset="2647855">Alaska statutes in that regard are especially meticulous in protecting the rights of affected property owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.119" offset="2675858">Now, aside from general procedural due process, the court -- this Court has been especially vigilant in assuring special fairness to Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.198" offset="2724133">For example, in 1978, the -- this Court decided in Santa Clara Pueblo against Martinez that Congress could not have intended to have created and employ cause of action by tribal officials against tribal officials because tribal officials had not had a prior opportunity to present their views to the Congress in the consideration of the 1968 Indian Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.498" offset="2829354">The Court relied on “the overriding duty of our federal government to deal fairly with Indians.”</text>
            <text syncTime="688.420" offset="2857044">Similarly, in the 1974 decision, Morton against Ruiz, needy Indians who were living near but off-Indian reservations were held not to be able to be denied welfare benefits by the Bureau of Indian Affairs by an unpublished ad hoc agency determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.589" offset="2925693">The Court held that their denial of assistance under these circumstances “is inconsistent with the distinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the Government in its dealings with these dependent and, sometimes, exploited people.”</text>

            <text syncTime="722.684" offset="2994134">That the Government -- that the BIA had represented in appropriations hearings time after time that it was providing assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.493" offset="3025377">I wouldn't say it would -- primarily, there was that aspect of the decision, but the Court also held that, even if the Bureau of Indian Affairs had the authority by Congress to reduce welfare benefits or even to eliminate them to off-reservation Indians, they haven't done it in a proper way in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.910" offset="3099042">So, it is even more difficult to ascribe to Congress an intent to allow Indian lands to be taken by seizure, a procedure, incidentally, that the Ninth Circuit itself, in another case and not an Indian case, described as “high-handed Government conduct and not to be favored.”</text>
            <text syncTime="766.232" offset="3168319">Now, the second issue that's presented by Tabbytite was left open in this Court's decision 40 years ago in Minnesota against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.016" offset="3203427">At that time, Solicitor General Jackson argued on behalf of the United States that highway rights of way across allotted lands could not be obtained by condemnation at all, but rather require the consent of the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to 25 U.S.C., Section 311 which, incidentally, was part of the same statute that also included Section 357, the 1901 Indian Appropriations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="997.191" offset="4092113">It reads, “the lands allotted in severalty to Indians may be condemned for any public purpose under the laws of the state or territory where located in the same manner as land owned in fee may be condemned and the money awarded as damages shall be paid to the allottee.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.602" offset="4249788">Section 357 is both a substantive and procedural statute concerning the law of eminent domain and is to be governed by the law of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.000" offset="4291375">The specific issues before us involve a sub-specie of condemnation or its synonym, eminent domain, which is called inverse condemnation or de facto condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.523" offset="4353442">Inverse condemnation, which is identical with de facto condemnation, is a taking of private property authorized pursuant to the laws of the state for public purpose without the prior filing of formal judicial eminent domain proceedings and requires subsequent payment and just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.454" offset="4441213">The specific task before this Court, in construing Section 357, is to determine whether it allows condemnation of lands allotted in severalty to Indians to be taken through a taking in the nature of inverse condemnation or de facto condemnation if the laws of the state applicable, allow a taking in the nature of inverse condemnation or de facto condemnation, as well as by formal eminent domain proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2514.784" offset="10162552">Eminent domain had been posed as an issue by the City of Glen Alps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.627" offset="10177912">There was hearing on the issue of necessity placed on the road, and the expert testimony is summarized in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.530" offset="10213543">The issue of authority by virtue of the Glen Alps counterclaim was before the court at that time in June of 1972, but because the court found an alternative theory of law upon which to make its decision that the road was public, an easement of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.878" offset="10278849">It dismissed the Glen Alps counterclaim as moot and refused to rule upon the issues that would otherwise have been presented if it had chosen an eminent domain theory upon which to rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.207" offset="10324198">It may well have chosen the same decision in June of 1972 that it did in November of 1976 that Glen Alps did not have that power, but it should not be thought by this Court that these issues were not before the trial court in June of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.054" offset="10387623">It just ruled on a different theory of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.667" offset="10406013">The issue has been before the courts on eminent domain by Glen Alps at every -- at all times since December of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.159" offset="10451989">Might I add two other quick observations, if I may?</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.213" offset="10468185">The date of evaluation nationwide, if this Court determines that -- I take it, the nature of inverse is allowed by Section 357 need not always be at the date of physical invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.951" offset="10523146">Under the laws of each state, the date of evaluation differs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.335" offset="10536730">Now, under Alaska law, City of Nesbett versus Anchorage is under United States law, Dow versus United States, that date is in fact the date of invasion, but it varies from place to place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.544" offset="10589497">Other states have the date of evaluation at the time of filing of complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.236" offset="10604335">Some, like California, under certain circumstances, have the date of evaluation at the time of trial or the payment of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.525" offset="10633488">So, it's not uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.413" offset="10641011">Now, two other things, one, the allegation is made by the United States in Tabbytite, “we would like to have an election of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.077" offset="10675702">We would like to have trespass and injunction as we -- as opposed to just compensation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.941" offset="10703182">Again, under the laws of the eminent domain statutes of each state, this varies from state to state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.722" offset="10726275">Under the State of Alaska, clearly, there is no election of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.595" offset="10741739">The Wickwire versus Jubelirer case decided that, but that's not uniform nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.953" offset="10763160">For instance, Colorado is at the other extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.658" offset="10774026">If you take the Aspen case versus Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph, cited by the Supreme Court of Alaska in 1974, the condemnee, if in a situation of inverse condemnation, was given such election remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.815" offset="10850617">So, this isn't a uniform thing nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.574" offset="10865664">Now, I would like to make two other observations, slight corrections in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.484" offset="10897324">I'd indicated in my brief that leg -- that administrative opinion and practice was of little consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.862" offset="10922820">At that time, I had not had access to the briefs of Minnesota, but I believe that the Minnesota case, 113 F.2d, Administrative Procedure is persuasive in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.990" offset="10971303">The last thing I wish to bring to the attention of the Court is that I have found one case in the reply brief of Tabbytite which is unfavorable to my client and I feel an ethical obligation to disclose this to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.793" offset="11034520">In the United States versus Northern Trading and Transport Company, Justice Brandeis ruled that condemnation and implied contract were different beasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.249" offset="11092407">However, in subsequent cases following that, the next year, the United States versus Rogers, 255 US 163, a similar situation was found to stem directly from the Fifth Amendment.</text>
