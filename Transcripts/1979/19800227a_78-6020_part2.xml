            <text syncTime="249.956" offset="1103182">The -- the point that I'm making about Section 924 (c) Your Honor is that the possibilities of prosection are not multiplied because of the number of weapons involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.484" offset="1153337">One is liable under 924 (c) either for using or for carrying firearm and the important distinction here is that Busic could have been convicted either for using vicariously LaRocca's firearm or carrying his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.952" offset="1235153">Now, what the Third Circuit has said in this case is that LaRocca who is the one spraying the parking lot with the bullets, to use the Chief Justice's observation, can be sentenced only once whereas Busic who watched and stood by and is only responsible vicariously can be punished twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.278" offset="1324492">As we read the Simpson case, we read Simpson to establish that a Simpson or a LaRocca type defendant can be convicted and punished only once, and that is for the underlying federal offense when that offense contained its own enhancement provision and it our position that Busic is entitled to identical treatment as LaRocca.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.129" offset="1431907">Now, the Government assumes in its brief that the Blockburger issues vanish because Busic was charged and sentenced for carrying his own weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.108" offset="1487809">Even (c) (2) is superimposed on an underlying or the underlying assault felonies and different elements are not required as to each.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.665" offset="1546010">There is an additional element for the 924 (c) (2) violation and that is the carrying of the firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.299" offset="1576521">I point out to the Court that under Section 111, the basic charge is forcible, assault or resistance or impeding a federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.628" offset="1617899">There is an enhanced provision if one uses a dangerous or deadly weapon or such as a firearm in doing that, but the underlying charge is fully included in the 924 (c) violation and therefore if this Court were to hold that our statutory contentions are invalid the Court would still be required to move on to the Blockburger issues and the Double Jeopardy issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.145" offset="1743914">I also point out that these assault incidents involve the same transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.443" offset="1769096">The unit of prosecution as I understand it is the assaults charged in the indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.104" offset="1799816">There are two transactions, the 924 (c) seems to apply to both of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.591" offset="2013706">If Busic and LaRocca are to be treated differently, obviously this will result in creating a very easy way to evade the protections which Simpson sought to create against double jeopardy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.636" offset="5109948">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.856" offset="5122800">In June of 1968, the Congress alarmed by recent public tragedies and arising incidents of firearm related crimes passed the Gun Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.063" offset="5167626">Among the principal provisions of that Act is Section 924 (c) which focuses directly on the crime problem by punishing the use and unlawful carrying of firearms in a commission of federal felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.459" offset="5225200">By its terms, Section 924 (c) is applicable to the commission of any federal felony, nevertheless, petitioners argued that they fall outside the scope of Section 924 (c) because the underlying or predicate felony of which they where convicted, assault on federal officers, provides an enhance penalty for using a deadly or dangerous weapon to commit the assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.609" offset="5321853">They contend that the enhancement provision of the predicate felony operates to the absolute exclusion of Section 924 (c) and that the Government is not authorized to prosecute under or the District Court to sentence under Section 924 (c) whenever the underlying offense contains its own enhancement provision for the use of a dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.116" offset="5411819">In support of their contention, petitioners rely on this Court's decision in Simpson versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.195" offset="5436165">They assert first that the holding in Simpson governs the instant case and second, that the Court's analysis in Simpson compels the result they urge here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.711" offset="5474200">We submit however that the issue in Simpson and the issue in this case are quite different and that neither the holding nor the reasoning of Simpson is controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.293" offset="5516518">The defendants in Simpson having convicted of armed bank robbery and have been given both an enhanced punishment under the bank robbery statute and a consecutive punishment under Section 924 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.795" offset="5562598">Thus, the issue in Simpson was whether cumulative sentences for the use of a firearm could be imposed under the enhancement provision of the bank robbery statute and under 9 -- Section 924 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.695" offset="5610141">In other words, whether the defendant's sentence could be doubly enhances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.983" offset="5627277">After noting at several places in the opinion that this was the issue for decision, the Court held that Congress had not intended to authorize such double enhancement and therefore that the defendant's use of a firearm could not be consecutively punished for the Section 924 (c) offense and for the aggravated bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.860" offset="5702823">This holding, the cumulative enhanced punishment for use of a firearm, are not permitted by Section 924 (c), does not dispose of the distinct issue presented in this case whether Section 924 (c) is applicable at all where the predicate felony contains an enhancement provision but their provision is not invoked and that's the defendant's sentence is not doubly enhanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.577" offset="5793729">It is one thing to hold that Congress did not intend that the aggravating circumstances of using a gun be twice punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.297" offset="5820583">It is a far different matter to hold, as petitioner seek here, that Congress intended the penalties provided in Section 924 (c) to be wholly irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1550.305" offset="6304580">That is this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.990" offset="6315342">Beyond the holding, the analysis employed in Simpson also does not require the conclusion that Section 924 (c) is applicable simply because the underlying felony provides an enhanced penalty for use of a dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.588" offset="6365706">The Court in Simpson relied on three general considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.107" offset="6379813">First, that the double enhancement of punishments was not necessary to promote the purpose or the deterrence rationale of Section 924 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.911" offset="6415026">Second that the legislative history and particularly a statement by Congressman Poff on the Floor of the House pointed in the direction of a congressional intent not to allow sentences to be doubly enhanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.652" offset="6466017">And third, that several canons of statutory construction supported the view that double enhancement was not authorized by Section 924 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.300" offset="6504573">Looking to each of these factors in turn, it can be seen that none of them supports the result urged by petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.825" offset="6530696">First, the statutory structure and purpose; the penalty provision of Section 924 (c) are unique and having been specifically designed to punish and deter firearm violations, they are fundamentally different both quantitatively and qualitatively from the penalties provided in Section 111.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.126" offset="6611884">With respect to the length of sentences, Section 924 (c) specifies an increased punishment for using a firearm of up to 10 years for first offense and up to 25 years for a second or subsequent offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.812" offset="6666637">In contrast, Section 111 increases the penalty where a dangerous weapon is used by only seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.570" offset="6701641">In addition, Section 924 (c) provides a mandatory minimum sentence of one year for first offenders and two years for second and subsequent offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.180" offset="6740093">Section 111 provides no mandatory minimum penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.729" offset="6758275">Section 924 (c) also establishes more severe penalties for recidivists than for first offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.467" offset="6789204">Section 111 on the other hand makes no provision for the imposition of increased sentences on recidivists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.106" offset="6815848">Finally, Section 924 (c) restricts the availability of probation, suspended sentences, and concurrent sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.728" offset="6846255">In contrast, Section 111 provides no such limitations on the discretion of the sentencing judge to exercise leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.016" offset="6879483">Petitioners have offered no reason why Congress would have meant Section 924 (c) to be inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.960" offset="6903202">In our view given the differences and penalty structures and given that the Gun Control Act was specifically designed to address the problem of firearms, it seems inconceivable that Congress intended that a defendant who uses a firearm to assault the federal officer would be completely exempt from sentence under Section 924 (c) and would instead be subject only to the lesser punishment provided in Section 111.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.363" offset="7004871">Thus, unlike in Simpson where the Court concluded that double enhancement was unnecessary to achieve the deterrence rationale in Section 924 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.064" offset="7039666">The decision in Section 924 (c) is wholly inapplicable in the instant case would disregard the special penalties provided in that statute and what frustrate the purposes of the Gun Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.435" offset="7089089">Moreover, again in contrast to Simpson to hold here that Section 924 (c) does not apply whenever the predicate felony contains an enhancement provision for the use of a dangerous weapon would lead to several illogical results that are inconsistent with the purposes of the Act and that Congress surely did not intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.469" offset="7169233">The first consequences of such a holding would be that the defendant who uses a firearm to assault the federal officer would be subject to different and less onerous penalties than one who uses a firearm to commit virtually any other federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.982" offset="7231300">Indeed, this result would have the particularly perverse effect rendering stiff penalty provisions of Section 924 (c) inapplicable to the very felonies that Congress had previously singled out for greater rather than lesser deterrence and punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.699" offset="7298173">Congress could not rationally have intended Section 924 (c) to produce such a result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1938.388" offset="7856880">Well I think they're all – well first, I don't think again that this area is any different than any other and it seems to me the prosecutorial discretion is at the very least unavoidable and is in fact desirable in order to fit the charge to the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.092" offset="7919783">But beyond that I think that the consequences of not allowing such discretion here and imposing the rigid and very narrow view words by petitioners would be far worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.335" offset="7968684">Another illogical result of the petitioners; construction would be the defendant who use a gun to assault a federal officer and one who uses some other dangerous weapon such as a knife would both be sentenced under exactly the same penalty provisions of Section 111.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.613" offset="8045798">Such a result would be contrary to the purpose of Section 924 to punish with special severity the criminal use of firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.817" offset="8082683">Moreover, since the recidivist provisions of Section 924 extend only to a second or subsequent conviction under that section, petitioners' interpretation would mean that a defendant who on several occasions uses a firearm to assault federal officers would not be covered by those repeat offender provisions and indeed he would remain outside those provisions even if he later uses a firearm to commit some other federal offence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.739" offset="8186337">On the other hand, the defendant who twice uses a firearm to commit virtually any other federal felony would be subject to those harsher penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.440" offset="8221132">The recidivist provisions were designed to punish with heightened severity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.339" offset="8236701">Those people who have shown themselves to be recurrent abusers of firearms and no reason suggested so why Congress would have wanted the applicability of the recidivist provisions to depend upon whether the prior armed offense consisted of an assault instead of almost any other federal felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.132" offset="8307858">Finally if we are correct as we contend in our brief and we rely on the argument there that Section 924 (c) at all events prohibits the unlawful carrying of a firearm during the commission of an assault on a federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.789" offset="8362506">Petitioners' construction would mean that the defendant who actually uses the firearm would be subject solely to Section 111 while the defendant who only carries but does not use a firearm would be sentenced under the more stringent provisions of Section 924 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.608" offset="8425827">Well Congress wanted to punish and deter both the use and the unlawful carrying of firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.257" offset="8448397">It is impossible to believe that Congress intended to authorize more severe sanctions for unlawfully carrying a firearm and for its actual use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.774" offset="8490506">In sum, the first consideration relied on in Simpson, the purpose of the statute, demonstrates here that Section 924 (c) is not inapplicable where the predicate felony contains its own enhancement provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.048" offset="8547558">The legislative history of Section 924 (c) the second factor relied on in Simpson also demonstrates that an armed assault on a federal officer is punishable under Section 924 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.070" offset="8599698">This history makes it plain that Congress wanted to punish and to deter by means of stern measures the criminal use of firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.319" offset="8636688">Congress recognized that this objective turned on a certainty as well as the severity of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.358" offset="8660825">Congressman Poff in introducing the Amendment that ultimately formed the basis for Section 924 (c) expressly stated that his proposal was stronger than the then pending Casey Amendment because it restricted the imposition of concurrent sentences, suspended sentences and probation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.627" offset="10717915">The Dominick Amendment had allowed the double enhancement of punishments in a way that the Court in Simpson held Congress had not intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.961" offset="10747173">The Court in reaching that result had relied on the rejection of the Dominick Amendment that in the Court's in view corroborated their reading of the Poff statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.606" offset="10789804">I don't think that the rejection of the Dominick Amendment bears on the issue before the Court in this case whether the prosecutor has discretion to prosecute under 924 (c) in lieu of prosecution under the enhancement provision of Section 111.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.486" offset="10865351">In addition to the legislative history, the Court in Simpson also relied on several maximums of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.294" offset="10908505">In this case those maximums do not lead to the conclusion that section 924 (c) is inapplicable whenever the predicate felony provides for an enhanced penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.454" offset="10953226">The Court in Simpson first invoked the usual role of avoiding constitutional decisions where possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.950" offset="10979140">In Simpson, the Government had relied on identical evidence to prove violations of Sections 924 (c) and 2113 (d) the aggravated provision of the bank robbery statute and the defendants who'd received consecutive sentences under those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.220" offset="11040266">In such circumstances the Court observed that there was the prospect of double jeopardy and following settled practice, it does look to see whether an interpretation of the statute was fairly possible to avoid the potential constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.331" offset="11096691">Here in contrast no analogous constitutional question is involved because under the Court of Appeals decision, petitioner's sentence cannot be doubly enhanced for the use of a firearm and hence this cannon of construction is not pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.148" offset="11160012">The Court in Simpson also relied on the rule of lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.390" offset="11176939">However, this rule is simply an auxiliary aid in discerning the congressional intent and it applies only when a Court has looked to all other available sources for guidance on the meaning of a statute and is still left with a serious ambiguity or uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.368" offset="11256874">Moreover as the Court has recognized on other occasions even a criminal statute is not to be so strictly construed that the legislative purpose is defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.032" offset="11295535">Given the structure, purpose, and legislative history of Section 924 (c) in giving the untenable results to what occur under petitioners' construction, the rule of lenity does not bear on a present issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.229" offset="11352273">Finally the Court in Simpson referred to the principle that precedents be given to the more specific of the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.608" offset="11385814">However, this principle cannot be determinative whereas here the language, purpose, and history of the Act consistently point in the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.412" offset="11433044">Moreover, we do not understand the Court in Simpson to have held as a general matter that only one criminal statute can apply to a given situation simply because that statute maybe considered to be the most specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.016" offset="11491453">Such a proposition would be of dubious soundness and would contradict many long standing decisions of this Court and of the Court of Appeals that have consistently held to the contrary and have allowed the prosecutor discretion to choose among two or more statutes that apply to a given set of facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.997" offset="11711404">We think the Court in Simpson relied on the Doctrine of Specificity only to illustrate that there are instances other than the particular one in Simpson in which two statutes are not simultaneously applicable to a given situation despite their literal language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.252" offset="11776397">In this way the notion of specificity served to corroborate the conclusion already drawn from a legislative history of Section 924 (c) and from the rule of lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.766" offset="11818402">However, this doctrine is in opposite in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.811" offset="11830627">Since Section 924 (c) and the enhancement provision of Section 111 are not being simultaneously applied to petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.775" offset="11874513">The Court in Simpson also cited to a prior Department of Justice position on the applicability of Section 924 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.343" offset="11916727">I think a reading of the United States Attorney's bulletin and cited by the Court in Simpson will show that – that the bulletin was not meant to be a definitive legal interpretation of the statute but rather was designed as advise to U.S. attorneys to be aware of and avoid possible problems under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.336" offset="11988720">Indeed the bulletin and expressly recognized that Section 924 (c) could be charged in the discretion of the prosecutor even where the predicate offense contained in enhancement provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.055" offset="13387630">Yes Mr. Chief Justice, I'll try to be brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.353" offset="13400795">I think the most recent colloquy very happily demonstrates that this case cannot be resolved on the basis of an analysis of anomalies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.433" offset="13441128">There are anomalies all over the place and it won't do for the Government to point to those to justify its position.</text>

            <text syncTime="3340.603" offset="13465788">Does it suggest to you, Mr. Goldman that those members of the House who were present when Mr. Poff made his statement, there's a question how many of them do you think understood what he was saying and what its impact was and what the whole problem was?</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.747" offset="13582399">How many of them do you think understood what you understand his statement to be let's put it that way?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="3378.644" offset="13617925">Well because I think his words accurately conveyed his thoughts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.842" offset="13630777">I believe those who listened to him and read what had to say agreed with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.102" offset="13655751">The fact is that some of these preexisting statutes do read in terms of shall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.333" offset="13676753">That's true of the provision in 2114 and under Simpson its clear that a prosecution can't rely under 2114 and under 924 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.319" offset="13728684">The proper resolution is indeed the one that Representative Poff said he intend to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3412.087" offset="13751672">Well if the Government says you can convict under both and that you can sentence only on the one.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="3419.409" offset="13781034">But that would be to contradict the shall mandatory language in one or the other of these two statutes both of which provide for mandatory sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3441.126" offset="13867865">Mr. Poff's statement is understood by everybody to forbid cumulative sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.925" offset="13899107">In fact I think it's helpful just to quote for a second from the Justice Department's own U.S. Attorneys bulletin in the 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.973" offset="13939231">They said then a number of federal statutes already include special provisions providing for increase penalties where firearms is used in the commission of the offense and they gave some examples including Section 111.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.805" offset="13990640">Since the specific provisions of these statutes may take precedence over the general provisions of Section 924 (c) (1), the specific provision should be used where applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.498" offset="14049364">Now, it doesn't assist the Government's case to emphasize the deterrent purpose of Section 924 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.616" offset="14077785">If it is necessary to accomplish Congress' purpose to apply 924 (c) then it's necessary to do that in every single case and yet even the Government concedes that there's been no implied repeal of Section 111.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="3519.458" offset="14181230">But there is even an implied repealed pro tanto for the area of the overlap, the Government concedes that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3528.811" offset="14218637">They claim that there's the alternatives were available but we've held it wasn't bad older or the other, not long ago that you can have alternative provisions of the same conduct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gerald_goldman" startTime="3537.792" stopTime="3551.967">
            <label>Mr. Gerald Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="3537.792" offset="14254582">Yes that's true but in Bachelder there was affirmative evidence that Congress intended precisely that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.476" offset="14281226">Moreover neither statute in Bachelder there could be said to be more specific than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.945" offset="14303169">Present case is distinguishable in both counts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3551.967" stopTime="3575.312">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3551.967" offset="14311215">Mr. Goldman the thing when you look through the whole argument before the statute was passed Congress has said there shall be specially severe penalties for carrying a gun with certain limited numbers of offences and you construe it as anyone when they wanted to deter the use of guns they decided to get have the penalty for those offences to be less rather than greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.632" offset="14397942">It just doesn't seem to make much sense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gerald_goldman" startTime="3575.312" stopTime="3581.898">
            <label>Mr. Gerald Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="3575.312" offset="14404629">But that's not true across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.624" offset="14413824">Some of the penalties in the preexisting statutes -- are more serious.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3581.898" stopTime="3597.771">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3581.898" offset="14430960">But where it is true doesn't it seem to fit more squarely under the congressional purpose to say that Congress intended generally speaking to make more severe punishment applicable to using guns and you've been affected, that applies everywhere expect where they'd already taking care of the gun problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gerald_goldman" startTime="3597.771" stopTime="3677.223">
            <label>Mr. Gerald Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="3597.771" offset="14494490">Well I can only repeat our position that the person who sponsored this provision said in what we regard to be absolutely unequivocal language that he did not intend to address the problem of statutes where there is already a deterrent purpose being served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.798" offset="14590516">The normal presumption I would think would be that Congress does not intend to duplicate itself in enacting criminal laws and yet that's exactly what the Government is suggesting here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.213" offset="14636178">Now that happened in Bachelder, but there was affirmative evidence to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.218" offset="14656240">In this case the evidence is just the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.114" offset="14667839">In addition, there is an additional tool of statutory construction in the interpretive preference for specific criminal laws that applies here and it did not apply in Bachelder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.472" offset="14725308">One last word it's our position that when a sentence is vacated that also serves to vacate the conviction because a judgment of conviction requires a sentence under the federal rules so that when the sentence was vacated on remand in Simpson that also served to vacate the conviction.</text>
