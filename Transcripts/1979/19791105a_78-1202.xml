            <text syncTime="45.143" offset="287054">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.241" offset="295414">This matter is on certiorari to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.858" offset="305863">It concerns the scope of section 10(b) of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and, more particularly, whether it is a violation, a criminal violation of that statute for a purchaser of stock who is not an "insider" and had no fiduciary relation to a prospective seller to purchase that stock without revealing that he had obtained information from a source thoroughly outside the issuer corporation, that is, not inside information but outside information created by the outside source.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.678" offset="465105">Mr. Chiarella, the petitioner, was employed in 1975 and 1976 as a mark-up man in Pandick Press, which is a financial printing house in downtown New York, and while there he came upon and in possession of information from customers of Pandick with respect to their intention to tender through other corporations, and using that information which he obtained from the customers in his capacity as a mark-up man, he went into the open market and he purchased shares of stock in the target corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.192" offset="607211">He didn't tell anyone he was doing that; he just did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.585" offset="624765">The issue in this case is whether he had any relationship with the seller of the shares, which would have mandated that he make a disclosure, or whether pure nondisclosure where there is no fiduciary or other special relationship amounts to a violation of 10(b).</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="148.847" offset="701879">Well, you said no special relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.980" offset="718388">What if an author has written a book and he takes it to a printer to have it printed, and at this stage there's no problem about copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.133" offset="763005">Do you think there is a special relationship between the printer and the author to take no step that would jeopardize his copyright standing?</text>

            <text syncTime="175.893" offset="810026">I would agree that there is a relationship between the author and the printer, who is an agent of his principal, the printer, but there the remedy would not be something which is analogous to section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="187.197" offset="855270">It would be a state remedy which I think would be most appropriate here.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.113" offset="886930">My question was directed at only your statement that there is no special relationship between the customer and the printer.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.055" offset="922666">No special relationship between the seller of the stock in the open market and the printer.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.268" offset="947534">There is a relationship of sorts, special, between Mr. Chiarella here, the printer, and the customers of Pandick.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.295" offset="983583">But that is not at issue, I say, here, though I will deal with that in a moment, because the Solicitor General seems to suggest it may have some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.005" offset="1018483">The statute prohibits the employment of any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in violation of particular rules which are promulgated by the SEC. Simply put, there has been no deception, no manipulation here within that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.205" offset="1095283">This is a case of no more than a breach, if you will, of some kind of state fiduciary duty which Mr. Chiarella may have owed the customers of Pandick.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.176" offset="1151185">If you look at the history of this particular litigation, you will see a remarkable effort on the part of the District Court and then the Circuit Court and now the Solicitor General to formulate an entirely new theory of relationship in order to impose 10(b) liability on Mr. Chiarella.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.308" offset="1235717">In the District Court you had a simple, straightforward classic insider analysis used.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="371.856" offset="1593908">In the Second Circuit?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_s_arkin" startTime="372.496" stopTime="607.039">
            <label>Mr. Stanley S. Arkin</label>
            <text syncTime="372.496" offset="1596416">In the Second Circuit, in that circuit alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.829" offset="1609791">But if you look at what took place in the trial court, the imposition of the classic insider duty and it was sorely inappropriate and it was imposed on the theory that he had no legitimate business purpose in his trade, that is, Chiarella didn't, whereas the tender offer corporations whom he sought to identify himself with had some legitimate economic purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.160" offset="1699129">Interestingly, this theory was rejected at the circuit level and an entirely new effort to push this conduct into 10(b) was formulated which has been referred to as the market insider rule, that is, the Second Circuit rule that since Mr. Chiarella was employed in a printing house which had access to financial information on a regular basis, that that regular receipt of information somehow put him into a particular category of status requiring him to disclose or abstain, as the case may be, and of course somebody in that position would really, if the Court of Appeals were correct, have a duty to abstain, and disclosure would not be something which would be relevant or work at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.613" offset="1880942">That particular test formulated by the Second Circuit was entirely new, expansive, novel approach to section 10(b), was rejected in a footnote by the Solicitor on the ground that it was insufficiently discreet, that is, that rule would encompass the activities of market professionals and others who perform a worthy market function and that accordingly that rule wouldn't obtain, and an entirely new rule or rules, again an effort to push this conduct into a particular box, was formulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.166" offset="2019077">The theory which the Solicitor General now advances in its effort to demonstrate some relationship Chiarella had is that by somehow reaching a duty, committing some kind of tort, vis-a-vis the tender offeror, the customer of Pandick, that that, as if it were a contagious disease, was carried over into the transaction between Mr. Chiarella and the purchaser on the open market; and then, secondly, on the other hand that somehow Mr. Chiarella by virtue of having this superior information which he obtained in a -- and I am quoting the Solicitor General -- "a tortuous manner," that that itself created a direct duty by Mr. Chiarella to the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.179" offset="2207159">Neither one of those theories wash.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.402" offset="2216040">Neither one of them should stand up to analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.102" offset="2230878">They simply totally obviate prior law under section 10(b) and the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.431" offset="2256165">With respect to whether or not there is any relevance as to whether Mr. Chiarella did anything to the tender offeror, the customer, of course that wasn't charged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.513" offset="2316455">The case was not indicted that way, it wasn't tried on that theory, it wasn't charged to the jury on that theory, so that is an entirely novel and new approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.887" offset="2349996">But aside from the fact that it is not in the case except at the appellate level, really, there would have been no duty of Chiarella here because it is a tender -- not the tender offeror, it is the customer, the seller of the stock which 10(b) is directed at, aimed at, and there was no relationship of Chiarella to that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.503" offset="2452501">And so what happened vis-a-vis the tender offeror we say is not relevant at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.011" offset="2474444">Moreover, there was really no fraud there.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.574" offset="2484788">At most, I think you could say there was an unauthorized use of information and I would suggest that not all fiducial breaches, not all unauthorized conduct --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="607.039" offset="2534630">Well, his conduct certainly wasn't very appealing to a person of ordinary moral standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.017" offset="2554483">That doesn't necessarily mean it is criminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="613.726" offset="2561379">Well, not very appealing but that is most respectfully, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, hardly a standard to bring within a statute enacted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.460" offset="2592308">No, it was not but it was a kind of conduct which should appropriately be dealt with by the state with a vast body of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.484" offset="2620416">He could have been sued in conversion, he could have been fired, as it was, sued for breach of contract, or possibly sued under a theory of unlawful acquisition of a corporate opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.599" offset="2668795">But it certainly wasn't within 10(b) and, of course, not all unappealing conduct or undesirable conduct is within the common law or statutory meanings of fraud or manipulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.287" offset="2727623">Mr. Justice Blackmun, under New York state law I don't believe it was, but there are statutes in other states in this country which would seem to proscribe what is called industrial espionage, that is taking a secret of an employer and using it for your own benefit, and so possibly in some states it might be deemed criminal, but not in New York to my knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.801" offset="2845696">I don't know, but I believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.151" offset="2855100">We have checked the statutes on that and could find no statute which would make his conduct criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.396" offset="2875998">I suppose that one might attempt to fashion some kind of unlawful taking from what Mr. Chiarella did, but our analysis of the statutes is such that that couldn't be done, but to be fair we thought about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.579" offset="2940782">Insofar as Mr. Chiarella's relationship to the seller himself, of course there was no privity between the two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.690" offset="2985190">Mr. Chiarella classically made no misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.440" offset="3000236">He didn't say a half truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.448" offset="3008282">He had no duty to that seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.979" offset="3018313">He had no reason, if you will, to have made a disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.208" offset="3043286">There is no rule of law that says he must.</text>
