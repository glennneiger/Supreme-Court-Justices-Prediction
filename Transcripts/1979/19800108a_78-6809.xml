            <text syncTime="18.273" offset="176462">If there is one major shortcoming in the administration of criminal law in this country it is in the restricted interpretation given to the concept of the presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.768" offset="234454">In my years at the criminal trial bar I have so often heard trial judges instruct the jury the defendant is presumed to be innocent and that the presumption starts at the beginning of the case and continues on until his guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.641" offset="313971">I think that that is a misleading, if not mistaken, notion of the presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.745" offset="338317">I think that we are all as members of this society presumed to be innocent of the commission of crime.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="68.766" offset="378441">Wouldn't you say that Bell v. Wolfish last year that the presumption of innocence was something a word of art peculiar to criminal trials?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl Ziemba</label>
            <text syncTime="79.263" offset="420446">Yes, but I think that that is a restricted concept of it.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_ziemba" startTime="85.033" stopTime="185.210">
            <label>Mr. Carl Ziemba</label>
            <text syncTime="85.033" offset="443538">I agree with the Court's declaration so far as the Court went.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.190" offset="464123">But I would say that the reason why a police officer has to have probable cause to believe that somebody has committed a felony or to see the person commit a misdemeanor in his presence before he can lay hold of him is because that person is presumed to be innocent of the commission of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.227" offset="556283">I think that the very genious of our system of criminal jurisprudence starts with the presumption of innocence which invests every member of our society and it must follow from that in our system of jurisprudence, criminal jurisprudence that if a person is presumed innocent he cannot be burdened with the duty of proving his innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.924" offset="667042">And therefore if the State accuses a person of crime the State has the burden of proving that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.892" offset="706957">And then of course they have evolved all of the facets of the principle of the right of nonincrimination investing every individual, which means to say that if the State chooses to charge a person with crime the State has the burden of proving that charge beyond a reasonable doubt without any assistance at all from the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.233" offset="812283">And there is no burden upon the defendant to make an explanation or to make exonerating statements.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="185.210" offset="844257">Well, the defendant can be called before a grand jury and required to give blood samples, handwriting analysis, and that sort of thing; can he not?</text>

          <turn speaker="carl_ziemba" startTime="193.648" stopTime="199.254">
            <label>Mr. Carl Ziemba</label>
            <text syncTime="193.648" offset="878007">That is true, but we have said that that is not testimonial in nature, have we not.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="199.254" offset="900368">Yes, but I take it the State wouldn't do it if it didn't feel it was helping prove its case.</text>

          <turn speaker="carl_ziemba" startTime="203.255" stopTime="248.422">
            <label>Mr. Carl Ziemba</label>
            <text syncTime="203.255" offset="916355">Well, I suppose not.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.212" offset="928266">Of course that is not to say that I am in absolute agreement with the concept that giving blood samples and things of this nature is not compelling a person to give evidence against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.509" offset="981452">But of course I am in the minority on that point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.952" offset="999215">But we do recognize the fundamental principle that when one is hailed into court and put on trial and all of the State's evidence marshaled against him is presented in court he still has the right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.027" offset="1075493">And nobody can comment upon that, upon the fact that he did remain silent.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="248.422" offset="1097017">But once he takes the stand in his own behalf the situation undergoes some change, doesn't it?</text>

          <turn speaker="carl_ziemba" startTime="255.896" stopTime="378.128">
            <label>Mr. Carl Ziemba</label>
            <text syncTime="255.896" offset="1127006">Yes, it does but we cannot -- we cannot punish a person for exercising a constitutional right simply because he exercises another right, and that is the right to give evidence under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.737" offset="1190327">In other words, here we have -- we have the potential of a person reading in the newspaper that the authorities suspect him of the commission of some crime though there is no formal charge made against him but still it is brought about that X done so and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.406" offset="1272978">Now, X must decide instantaneously then before any charge is formally filed against him whether he is going to testify in his trial if it should ever come to that, you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.628" offset="1317909">Because if he intends to testify in his trial he had better come out with an explanation in the face of these rumors and the stories in the newspapers now.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.315" offset="1352600">Otherwise, he is going to be damned on trial by his pre-trial silence in the face of these accusations.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.909" offset="1379035">I do not think that supports our basic tenets and principles of fairness and justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.118" offset="1419891">Now, if it is true that it is true that a person who stopped on a street by a police officer and is asked question about the commission of some crime has a perfect right not to answer the police officer, then how can we say that any duty devolves upon that person when he hears that he might be charged with crime or that he is suspected of a commission of crime has a duty to seek out the police, go down to the police station, stop the police officer on the street in a scout car and say "One moment, please.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.537" offset="1581537">You have got to go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.893" offset="1590941">I acted in self defense Or, "It was an accident," or "I wasn't there," or whatever the case might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.994" offset="2779303">My practice in the State of Michigan is almost exclusively criminal work and I cannot answer these questions, why in a certain case the court will invoke the Constitution of the United States and of the State of Michigan and reverse a conviction and in other case -- well, I can't discern any fact the difference the court gives me an unpublished opinion in which they say "We examined the record and find no error."</text>
            <text syncTime="697.437" offset="2893093">I have no explanation for it, for that phenomenon I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.700" offset="2914200">But let us imagine two persons engaged in an activity and the police surprise them and one is seized and the other runs and makes good his escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.812" offset="2990582">The one who is seized is immediately told by the police "Now, you have the right under the Constitution not to say anything."</text>
            <text syncTime="728.170" offset="3016077">He is given his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.427" offset="3025063">And the second culprit has remained at liberty for two weeks, he hasn't come forth with any explanation or he hasn't stopped in a police office, he hasn't gone into any police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.925" offset="3071039">But eventually he is taken into custody and both placed on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.662" offset="3090056">The chap who had the misfortune or good fortune to be arrested at the scene and given his Miranda warnings, he can risk complete impunity, take the witness stand and give exculpatory evidence without being damned for exercising his right to silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.604" offset="3161840">The fellow who was at liberty for two weeks, he gets on the stand and he is impeached, he is shown to be lying on trial because he remained silent in those two weeks he is at liberty --</text>

            <text syncTime="869.831" offset="3582725">Then the petitioner here being dissatisfied with his appointed counsel's brief, filed a motion for reconsideration -- an application for reconsideration to the Michigan Court of Appeals within the time allocated by the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.231" offset="3652315">And he raised this specific issue and the application for reconsideration was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.154" offset="3687946">The petitioner then proceeded pro se to make application to the Michigan supreme Court in a discretionary appeal and he presented this issue before the court, among others, to make Michigan Court -- Michigan Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.476" offset="3749282">And the Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal, stating that they are not persuaded that the questions should be reviewed by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.638" offset="3785958">Now, I might point this out that the State of Michigan neither in the Court of Appeals nor in the Michigan Supreme Court nor in the Federal Supreme Court on the petition for writ of habeas corpus nor on the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit raised the issue that there was failure to make a contemporaneous objection at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.907" offset="3883029">In other words, that issue has never been raised in this case until it has come here under petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.756" offset="3918346">And I think that if the defendant is chargeable for neglecting to object on the -- on trial, the State of Michigan is chargeable for not raising that objection any place during the appellate procedures and processes until it has come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.402" offset="4013014">And I might point this out further, Your Honor, that in the State of Michigan we do have a plain error doctrine and it is invoked most frequently when constitutional rights are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.321" offset="4064632">So the Michigan Court of Appeals and/or the Michigan Supreme Court could have -- could have entertained this question and reversed the conviction even in the absence of an objection by the petitioner at the trial level.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.220" offset="5644204">But nonetheless it is a fact of jury trials that if the jury believes that the alibi witnesses are lying, they will say "Uh, he must be guilty, because they are lying."</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.627" offset="5717870">you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.688" offset="5722154">And so they also come -- they also come to a jury trial with the preconception that if a defendant has nothing to fear, he is not guilty, why doesn't he get up on that witness stand and say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.811" offset="5794565">Why doesn't he get up there and deny his guilt, you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.666" offset="5806059">And then when the defendant gets on the witness stand and the prosecutor says "You can't believe him, you can't believe him because if what he was telling you in court today is true he would have come voluntarily into the police department soon after that onslaught as he possibly as he possibly could get and explain 'You have got it all wrong, I acted in self defense,'" you see.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.533" offset="7473507">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.650" offset="7490017">Bearing in mind that the most basic tenet of the Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate yourself is compulsion, the State of Michigan takes a position that in this cause there is no Fifth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.328" offset="7564727">This man was not compelled to testify against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.678" offset="7582072">The contention is that by exploring his flight and concealment that his "silence" was infringed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.562" offset="7637661">I have difficulty in conceiving this voluntary flight and voluntary concealment to be in the category of silence, certainly not in a testimonial sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.689" offset="7698160">A man contends that once he exercises his Sixth Amendment right, takes the stand with counsel at his side and testifies and speaks of his absence, he brought it all on, that we are barred from cross-examining on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.356" offset="7784782">Incidentally, of the 30 or more pages of the testimony given by this man, less than a page I think -- it is less than a page in the appendix concerning the examination of this flight and concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.104" offset="7859806">I doubt whether it had any serious impact upon the jury at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.566" offset="7889586">In fact keep in mind that this man was charged under Michigan law with first degree murder, conviction of which requires mandatory life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.175" offset="7940054">But evidently this story of an alibi -- or self defense, rather, did have some impact upon the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.197" offset="7972133">They came in and found him guilty of manslaughter, which is a 10- to 15-year sentence which he did receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.861" offset="8002853">Now, it is not Doyle case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.360" offset="8036812">Doyle held that because of the oppressive conditions of the police station and the features thereof that you couldn't infringe upon that and make mention of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.936" offset="8107133">But here in this case he brought it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.875" offset="8122911">There was no compulsion, no Fifth Amendment problem involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.847" offset="8146735">This Court way back many years ago I think in Raffel said that once the accused takes the stand the prosecution has full sway in the matter of issues pertinent to the cause and to cross-examine thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.592" offset="8221759">I move along a bit to perhaps a knottier problem involved here, and in Doyle was a due process question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.716" offset="8278288">The question is whether -- did the probative value of examining him on his escape and concealment, or flight and concealment, did that outweigh the prejudice that was done to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.219" offset="8344221">I would have to say "No," and I think the finding of a lesser -- guilt of a lesser offense definitely proves that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.364" offset="8388838">Was there such a fundamental unfairness in his trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.949" offset="8407124">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.263" offset="8416423">Oh, the prosecutor made the rather shall I say tacky remark that perhaps during his flight and concealment he was lining up witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.579" offset="8465638">I think he also referred to that in one sentence in his summation to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.084" offset="8495731">But you know that is not all bad, it is a perfectly normal thing for a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.016" offset="8519450">He has explained he was frightened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.979" offset="8527287">That is another explanation for his flight and concealment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2117.165" offset="8572008">Now, it would certainly be a most normal thing -- I would certainly not take exception to the claim that any intelligent person running off like that would sure try and line up some witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.165" offset="8628015">That would be the intelligent thing and not necessarily a meretricious act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.712" offset="8662183">But to contend that a person may involved in a felony and go on, escape for more than two weeks, conceal himself, come back and give a self defense plea when his flight and concealment was certainly in consistent with such a plea, to permit that I say to the Court would certainly handcuff prosecuting authorities throughout this country in many, many cases.</text>
