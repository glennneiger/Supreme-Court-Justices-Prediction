            <text syncTime="54.504" offset="322414">Now, the Court, as far back as Nebbia, has recognized that if one embarks in a business which public interest demands shall be regulated, he must know regulation will ensue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.298" offset="4365542">The first item of business was a stipulation that out of the largest nine shopping centers in Santa Clara County, one was forbidden by local ordinance from permitting the expressive activity, four permitted it, four did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.851" offset="4415801">The stipulation went on that the plaintiffs had conducted a survey of Santa Clara County.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.702" offset="4475256">It's in the face of that that the California Supreme Court's assumption is so egregious, implicit, in that opinion is the assumption that expressive activity is barred from all shopping centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.210" offset="4537219">That's why that fact is so significant which we contend makes this a very narrow case, the existence at great length of the adequate available alternative.</text>
