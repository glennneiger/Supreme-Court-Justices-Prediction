            <text syncTime="531.963" offset="2231254">I would wonder if we're that different from the other states, as I review the Statutes of the other states, beginning on page 33 of my Brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.186" offset="2264168">Now, the way a case normally comes on in North Carolina, whether it's the alimony complaint or the alimony counterclaim, a notice of hearing of the temporary hearing is served and a hearing date is set.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.995" offset="2323310">In our city of Winston-Salem, a city of approximately 170,000 people, there will be approximately 20 hearings a week, exactly of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.656" offset="2370017">We have a special so-to-speak court -- heard in our district courts, but we have a judge assigned to hear these cases 3 days a week, and that's all that that district court judge does.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.227" offset="2424247">It is the extremely rare case, I would say to you -- or circumstances I would say to you where that Statute is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.771" offset="2470431">I might say to you I've been practicing 15 years, and I've never seen the Statute used before it was used in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.172" offset="2504077">Now, a temporary alimony order in North Carolina is a very significant part of the alimony case.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.685" offset="2550157">In our district, and there are approximately 40 districts in North Carolina covering the 100 counties that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.727" offset="2574294">Our district only covers one county because we are one of the larger counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.089" offset="2591744">But in our district, it is normally 12 months or longer before you can receive your jury trial and therefore, whatever is ordered, whether it is $5.00 a week or $5,000 a week or nothing, at the temporary alimony hearing, it has a rather long-lasting effect on the amount of moneys that are paid on settlement negotiations and so on over the next 12 months or what have you until the trial is reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.778" offset="2718490">It is not an order that normally lasts a week or ten days or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.149" offset="2743986">In fact, it is quite to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.490" offset="2809292">Now, there is a part of the Statute, North Carolina General Statute 50-16.9, that states "Upon a showing of substantial change in material circumstances, a party may move the Court to modify or vacate an order."</text>
            <text syncTime="696.799" offset="2890585">Now, what that, number one, would do in this case, assuming that the defendant desired to try to take advantage of 50-16.9, he would have to be the moving party that has filed his motion in court, so notified the other side, and go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.402" offset="2964982">He, and most importantly, I say to you -- would have the burden of proving that there has been a substantial change in material circumstances since the date of the hearing, the date that the order was entered for him to pay alimony without notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.340" offset="3032691">Now, we strongly contend to you that under the law and rationale of numerous cases cited, beginning on page 43 and 44 of our Brief, that the shifting of the burden of proof would not allow what I call bootstrapping or stating that there is inability of the person who has been deprived of due process to come back to court and rectify through his own proof the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.909" offset="3203009">The case of Armstrong v Manso, I believe, is the leading case in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.887" offset="3222967">That is an adoption case where the father was not notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.329" offset="3244701">He did have a right to come into court under statutes claiming that the adoption shouldn't have gone through once he found out about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.778" offset="3278451">But he had the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.084" offset="3287751">Now, our alimony statutes are exactly like that in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.829" offset="3302693">At the initial hearing, the wife has the burden of proving basically two things One is fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.697" offset="3334144">We are a fault state.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.168" offset="3339995">There are 10 grounds for alimony for everything from adultery to excessive use of alcohol to abandonment, indignities, what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.657" offset="3373955">She has to prove, number one, fault and number two, need.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.957" offset="3391195">And then the judge goes into not only her needs, but of course, the abilities of the husband to provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.950" offset="3415124">Those are all things that are supposed to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.525" offset="3425468">The wife, well, defendant spouse, as as our Statute reads but usually the wife has the burden of proving all of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.173" offset="3456084">Fault, need, and ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.334" offset="3464756">She has to prove the husband's ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.892" offset="3474892">He can come to that hearing with affirmative defenses such as her own adultery.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.772" offset="3494431">Or that she is not a dependent spouse in fact, she's a multimillionaire or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.861" offset="3514807">Now, these are all things that are heard at that hearing, and those are who the burden of proof is on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.325" offset="7260662">Several questions are presented here today, of course, for the Court's consideration and the primary one I am concerned with, of course, is the one that's already been raised and that's whether the appellant has met his burden under Street v New York and other established decisions of this Court to raise the issue timely and in a timely fashion, and a clear fashion in the courts below to give those courts, to give opposing counsel an opportunity to respond to those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.219" offset="7368286">Appellee submits that that question has never been properly presented that the burden hasn't been met here today that indeed, it cannot be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.575" offset="7401723">Rule 10(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that each assignment of error shall, so far as practicable, be confined to a single issue of law and shall state plainly and concisely and without argumentation the basis upon which error is assigned and the exceptions not thus listed will be deemed abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.680" offset="7498062">Now, in the grouping of exceptions and assignments of error, the appellant simply stated that the trial court committed prejudicial error in conducting a hearing upon the defendant's motion for temporary alimony in that the defendant had not properly served the answer and counterclaim upon the plaintiff and in that the plaintiff was not given notice of this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.116" offset="7607881">That assignment of error so worded, appellee would contend to the Court, was abandoned or did not raise the constitutional issue of this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1890.748" offset="7666395">Furthermore, Rule 28(a) of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure, dealing with the function and content of briefs, states that the function of all briefs required and permitted to be filed is to define clearly the questions presented to the reviewing court and to present the arguments and authorities upon which the parties rely in support of their respective position thereon.</text>

            <text syncTime="2512.231" offset="10152312">And that, I think, in light of some of the questions asked of Mr. Morrow might bear some clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.767" offset="10178435">Temporary alimony, however entered, is good only during the pendency of the case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.622" offset="10205811">That is, once you have a hearing, a trial on the case in chief on alimony, then all sorts of things can happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.890" offset="10234964">I mean, if you -- if the wife had been given alimony, and you're the husband, and you go to trial, and you win, alimony ceases at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.354" offset="10268818">If you go to trial and you lose, the court could order you to pay an amount less than what you've been paying under the temporary alimony order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.741" offset="10302360">So that the temporary alimony is certainly a -- the ultimate judicial determination is made by trial on the merits involving the alimony question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.570" offset="10365680">And I might also point out that in some ways, a supporting spouse who has been ordered to pay alimony, either with or without notice, is to some extent better off in terms of remedies available to him than, for example, Miss Fuentes was in Fuentes versus Shevin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.498" offset="10461393">All he's got to do, if he is ordered with or without notice to pay temporary alimony, is take final notice of appeal to the North Carolina court of appeals, post a $200 appeal bond and during the pendency of that appeal, the trial court is entirely functus officio as to any enforcement capabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.808" offset="10554598">That is, he can go without paying anything he's been ordered to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.740" offset="10570376">Now, the risk he runs, if he does that, if he loses on appeal then the trial court could, if it so chose, hold him in contempt for not having made the payments during the course of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.919" offset="10627009">If he wins the appeal, of course, he's lost nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.860" offset="11698761">That seems to me what the legislature was trying to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.782" offset="11710464">The legislature said -- and they've done it not only in this statute, they've done it in other statutes we cited there in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.890" offset="11734915">They've given the dependent spouse creditor status for purposes of collection and enforcement of temporary alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.074" offset="11771695">And what they were doing here, whether it was wise or unwise, was attempting to provide some sort of protection and I submit to you that the very wording of the statute makes it clear that that's what they were concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.369" offset="11832822">It was a -- in the words of Mitchell -- debtor acting in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.135" offset="11851943">Whether he was secretly destroying and concealing has assets or whether he was fleeing to Virginia and leaving his wife with no means of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.180" offset="11896142">Whichever one of those things he was doing -- what the legislature in its wisdom or not in its wisdom thought it was doing, was trying to provide some means of protection for a dependent spouse who was dealing with a supporting spouse who was acting in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.785" offset="11974510">I submit to you the facts in this case, the record in this case -- I can't conceive of an individual ever having acted in more bad faith throughout the entire course litigation than the appellant has in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.465" offset="12037204">He's simply thumbed his nose at the courts and disregarded court orders, and simply in effect said I'll do what I want to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.963" offset="12075238">I think not even a close reading -- just a cursory reading of the record, in my opinion, leads one or should lead one to that implication.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.772" offset="12238451">Not -- it was a contempt order that had nothing to do per se with this alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.965" offset="12259244">It had to do -- it was a motion for contempt for his failure to provide his wife visitation with the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.344" offset="12292786">Right about the point that motion was coming up, the appellant fired his attorney who's mentioned in this order, a Mr. Parker, who had been his attorney -- I personally know him -- had been Mr. Fungaroli's attorney all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.563" offset="12349628">He fared that attorney and, at that point, hired, retained Mr. Morrow, or had his father retain Mr. Morrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.501" offset="12381393">He was in town, the father was in town, but the appellant was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.908" offset="12399052">He sent his father down to the show-cause hearing retained Mr. Morrow, and the court granted Mr. Parker's motion to withdraw, and Mr. Morrow then became the appellant's retained counsel at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.237" offset="12488286">I think just to reiterate quickly on Mr. Justice Marshall's observation, there's not a single reference in the brief here on the jurisdictional question, not a single reference to a federal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.450" offset="12529142">I in fact made a mistake in my brief in saying that Morrow cited Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.956" offset="12559235">He in fact didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.059" offset="12563623">What's cited is the 1951 state court case of McLean versus McLean, and there's a lengthy quote from that case in the brief, and the last portion of that quote happens to be a quote within a quote citing Mullane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.140" offset="12619943">So at the point we went to the court of appeals, and as I said before, up really until Mr. Morrow filed his brief with this Court, what we were dealing with there was three -- he cited three North Carolina domestic cases and the citations of Strong's Index.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.591" offset="12681697">Now, literally, I feel like this case contained a federal question once it was filed in the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.190" offset="12752123">In summary, I think, it's our contention that (1) of course that the issue has not been properly presented and for that reason, should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.754" offset="12790366">And that (2), if the Court feels otherwise about that, then the state has reached a perhaps not perfect, but a fair constitutional accommodation of the competing interests of dependent and supporting spouses as well as the legitimate interest of the state and that the statute for that reason should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.617" offset="12877824">If there are no other questions, I really won't take up any more of the Court's time.</text>
