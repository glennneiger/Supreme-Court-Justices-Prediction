            <text syncTime="26.494" offset="209377">If the Court should decide, contrary to our submission, that specific intent is an element of voluntariness, it would still, in our view, have to address the other two questions, namely --</text>

            <text syncTime="36.769" offset="250441">Both of them, although as we say in our brief, we would not defend the constitutionality of the presumption in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.246" offset="276355">But the question would still be whether clear and convincing evidence is required of voluntariness, or whether the statute is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.412" offset="317001">And we presume the Court would address the presumption, even though we don't defend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.995" offset="339362">I think our position is best stated by Chief Justice Warren in his dissent in the Perez case, which as I noted was specifically approved by the Court in Afroyim.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.745" offset="382307">We think that this Court should recognize, as Chief Justice Warren did, and I quote "The principle that conduct of a citizen showing a voluntary transfer of allegiance is an abandonment of citizenship, and thus that any action defined by statute by which the citizen manifests allegiance to a foreign state may be so inconsistent with retention of citizenship as to result in a loss of that status.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.209" offset="488260">"If the conduct described in the statute manifests what Chief Justice Warren called a "dilution of undivided allegiance sufficient to show voluntary abandonment of citizenship," then the Government may give formal recognition to the inevitable consequence of the citizen's own acts without regard to specific intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.040" offset="571538">We submit that taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign government is such conduct.</text>
