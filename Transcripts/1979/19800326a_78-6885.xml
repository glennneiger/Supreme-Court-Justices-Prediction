            <label>Mr. David M. Ebel</label>
            <text syncTime="66.097" offset="367783">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.168" offset="380008">This is a sentencing procedures case and it raises important constitutional questions about the procedures that need to be followed in sentencing defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.291" offset="416580">This is not a case that challenges inherently habitual sentencing statutes, and it is not a case that challenges the excessiveness of a 40-year sentence for a person who commits the kind of crimes that the defendants Hicks has committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.141" offset="479901">Rather, it is a case that challenges the method of imposing that sentence on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.070" offset="503620">Hicks is a young black man.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.290" offset="508531">He was 28 years old at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.343" offset="520756">He and his codefendant were convicted by a jury in Oklahoma of a single sale of heroin worth $50.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.883" offset="550954">Now, Oklahoma has a peculiar statute which says that a defendant in Oklahoma has a right to be sentenced by a jury, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has said that that is a sacred right that may not be lost except by express waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.826" offset="610722">Now, because neither defendant here waived that right, the jury was reconvened to sentence these two defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.841" offset="638725">Hicks' codefendant received the minimum sentence possible under the heroin statute, that is five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.415" offset="669027">Hicks, on the other hand, was charged under the habitual criminal statute in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.427" offset="689089">And I should pause for a minute to tell you that Oklahoma has two habitual criminal statutes, 51(A) and 51(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="154.071" offset="719705">51(B) is a mandatory statute and it says that if you have been convicted of two prior felonies, you must be sentenced to the maximum term permissible under the third offense plus an additional 20 years, and that formula here would calculate to a 40-year sentence for Hicks.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.311" offset="796609">Now, the other statute is 51(A) and that is a discretionary statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.344" offset="816776">That statute says that if you committed one or more prior offenses, that the jury may sentence you to anything it wishes between ten years and life.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.345" offset="860766">Well, at Hicks trial the jury was given evidence of two prior felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.531" offset="885530">Hicks did not challenge that evidence, so the judge instructed the jury that if you find Hicks as guilty of the two prior felonies, you must find him guilty under 51(B) and you must sentence him to 40 years in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.698" offset="946134">The jury listened to those instructions carefully and it followed them and it returned a 40-year mandatory habitual criminal sentence against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.972" offset="983228">Now, while that case was pending on appeal, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals decided a second case that was called Thigpen v. State, and in that case the Oklahoma court held that 51(B) was unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.382" offset="1204851">Well, I think, Your Honor, that that issue isn't directly before this Court because Thigpen was not appealed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.357" offset="1240795">At least when Hicks was sentenced at the Court of Criminal Appeals, I think that Thigpen represented the law as interpreted by Oklahoma, and so for the case at least of Hicks we can assume that 51(B) was improper.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="301.012" offset="1307460">Well, there is a certain abstraction about the whole thing perhaps on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.704" offset="1330239">The Oklahoma legislature passes a statute, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals says it is unconstitutional on federal grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.950" offset="1375169">Say this Court now were in this particular proceeding to conclude that that conclusion was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.091" offset="1411741">The statute is still in existence, it is just two courts have expressed two different opinions as to whether or not it is constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.218" offset="1444237">No, I don't think the statute is in existence any more because it has been declared unconstitutional by a final decision by the state's highest court before this case ever came up here.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.702" offset="1674219">I think that once Thigpen is final and not appealed, that that statute is invalidated because the law changes, it doesn't spring back, all the legislation around the country that might have been stricken under one interpretation of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.200" offset="1788217">We cite in this case both due process and equal protection and Eighth Amendment arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.792" offset="1814549">Because of the shortness of time, I am going to argue primarily the due process case issues here, as I think it is primarily a procedural case.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.251" offset="1856345">Our first due process argument is that Hicks was denied due process when he was sentenced in violation of the state's own laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.930" offset="1891140">Now, there is no doubt that Oklahoma has created a right to be sentenced by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.451" offset="1909217">The Oklahoma statute 926 explicitly says so.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.401" offset="1924995">The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has explicitly said that there is such a right and it is sacred.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.602" offset="1945788">The state in its responsive brief at page 24 acknowledges this fact when it says, "Although the United States Constitution does not mandate the imposition of punishment by a jury, the State of Oklahoma has statutorily created such a right."</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.127" offset="6811878">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.630" offset="6825880">Opposing counsel and myself do not differ on the basic premise that the sentencing stage of a trial proceeding is protected by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.303" offset="6864541">The difference between my position and the position of my opposing counsel is that there is a determination that needs to be made as to what process is due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.936" offset="6915114">The petitioner argues that the failure of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to remand this cause for jury sentencing deprived him of a procedural right under section 926 of the Oklahoma Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.846" offset="6966732">The petitioner has gone through the facts adequately, but I think it is important for this Court to understand exactly what the Court of Criminal Appeals did in Thigpen v. State when it invalidated section 51(B) which was the sentencing provision under which petitioner in this case was sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.635" offset="7037889">The court made a determination and an interpretation upon the basis of the intent of the legislature in this case to provide the progressively greater punishment for the habitual offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.466" offset="7085223">Under 51(B), the punishment was restricted and there was a classification that a second subsequent offender would receive, as in this case forty years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.337" offset="7120750">Had Mr. Hicks been tried under 51(A) he could have received a possible sentence of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.990" offset="7147290">Based upon that premise, the Court of Criminal Appeals did not invalidate the sentencing statute on the basis of a constitutional issue, especially on the basis of due process, but merely that it did not comport with the intent of the legislature to provide for progressively greater punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.335" offset="7208730">Now, the petitioner's entire argument is predicated on the fact that the invalidation of 51(B) completely voided his sentence, and this is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.223" offset="7252302">So long as the sentencing statute contains the severability clause, which in this case it did -- and I must remind this Court that we are not talking about two statutes, we are talking about one that merely said divided two classes of individuals, that being habitual offenders.</text>

            <text syncTime="2682.174" offset="10832018">Basically, all the state is saying is that basic due process requires a hearing on the trial court level, which was given in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.710" offset="10922193">He was entitled to brief his cause and to present errors and his only expectation in the Court of Criminal Appeals was that the court would render a fair and impartial review of his sentence and look for fundamental errors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2812.153" offset="11351960">In conclusion, the respondents, as I said before, submit that the petitioner in this case has been afforded the full panoply of the due process requirements and procedures which the laws of the State of Oklahoma create.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.016" offset="11407444">The Constitution of this country does not provide for a defendant to be resentenced anew.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.194" offset="11428133">It is not a part of the due process clause and is not protected by the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.689" offset="11450180">There can be no possible conceivable relationship between the notice requirements at the trial court level and applying them to the appellate level other than what has been create by state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.178" offset="11496051">The state would submit that there has been notice in all due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.258" offset="11512456">The petitioner also raises questions of equal protection, but this Court in Rummel last week indicated that the state has a right to create classes of individuals under the Habitural Criminal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.401" offset="11549027">I don't feel that there is any suspect classification or any reason -- there is no procedure for anyone sentenced under 51(A) or 51(B) which would violate the procedures of the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.179" offset="11596048">For that reason, the State of Oklahoma asks this Court to affirm the judgment and sentence of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2886.878" offset="11650905">Just three quick comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.510" offset="11661458">I think, although we could leave it to the Court of Criminal Appeals to decide whether they could remand this to a jury or not, I think there is precedent for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.735" offset="11694268">It is a case we cite in our brief, the Epperson v. State case, where I think the Court of Criminal Appeals did just that.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2904.002" offset="11719346">Well, if we agree with you, counsel, presumably what we would do is be to vacate the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals and remand the case to that court and let it decide what it wants to do about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2914.905" offset="11763022">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.749" offset="11770337">The second point is our discussion about the power of the Court of Criminal Appeals to modify sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.508" offset="11797400">That has always been interpreted under the Oklahoma law as the power to modify the length of the sentence when it is excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.950" offset="11823208">Obviously, they didn't feel this sentence here was excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.033" offset="11835538">To my knowledge, that statute has never authorized the Court of Criminal Appeals to modify the basis for which the sentence was issued, to modify the statute under which he was tried, to change the statutory basis entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.266" offset="11888410">Finally, in response to Justice Rehnquist's question, if Mr. Justice Rehnquist will review again the petition for rehearing, the petitioner here, specifically in the petition for rehearing, Your Honor, did complain about being sentenced under federal constitutional grounds by the Court of Criminal Appeals and did ask to have that matter remanded for sentencing in accordance with state law.</text>
