            <label>Mr. J. Terry Wiggins</label>
            <text syncTime="85.569" offset="445628">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.551" offset="461615">This matter comes on for review of this Court as the result of the conviction of Otis Trammel, Jr., the petitioner herein, for aiding and abetting the importation of heroin from the Philippines into Hawaii and the United States and for conspiring with others, approximately nine persons named in the original indictment, for the importation of heroin into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.749" offset="554402">It resulted from the arrest of Elizabeth Trammel on November 6, 1975 in Hawaii as she entered the country carrying a substantial quantity of heroin on a trip in from Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.420" offset="621066">At the time of Mrs. Trammel's arrest, she was alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.907" offset="634964">She was told that she was charged with a serious felony and she was offered the voluntary opportunity of cooperating with the government in exchange for being charged with a misdemeanor and a recommendation of probation or, in the alternative, being jailed for the felony for which she had been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.886" offset="710928">She elected the latter alternative and indicated that she would cooperate with the government, notifying the Customs agents at that time that she intended to take the heroin to Colorado, to deliver it to an individual by the name of Roberts who was then stationed in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.006" offset="791385">That was done under a controlled circumstances and at the first statement given by Mrs. Trammel to the Customs authorities in the Drug Enforcement Administration at that time, she did not in any way implicate the petitioner here, Otis Trammel.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.475" offset="853243">After the controlled delivery took place in Denver, Colorado, and Mr. Roberts was arrested together with a Mr. Richardson, Mrs. Trammel was sent on at that time and still told that her cooperation would be necessary and in exchange for her cooperation she was being offered a misdemeanor and a recommendation of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.110" offset="935790">She was again interviewed at Denver and at that time once again she did not implicate her husband, the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.631" offset="965883">Finally, approximately a month to six weeks after Mrs. Trammel's arrest, she was interviewed in Birmingham, Alabama, which was her family home, at that time she implicated her husband as the part of an importation conspiracy and as an aider and abettor to the initial importation for which she had been caught and she was notified once again that she would have -- that her cooperation with the government would be recognized and that she would receive leniency for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.113" offset="1127842">You spent considerable time pointing out the fact that she took a while to consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.083" offset="1155741">I didn't see how that was directly involved with the legal principle.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Terry Wiggins</label>
            <text syncTime="265.942" offset="1167130">Well, I think it is involved with the legal principle is the principle that the government tries in their brief and I assume by argument here today to convince this Court that there should be an exception to the husband-wife privilege, that being the voluntary consent of the witness spouse or one of the parties to the marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.058" offset="1235571">If that were to be an exception, it seems to me that voluntariness becomes a serious question and her voluntariness is certainly subject to consideration when she is in two prior interviews does not notify the authorities of his participation and only ultimately, with all of the offers on the table, she finally agrees to or she talks about him and agrees to testify against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.142" offset="1343927">It is hard to call that in my estimation voluntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.907" offset="1379035">I think she had neglected to mention him in the earlier interviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.735" offset="1390320">She mentioned more people as time went by apparently to get a better deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.092" offset="1407770">The ultimate deal she got is she was not charged with any crime nor convicted of anything; in fact, she was given witness immunity in exchange for her testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.318" offset="1436609">Well, in ordinary plea negotiation situation, Mr. Wiggins, where there is no husband and wife problem or the testimonial aspect you have here, do you regard the testimony of the witness who cooperates with the government as involuntary?</text>

            <text syncTime="473.849" offset="1998764">Not entirely, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.012" offset="2003466">I have seen people granted immunity who didn't want it and would just as soon have stood trial and who opted for contempt as opposed to willingness to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.966" offset="2047248">That has happened and that is a circumstance where a person didn't want it but nonetheless the result is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.579" offset="2101687">Some two months after Mrs. Trammel or three months after Mrs. Trammel was caught entering the United States with heroin, the defendants were indicted, three defendants were indicted and six persons were named as unindicted co-conspirators in this case in count two which was conspiracy to import heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.788" offset="2174516">Prior to the trial of the lawsuit, the matter was here before the court and husband-wife privilege was raised by a motion to suppress, requesting the District Court judge - a motion to sever, excuse me, requesting the District Court judge to sever Mr. Trammel from the other two defendants who were then charged so that Mr. Trammel could claim his privilege in an independent trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.138" offset="2271901">The whole point of the hearing, however, was strictly the privilege question and at that time the District Court judge refused to recognize that such a privilege existed and the government argued that no such privilege existed and the District Court judge indicated that Mrs. Trammel would in fact be required to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.125" offset="2335848">Subsequently, within approximately three days, the trial began.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.622" offset="2357896">Mrs. Trammel was called to testify, a motion and order granting immunity were given her, and again the petitioner, Mr. Trammel, raised the question of the husband-wife privilege and once again the court said that the ruling of the court would be the same and basically not recognizing the privilege, only recognizing a communications privilege and noting that the communications privilege would be fully enforced and that she would not be able to testify to privileged communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.237" offset="2492270">In addition, at the time that this matter was argued before the United Sates Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the government once again, according to the Circuit Court's opinion, took the position that the privilege that I am here to argue today just didn't exist in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.335" offset="2560711">The Circuit Court of Appeals found that the privilege did in fact exist but took the position that because of the fact that she was a co-participant or a co-conspirator in the case, and also because of the fact that she was granted witness immunity, that she should have been permitted to testify and that it did not violate the precedent set forth in Hawkins v. United States, which is the last case in which this Court came face-to-face with the privilege that is before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.629" offset="2745866">In the Hawkins case, the Court held, this Court has held that the privilege was an absolute one, of one spouse to keep the other spouse off the witness stand and that that privilege took precedence over, in the case of Hawkins at least, the conviction of Mr. Hawkins, his wife was called to testify against him and who was, I think it is clearly arguable from the case and clearly notable within the case, that his wife was herself a co-participant at least to the degree that she was running the house of prostitution to which the young lady being transported across state lines was to go at the conclusion of the trip and may well have been an aider and abettor, may well have been a co-conspirator in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="737.415" offset="3053066">At any rate, Hawkins made the privilege -- it is my position an absolute privilege, the government argued at that time the same thing that the government argues before this Court in its brief now, that the privilege should reside in the witness spouse rather than the defendant spouse, and that the witness should be the one to make a voluntary determination as to whether or not he or she should testify when his or her spouse is accused and on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.165" offset="3160064">This Court rejected that argument in Hawkins, and I urge that it be rejected again.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.035" offset="3179499">I would also note that it is clear from the legislative history of the rules of evidence that this Court took the position in approximately 1974 when the rules of evidence were being considered by the Congress, this Court sent up rules of evidence and the husband and wife privilege sent up by the Advisory Committee was identical to the privilege that is presently set out in Hawkins.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.161" offset="4996054">I think I agree very strongly with the statement that it was Mr. Justice Black's opinion at that time that it would destroy almost any marriage for one of the marriage partners to be called as a witness against the other, and I think that is true regardless of the outcome of the trial of the case, because it seems to me if a spouse stands up and testifies in open court against his or her mate, that the marriage is probably at that point irretrievably shattered and would not return to any semblance of trust between the two as a result of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.323" offset="5144639">So I think that the situation that Mr. Justice Black suggests early on, I think that is still the same situation today.</text>
