            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="69.961" offset="383248">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.122" offset="395891">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.944" offset="419192">The respondents were charged in a 12-count indictment with unlawful possession of stolen mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.925" offset="443120">The indictment was based on twelve checks that had been stolen from the United States mails and that were determined to bear respondents' fingerprints.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.904" offset="474990">These checks, along with more than 700 other stolen checks, were seized by Massachusetts State Police officers during their search pursuant to a state warrant of an apartment rented by respondent Zackular's mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.423" offset="533086">The indictment alleged that respondents unlawfully possessed this stolen mail from late 1975 to on or about December 17, 1976, the date on which the search occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.297" offset="588570">Prior to trial, the respondents moved to suppress the checks because the affidavit submitted in support of the application for the search warrant failed to show probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.583" offset="629739">The District Court granted their motion and ordered suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.615" offset="645831">The government then sought reconsideration of the suppression order on the ground that the respondents lacked standing to challenge the search of the mother's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.037" offset="679476">The government's motion for reconsideration argued that respondents had neither a sufficient proprietary or possessory interest in a property seized or premises searched to contest the validity of the search, nor automatic standing under Jones v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.589" offset="745723">The respondents filed a memorandum in opposition to this motion in which they relied solely on a claim of automatic standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.277" offset="776443">Following submission of the government's memorandum, the District Court by a handwritten notation on the face of the government's motion reaffirmed the suppression order.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.452" offset="813223">On the government's appeal, the First Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.820" offset="826702">With respect to the issue of standing, it found that the respondents had no actual standing to contest the lawfulness of the search because they had not established a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises searched or the property seized or claimed the proprietary or possessory interest in the premises or the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.878" offset="906846">Nevertheless, the court held the respondents could challenge the search based on the automatic standing rule of Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.030" offset="935476">Although it recognized that this Court had questioned the continued vitality of the automatic standing doctrine and that there was a split of authority in the lower courts on the issue, the Court of Appeals felt obligated to adhere to the Jones rule until this Court resolved the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.743" offset="1006320">We submit that the Jones automatic standing rule should now be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.445" offset="1025128">Under Jones, a defendant automatically has standing to contest a search that leads to the seizure of evidence where possession of the seized evidence at the time of the search is an essential element of the offense with which he is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.989" offset="1083329">Automatic standing turns solely on the nature of the charge brought by the prosecutor and it enables a defendant to obtain the suppression of reliable and probative evidence even though his own constitutional rights were not implicated in the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.906" offset="1142993">In this way, automatic standing is inconsistent with the well settled principle that the exclusionary rule can be invoked only by a defendant who has demonstrated that his personal Fourth Amendment rights have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.992" offset="1203388">The Court in Jones found that cases involving possessory offenses presented a special problem that for two reasons warranted departure from the conventional principles of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.780" offset="1250513">First was the self-incrimination dilemma in which the defendant was confronted with either foregoing the assertion of his Fourth Amendment claim or, in order to establish standing, giving incriminating testimony as an admission could be used in the government's case in chief to prove his guilt at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.486" offset="1333269">As this Court observed in Brown v. United States, this self-incrimination dilemma can no longer occur in light of the subsequent decision in Simmons v. United States that a defendant's testimony at a suppression hearing cannot be introduced as part of the prosecutor's direct case at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.451" offset="1405158">We believe that Brown correctly concluded that the self-incrimination dilemma is no longer an issue after Simmons.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="334.013" offset="1439431">So there is no issue here about other grounds for standing here, such as an interest in the premises or being a guest on the premises?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="347.136" stopTime="417.840">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="347.136" offset="1491884">There is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.628" offset="1493870">The respondents were not present at the time of the search and they have never in the course of this proceeding asserted that they had any basis for actual standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.948" offset="1523127">Indeed, respondent Zackular in his brief in the Court of Appeals and in this Court I think expressly concedes that they have no actual standing, and there is nothing in the record to support the claim of actual standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.340" offset="1572760">Hence, as the Court recognized in Brown, the continued validity of the automatic standing rule rests solely on the second rationale in Jones, the so-called vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction whereby the government alleges the defendants' possession as an essential element of the defense charge but denies that there was possession sufficient to establish the defendants' standing to contest the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.049" offset="1675577">In our view, the automatic standing rule cannot be justified on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.014" offset="1695431">It is not inherently contradictory for the government to charge a defendant with a possessory offense based on his culpable conduct prescribed by the penal code and at the same time to contend that he had no legitimate expectation of privacy that was implicated by the search that uncovered the illegally possessed items.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.840" offset="1774738">Mr. Levy, it is actually the defendant that brings a suppression motion, not the government, isn't it?</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="424.946" offset="1803160">So the government is just advancing arguments as to why the suppression motion shouldn't be granted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="431.443" stopTime="441.538">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="431.443" offset="1829177">I believe that is correct, and I think the holding of Jones is that the government is foreclosed from contesting the suppression motion on the ground that the defendant didn't have standing to raise it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="441.538" stopTime="443.295">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="441.538" offset="1869511">Does that really make much sense?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="443.295" stopTime="575.802">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="443.295" offset="1876511">We don't believe that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.211" offset="1888214">This is most clearly illustrated in cases where the defendant is charged not with actual possession at the time of the search but rather is charged with constructive or vicarious possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.627" offset="1949863">For example, a defendant who exercises dominion or control over contraband, even though it is not in his actual possession, has engaged in conduct that the criminal law rightly condemns and he is subject to prosecution for a possessory offense under a theory of constructive possession, but that fact standing alone is not tantamount to a concession by the government that the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were affected by the search of a third party's premises or property in which he had no legitimate expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.585" offset="2081729">For example, consider a defendant who without permission conceals contraband narcotics on the property of a stranger with the intention later to reclaim the drugs and sell them.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.945" offset="2131153">If the police illegally enter and search the third party's property and seize the narcotics, it can hardly be thought that the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were infringed for he had no reasonable privacy interest in the place that was illegally searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.033" offset="2195519">In these circumstances, it would be fully proper for the government to charge the defendant with unlawful possession at the time of the search and yet object to his standing to seek the suppression of evidence on the basis of the illegal search.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.400" offset="2252988">Another example suggested by the decision in Rakas v. Illinois in which the Court held that the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated by the illegal search of the car in which they were riding.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.136" offset="2299904">The defendants in Rakas were charged with armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.168" offset="2312025">If, however, they had been prosecuted and convicted with the unlawful constructive possession of the rifle that was found during the course of the search, it is difficult to see that their suppression claim would be enhanced in the slightest or that the government would be acting in a contradictory fashion by prosecuting on that charge while denying that the defendants could challenge the search under the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="575.802" offset="2406588">Mr. Levy, could I ask you a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.657" offset="2414007">Suppose the defendants in this case contended that the checks had been duly endorsed over to him or some such claim pursuant to which he claimed some rightful entitlement to the checks, would he have standing (a) to ask for their return, and (b) to object to the search in the third party's premises?</text>

            <text syncTime="728.392" offset="3016913">-- or if the police were entitled to seize something temporarily as a means of protection but they retained the item longer than was necessary, there might be some grounds for challenging the seizure itself apart from the search that led to the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.402" offset="3080965">One way to see we think the absence of any prosecutorial self-contradiction in the automatic standing situations is to ask whether the defendant would be entitled to pursue applicable remedies other than the exclusionary rule such as a damage action for the assertedly unconstitutional search.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.148" offset="3155989">We think it plain that in the hypotheticals I mentioned a few moments ago that the defendant would not be awarded monetary damages since his Fourth Amendment rights were not violated by the illegal search.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.066" offset="3199666">For the same reason, he should not be able to invoke the exclusionary rule remedy, and that conclusion is independent of the nature of the charges brought against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.359" offset="3240835">Thus, we think that the Jones rationale or prosecutorial self-contradiction does not support the continuation of the automatic standing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.621" offset="3277824">Apart from the two rationales of Jones itself, the respondent, Salvucci, contends in his brief that the automatic standing rule can be justified by reference to principles of actual standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.080" offset="3327666">Salvucci argues that a defendant's possessory interest in contraband that is seized entitles him without more to seek suppression of that evidence on the ground that the underlying search violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.000" offset="3383359">Salvucci then argues that the charging of a possessory offense necessarily constitutes an admission by the government that the defendant has the requisite possessory interest in the seized contraband to enable him to challenge the search and therefore that the automatic standing rule should be retained to avoid the needless formality of an inquiry into standing at the suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.383" offset="3476877">We submit that this line of argument is entirely unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.239" offset="3492342">In our view, as I just discussed with Mr. Justice Stevens, a defendant's proprietary or possessory interest in items seized does not in and of itself entitle him to contest the validity of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.895" offset="3538944">Moreover, regardless of the general rule, an asserted possessory interest in contraband, such as stolen property, is totally illegitimate and cannot served as the basis for a Fourth Amendment challenge to either a search or a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.675" offset="3594115">Finally, even if a possessory interest in contraband could suffice to confer standing with respect to the search, the automatic standing rule still would not be warranted, since not all possessory interests should be considered adequate but rather only those interests that establish a sufficient personal nexus between the seized contraband and the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.985" offset="3683349">First, a defendant's proprietary or possessory interest in the items seized does not in itself entitle him to challenge the legality of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.248" offset="3724413">Salvucci's argument to the contrary reflects a misconception of the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and unreasonable seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.674" offset="3762030">A search is defined under the Fourth Amendment in terms of a governmental intrusion upon a person's legitimate expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.154" offset="3795989">It depends not on a property right but, rather, on a reasonable privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.740" offset="3818350">A seizure of a physical object, on the other hand, is defined in terms of a governmental interference with the bundle of property rights that attends a person's interest in or relation to that object.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.923" offset="3867042">It implicates precisely those property rights that a person has by virtue of his ownership or possession of a given object.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.625" offset="3901837">Under this analysis, a proprietary or possessory interest in items seized could give rise to standing to challenge the validity of the seizure, since it was the act of seizure that dispossessed the defendant of his property.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.074" offset="4039659">The government here is not asserting that as items seized it is a transfer of title to the government if it was an item that the defendant was entitled to own, but rather than the government is entitled to temporary possession for use of the item in the criminal proceeding against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.678" offset="4098069">I think it is a different problem than a taking issue that might be posed in other circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.634" offset="4133909">The defendant's interest in his property, however, even if allowing him to challenge the seizure, would not entitle him to challenge the antecedent search of a third party's premises in which by hypothesis the defendant has no legitimate expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.568" offset="4197648">Nor can standing be based on the proposition that a defendant has a cognizable privacy interest in a place simply because his property is kept there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.203" offset="4236204">We acknowledge that in some circumstances a defendant who stores his property in the premises of a third party may have a sufficient privacy interest in those premises to challenge a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.861" offset="4282807">On the other hand, not all such uses of a third party's premises would demonstrate a privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.311" offset="4312586">For instance, if the defendant illegally entered someone's home and without the knowledge or permission of the owner concealed incriminating evidence in the basement, he should not be heard to complain that his reasonable expectation of privacy was infringed if the police unlawfully search the basement for that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.923" offset="4383013">Likewise, if the defendant simply asks a third party briefly to keep something for him, without any understanding as to the particular location of where it would be kept or the need for it to be securely and privately stored, then we doubt that the defendant has an expectation of privacy in the place where the third party eventually decides to put the object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.272" offset="4464410">In these cases, the pertinent inquiry is not whether the defendant had a proprietary or possessory interest in the items that were seized but whether taking into account all relevant considerations, including his use of the area to store his belongings, the defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy with respect to the area searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.653" offset="4546017">The fact that the defendant's property was legitimately on the third party's premises does not by itself give him a privacy interest in those premises, just as in Rakas the defendant's legitimate presence in the car that was searched did not by itself entitle him to challenge the legality of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.486" offset="4633266">We do not think that the decisions of this Court compel different analysis than the government presents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.856" offset="4662836">In particular, we do not read United States v. Jeffers to be a contrary holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.404" offset="4688959">We believe that the defendant's standing in Jeffers was based on his interest in the hotel room that was searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.784" offset="4714559">He had a key to that room, he had permission to use the room at will, and in fact he often entered for various purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.914" offset="4742980">This was clearly an adequate ground on which to find standing, and we don't think that the Court's opinion in Jeffers is best understood to rest on a possessory interest in the items that were seized.</text>
