            <text syncTime="16.882" offset="170924">Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.967" offset="183254">This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.742" offset="198301">It involves a question of whether the State of Arizona can impose a transaction privilege tax on the sale of 11 tractors to the Gila River Indian Community.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.255" offset="236440">In 1973, representatives of Central Machinery went upon the Gila River Indian Reservation for the purpose of selling farm machinery to Gila River Farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.762" offset="278444">Gila River Farms is a subsidiary and business enterprise of the Gila River Indian Community, a recognized Indian Tribe, organized pursuant to Section 16 of the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.059" offset="327659">After negotiations which occurred on the reservation, Gila River Farms agreed to purchase 11 John Deere tractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.795" offset="362559">Subsequently, delivery and payment for the tractors was made on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.966" offset="387218">Central Machinery added to the purchase price the amount of $2916.62 which was paid by Gila River Farms to Central Machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.927" offset="431104">Central Machinery remitted these funds to the State of Arizona as payment for the transaction privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.658" offset="466004">Central Machinery paid this tax under protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.158" offset="488051">The sale was approved by the Superintendent of Pima agency, the Secretary's representative on the Gila River Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.983" offset="523264">The Pima agency Superintendent allowed Central Machinery to come onto the reservation and transact this business without securing a trader's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.279" offset="564537">The Superintendent, prior to the sale, had also approved the Farms' budget which had set aside moneys for the purchase of the tractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.822" offset="598706">Administrative appeals and court action in the Arizona courts followed, culminating in this appeal before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.537" offset="637471">The trader statute, U.S.C. 261-264, and federal regulations preempt Arizona's jurisdiction to levy this tax on this sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.409" offset="685014">It is our position that Warren Trading Post governs this case, thereby, preventing application or imposition of the transaction privilege tax, a tax which is measured by sales to this sales transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.395" offset="736946">Mr. Lewis, would you agree that if, instead of the transaction taking place on the Gila River Reservation, it had taken place in New Mexico and Arizona had sought to levy its privilege tax, it would be taxable?</text>

            <text syncTime="177.239" offset="812283">I am not sure whether or not there would be a sufficient connection to the State of Arizona, allowing Arizona to impose that tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.063" offset="919594">I don't think the licensing by the Interior is dispositive in this case nor do I think it would be handled the same way regarding a transaction in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.219" offset="964211">We're -- our position is that Warren Trading Post, which held that federal statutes and accompanying regulations preempted the field, did not allow the -- did not allow the imposition of this tax to this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.881" offset="1042892">Warren Trading Post held that -- that Congress has undertaken to regulate reservation trading in such a comprehensive way that there's no room for the States to legislate the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.756" offset="1094405">Any assessment and collection of a tax involved here was held in Warren to frustrate the evident congressional purpose of ensuring that no burden be imposed upon Indian traders, trading with Indians or reservations, except as authorized by Acts of Congress or by valid regulations promulgated under those Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.163" offset="1191999">Congress enacted the trader statute to deter fraud and prevent exploitation of Indians engaged in commercial transaction with an Indian country.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.818" offset="1494601">He was aware, of course, that the tax had been paid under protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.890" offset="1526888">The power of Congress to legislate in this area stems from the Indian Commerce Clause, Article III, Section 8, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.961" offset="1567222">On their face, these statutes indicate that exclusive power to regulate trading rest with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.099" offset="1595747">For instance, 25 U.S.C. 261 says that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs has sole power and authority to appoint Indian traders.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.419" offset="1637021">25 U.S.C. 262 specifies that any person must first satisfy the Commissioner that he is a proper person to deal with -- to trade with Indians.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rodney B. Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="471.778" offset="1990510">The Federal Government has traditionally and historically regulated trading involving Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.990" offset="2015378">Beginning in 1790, it enacted the trader statutes, and throughout the 19th century, the trader statutes were amended from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.439" offset="2065115">Because of this predominant federal interest, state regulation has often been precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.273" offset="2096462">The sale by Central Machinery to Gila River Farms falls within the scope of the trader statute and the holding of Warren Trading Post, 25 U.S.C. for instance, 264 penalizes any person conducting unauthorized trading with Indians or Indian tribes and the Commissioner has issued comprehensive regulations to carry out the objectives of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.254" offset="2212342">The attempt to attack this -- the sale of these tractors to Gila River Farms which occurred on the reservation must follow since the trader statutes preempt Arizona's jurisdiction to enact this tax and because of the holding -- the interpretation of the trader statutes by Warren Trading Post.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.380" offset="2312861">Our second argument deals with the fact that the tax interferes with the federal purposes of the Gila River Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.878" offset="2350895">The reservation was established in 1859 to provide Pimas and Maricopas a sound economic base.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.024" offset="2379421">Gila River Farms is pursuing this objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.166" offset="2392064">Pimas and Maricopas have farmed along the Gila River for hundreds and even thousands of years, certainly before the establishment of the American Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.514" offset="2429471">Imposition of the Arizona transaction privilege -- privilege tax burdens the economic purpose of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.670" offset="2462072">Second of all, the tax interferes with tribal self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.790" offset="2478582">Warren invalidated the same tax in 1965, this tax which -- which is measured by sales, because it -- in part because it interfered with tribal self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.909" offset="2522990">And McClanahan invalidate Arizona's income tax because of its interference with tribal self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.442" offset="2553187">The Gila River Indian -- Indian Community's ability to govern itself will likewise be interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.182" offset="2592057">I would like to now address two arguments raised by the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.092" offset="2619747">First -- and -- and the Arizona Supreme Court thought it important that because of the lack of trader's license, this transaction did not come within the trader statutes or the holding in Warren.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.537" offset="2677530">First of all, there is not a statutory requirement that Central Machinery have a trader's license to engage in trading on a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.132" offset="2719848">The purpose of these statutes, as I mentioned before, is to supervise trading with Indians and Indian tribes to prevent unfair prices and practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.888" offset="2758928">Issuance of a trader's license is not the exclusive way in which or method in which the Federal Government uses to accomplish the purpose of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.806" offset="2802604">For instance, the Code of Federal Regulations allows peddlers to go onto the reservations to trade for limited purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.145" offset="2843982">Therefore, they need correspondingly less supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.209" offset="2860178">Here, there was extensive supervision which met the objectives of the statutes, that is, to deter fraud and prevent exploitation of Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.575" offset="7405693">And those States, the State of New York, the State of Massachusetts, had Indian enclaves within them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1847.962" offset="7495241">The question in this case, it seems to us, is whether the exclusive constitutional power of Congress to deal with Indian tribes includes, as the constitutional language itself suggests, commercial relations between the White world and the Indian world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.875" offset="7578833">It seems to us that that was a matter that was confined by the Constitution to the Congress duly exercised in the Non-Intercourse Acts but not entirely dependent on that exercise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1913.535" offset="7757511">My name is Ian Macpherson and I represent the appellees in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.796" offset="7774542">I think, at the outset, what I'd like to do is point out a couple of facts that were raised in the opening remarks by both counsel for the taxpayer and the United States as amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.232" offset="7828250">Mr. Lewis, on behalf of the taxpayer, has stated in -- in his opening remarks that there was an extensive regulation and supervision of the purchase of these tractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.807" offset="7894601">A further examination of the facts will reveal, and the record supports this, as a matter of fact, it was stipulated in the agreed statement of facts upon which the matter was submitted to the Superior Court on cross-motion for summary judgment, that, in addition to the visible economic burden of the Arizona transaction privilege tax, Central Machinery Company included as well, as an undifferentiated cost component the economic burdens of many of its other state taxes, that is, Central Machinery Company, it being a non-Indian Arizona corporation engaged in business within the State of Arizona at Casa Grande, Arizona, which this Court may take note of and it's stipulated in the facts, is not located within any reservation whatsoever, is subject itself to a number of other state taxes, state income taxes, state property taxes, so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.991" offset="8127300">The economic burdens of those taxes, to be distinguished of course from the legal incidence of the taxes, were blended in to the purchase price of all of the tractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.393" offset="8172962">Those undifferentiated cost burdens were approved in the purchase order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.668" offset="8194069">And I think at this point, it's important to note that the purchase order itself was approved on February 22nd of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.353" offset="8232835">The purchase order listed not only the individual tractors with an individual price for each tractor, but also a grand total for the total of the 11 tractors, some $97,000 plus the visible economic burden of some $2900 for the Arizona transaction privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.898" offset="8314964">That purchase order was submitted to the Superintendent of the Pima agency, that agent who has authority over this particular reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.536" offset="8357491">If the argument be made that there was an -- an extensive supervision of the purchase, the fact is, the record is barren of any indication other than that, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs or his delegate, the Superintendent of the Pima agency approved it, simply rubberstamped the purchase order that was put in front of him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.277" offset="8492492">The Gila River -- Gila River Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Pima agent, I believe, out of Tucson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.044" offset="8527600">In any event, with respect to the argument that 25 U.S.C. 81 governs the result in this case, notwithstanding the fact that Central Machinery had neither an Indian trader's license nor an itinerant peddler's permit, that Section 81 applies, that is the general power to approve contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.646" offset="8617984">The fact of the matter is that the Pima agent did not reject that cost that was included with the purchase order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.059" offset="8659571">He specifically approved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.568" offset="8669602">Now, with respect to the Warren Trading Post case, that fact situation fits precisely into the opinion rendered by Assistant Solicitor Harper in 58 I.D. 562, upon which this Court relied and cited with approval in the Warren Trading Post case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.905" offset="8751000">In that particular Interior Department opinion, it was specifically provided that, where a purchase order is issued to a merchant doing business off the reservation, they are subject to state taxes including, if the Court please, those purchases which relate to items, goods, whatever for a specific program of Indian development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.088" offset="8867715">In doing so, Assistant Solicitor Harper overruled a prior provision in 57 I.D. 124.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.601" offset="8901778">Previously, the opinion of the Interior Department had been that these purchases, being for Indian development and in view of the “confused state of the law at the time”, were felt at that time not by Solicitor Harper but, rather, Mr. Corgis, Assistant Solicitor Corgis, to be except from state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.502" offset="9001357">In 58 I.D. 562, on the other hand, Solicitor Harper specifically points out that, based upon this Court's decision in cases, among others, James v. Dravo, the Penn Dairies case, these are all included within the Interior Department opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.298" offset="9072515">That, in fact, it now, that is in 1943, some-three years after the rendition of a prior opinion, it appeared that based on this Court's rulings in interstate commerce cases, James v. -- or federal immunity cases that the mere fact that the economic burdens of some state taxes might be borne by the Federal Government was not in itself enough to infringe upon the immunity of the ultimate sovereign in this nation, the United States Government itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2816.747" offset="11370350">There'd been no mandate of state law to transfer the obligation for the tax, that is the legal liability for the tax to the vendee in Arizona, the legal liability remaining by mandate of state law upon the non-Indian Central Machinery Company off the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.927" offset="11463032">And again, the taxable event being not the sale but engaging in business within Arizona.</text>

            <text syncTime="2914.641" offset="11761977">Well, if I may, by way of further explanation, the fact of the matter is that Arizona believes, after an examination not only of the Warren Trading Post decision but the Warren Trading Post briefs and indeed, the tape of the oral argument in the Warren Trading Post decision, maintains that these taxes are not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.636" offset="11869915">They are not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.035" offset="11879528">Indeed, some 40 or 50 minutes into the tape, counsel for Warren Trading Post at oral argument conceded, and this again gets into the question of the Buck Act, that if the Buck Act applied to Indian reservations, he would have no case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.463" offset="11941177">He would have no case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2961.497" offset="11949328">That aside, the point is that Warren Trading Post, as it stands right now is distinguishable from the facts that we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3098.724" offset="12498317">The fact of the matter is that, under Warren Post, as it stands right now, a condition precedent to Central Machinery Company's opening a branch office as it were on the reservation is the application for and acquisition of a federal Indian trader's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.330" offset="12556727">There's no exception in the statute that I can see that says that “Well, we don't need a license because, somehow, we are otherwise regulated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.201" offset="12592149">There's no exception like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.095" offset="12595702">As a matter of fact, the dissenting opinion of Justice Lockwood in the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in the Warren Trading Post case which this course -- Court, of course, overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.183" offset="12632064">Justice Lockwood specifically said that the reason that this is preempted is because Warren Trading Post had acquired a federal Indian trader's license, was in compliance with the federal statutes, was extensively and pervasively regulated and therefore, preemption must apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.553" offset="12709595">Indeed, that same rationale is advanced by Warren Trading Post in the oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.847" offset="12730807">As a matter of fact and of note, at least interest to the State of Arizona, is the fact that Central Machinery Company, in their reply brief, makes reference to Complete Auto Transit v. Brady, this Court's decision in Complete Auto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.761" offset="12782425">Fact of the matter is that one of the rulings, perhaps the major ruling in Complete Auto Transit, is the overruling of Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.631" offset="12821922">Spector Motor Service v.O'Connor was the cornerstone case in Warren Trading Post's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.224" offset="12852224">Warren Trading Post did not initially advance, as its primary argument, preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.531" offset="12877511">What it argued was that, under Spector, there is a prohibition upon state taxes, upon the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce and because of that prohibition in Spector, the State of Arizona did not have jurisdiction to impose the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.700" offset="12950131">That's the same rationale, at least to that point, that the New Mexico Supreme Court went through in Your Food Stores v. Espanola.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.961" offset="12979179">Well, we have attempted in our brief to trace the history and underlying facts surrounding the Your Food Stores decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.977" offset="13027244">We also point out that the -- the question of whether or not a State may impose a privilege tax on the business of engaging in interstate commerce, this Court has resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.822" offset="13078653">That's what Complete Auto Transit does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.868" offset="13086804">Now, if the argument is being made that somehow, Complete Auto Transit is relevant for purposes of saying that we can't do this, that a State's determination, as to the nature of its tax, are not binding upon this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.307" offset="13148557">The fact remains that this Court has held that a state court's determination as to the nature of its tax, as opposed to where the legal incidence falls, at least in federal contexts, and we have footnoted this Court's prior decisions in First Agricultural Bank and most recently, Diamond National.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.770" offset="13222431">That's a distinct consideration from the question of the state -- the highest state court's determination as to the nature of its tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.576" offset="13253674">Arizona's Supreme Court has consistently, since 1935, when the transaction privilege tax was initially enacted, has construed it to be a transaction privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.371" offset="13292857">It is not a sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.657" offset="13306023">Furthermore, the Warren Trading Post case is distinguishable because the area that has been preempted under Warren Trading Post is not commerce with Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.159" offset="13344057">Moe establishes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.369" offset="13352835">The area that has been preempted is engaging in the business of Indian trading on an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.639" offset="13385958">Again, an examination of the oral argument in Warren Trading Post, it does not appear from the record, it doesn't appear in the Warren Trading Post briefs, but an examination of the tape will reveal that some 95%, 95% of the sales of Warren Trading Post Company were with Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.775" offset="13454503">This is the only transaction, so far as we know, that transpired between Central Machinery Company and the Gila River Farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.456" offset="13497240">Based upon those facts, if it please the Court, it strikes Arizona as being somewhat curious to characterize Central Machinery Company as being engaged in the business of Indian trading on an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.894" offset="13550947">They're not Indian traders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.158" offset="13555963">Furthermore, they're not itinerant peddlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.624" offset="13565889">They're not -- they don't fall within the class that is entitled to hold either an itinerant peddler's permit or an Indian trader's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.601" offset="13605804">We, furthermore, maintain that with respect to these arguments of infringement with tribal self-government, the decisions of this -- well, state court decisions in which this Court has denied or dismissed the appeal for lack of substantial federal question, the Kahn case and the Makah case are both highly relevant, particularly Makah.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.072" offset="13699636">In Makah, the Washington cigarette tax was involved and the taxable activity, taxable event took place off the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.940" offset="13735163">There was an increase in the price to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.948" offset="13743208">Nevertheless, the tax was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.020" offset="13755434">The Court decided the decision in the Minot case in support of that result, and this Court dismissed.</text>
