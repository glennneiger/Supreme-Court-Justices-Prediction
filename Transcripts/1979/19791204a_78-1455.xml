            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear arguments first this morning in United States against Gillock.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.762" offset="158386">Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="16.053" offset="167581">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.357" offset="180851">This case presents the question whether Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence encompasses a common law legislative privilege analogous to that under the speech or debate clause of the constitution that prohibits the Federal Government from adducing evidence of the legislative acts of a state legislator in a Federal criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.901" offset="290983">Respondent is a Tennessee State Senator, at least for all relevant times in this litigation he was; elected from Shelby County in the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.221" offset="340302">He was indicted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee on five counts of violations of the Hobbs Act, the Travel Act and the Riekle Act, the racketeering and corrupt practices act.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.684" offset="418147">It was--these three indictment--these several counts of the indictment charged him essentially with two transactions in which he is alleged to have abused his official status.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.491" offset="477288">The first related to an effort for a bribe to prevent the extradition of a Tennessee prisoner to the state of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.785" offset="522533">The second transaction related to, in consideration for a bribe, introducing legislation in the state legislature to enable electricians who were licensed in states with fairly lax requirements to practice their trade in counties that had a more stringent requirement for licensure.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.955" offset="643218">Respondent moved to dismiss the indictment and to suppress evidence of his legislative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.145" offset="679999">The District Court granted the motion to dismiss the Travel Act portion of the indictment, but allowed the other two statutory violations allegations to stand, but did recognize a legislative--an evidentiary privilege which would exclude evidence of legislative acts in the prosecution in the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.338" offset="800684">The government appealed, and the case was remanded to have the District Court specify the legislative act concerning which evidence could not be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.792" offset="850526">The district court again recognized an evidentiary privilege specified the legislative acts concerning which evidence could not be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.865" offset="894830">And the government has--the United States Court of Appeals affirmed the finding that Rule 501 did create an evidentiary privilege relating to legislative acts, and disagreed in part with the identification of certain acts, evidence of which could not be adduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.903" offset="990960">We do not quarrel for the purposes of this appeal with the United States District Court's determination about specific acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.725" offset="1030248">And the only question presented to the Court at this time is whether Rule 501 creates an evidentiary privilege analogous to that under the speech and debate clause benefits only a member of the Federal Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.243" offset="1108302">We assert in our argument three essential points.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.627" offset="1121886">First, that the Federal common law does not recognize a legislative privilege akin to the speech or debate clause in the absence of an underlying immunity from prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.590" offset="1173713">Second, that the separation of powers doctrine that informs the speech or debate clause, does not apply in a case involving a state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.504" offset="1217390">And third, that admission of this evidence is not incompatible with the due regard for the independence and functioning of state governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.703" offset="1258141">On the first point, we begin with the proposition often asserted by this Court that the government is entitled to every man's evidence, and that a privilege that would seek to keep out of a prosecution relevant evidence obstructs the search for truth.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="312.526" offset="1353435">General, how do you reconcile the application of that principle in this case with Tenney v. Brandhove?</text>

          <turn speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="323.685" stopTime="388.219">
            <label>Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="323.685" offset="1398157">Well, Tenney v. Brandhove was a case that recognized a common law immunity from prosecution--I beg your pardon, a common law immunity for civil liability for legislative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.228" offset="1472240">And this was to--on balance, the immunity protected the legislator in the performance of the duty for which he was elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.765" offset="1526471">He was not immunized from criminal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.496" offset="1541308">And this is a case where the respondent was indicted for violation of Federal criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.188" offset="1584149">And we feel that this distinction is sufficient, because there is no interest in protecting the legislator from responding for criminal behavior as there would be for his non-criminal legislative acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.219" offset="1656247">Well, isn't there some interest akin to that spoken of in Mr. Justice White's dissenting opinion in Brewster that if this man is offered a bribe by the electrician--some out of state syndicate to introduce legislative language favoring electricians, that he will thereafter simply shy away from that issue for fear that he will be prosecuted, even though he in good faith believes that such legislation should be introduced?</text>

            <text syncTime="428.110" offset="1815803">Yes, there is validity to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.629" offset="1825938">But the Court has never gone that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.695" offset="1842134">And we submit that the Court should not go that far.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.822" offset="1890617">And the speech or debate clause, as this Court has said, is informed by the values protected under the principle of the separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.760" offset="1934399">And it is to prevent a member of the Congress from being prosecuted either criminally or civilly for anything he does in the way of a legislative act, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="487.482" offset="2053308">But subsequent rulings and decisions by this Court have made it clear that Tenney v. Brandhove is founded in the common law civil immunity of a state legislator, and not the speech and debate clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.234" offset="2124257">Lake Country Estates v. Lake Tahoe is a decision of this Court in which it is recognized that Tenney v. Brandhove is not dependent on the speech or debate clause of the United States Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.029" offset="2419440">The Court has said this on several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.879" offset="2430934">And the privilege, the common law privilege, or the common law immunity from civil liability, it was recognized early in Tenney v. Brandhove, and has been refined in subsequent decisions of this Court, is not an absolute civil immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.756" offset="2502405">It is a civil immunity from damages, but not from injunctive relief, as this Court has indicated Bond v. Atlanta, the case involving Julian Bond who was elected to the Georgia legislature and was denied a seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.997" offset="2591326">And this Court found no obstruction to ordering the legislature to seat him.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.260" offset="2624449">Which means that the civil immunity is just for money damages, and not from injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.322" offset="2652662">Contrariwise, in the case involving Adam Powell, Powell V. McCormack, I think it is, this Court said that the speech or debate clause, on the other hand, immunized the Congress from all liabilities, civil and criminal, and in this context of civil liability, from injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.371" offset="2752867">And the relief ran against subordinate officials of the House, but not against members of the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="748.906" offset="3099042">The separation of powers doctrine, obviously, doesn't apply in the case of a state legislator.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.293" offset="3128508">It operates only at a tier of the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1175.988" offset="4807346">Our position before the District Court, the Court of Appeals, and before this Court, is that a state legislator in a Federal criminal proceeding is entitled to the same evidentiary privilege asserted and upheld in Brewster and Helstoski.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.868" offset="4870875">This Court has never held that a state legislator in a Federal criminal prosecution either does or does not have a Helstoski-type privilege for legislative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.928" offset="4919045">But the government concedes, or this Court has held, that in every other combination in which a legislator can get into court--state court, Federal court--in a civil case or a criminal case, and there are eight combinations of that, and the other seven, in each case, a legislator can look to the speech or debate principle for some relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2021.693" offset="8190098">In fact, the threat of criminal prosecution in the states vitiates the state provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.530" offset="8293543">And perhaps more importantly, the state legislators are powerless to protect themselves against the Federal executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.103" offset="8331786">This is much closer to the scheme which gave rise to the privilege in the first place, when the Crown could prosecute parliament, and parliament could not do anything about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2264.189" offset="9160077">And it depends on Powell v. McCormack for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.859" offset="9174810">In my view of Powell v. McCormack, footnote 26 expressly reserves that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2321.868" offset="9390895">The cases cited in their briefs are prosecutions for Congressmen acting outside the scope of legitimate legislative activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.532" offset="9429452">For example, they may not have any authority to act at all; and they maintain that they act under color of law, and they receive money for using their influence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.144" offset="9611995">Indeed, in the Federal arena, evidence of a president, evidence of a judge, is admissible, the official acts of those gentlemen.</text>

            <text syncTime="2437.552" offset="9853576">More importantly for our case, when O'Shea v. Littleton said, we've never extended official immunity for criminal actions, it's my reading of the case that they're talking about the official immunity that may apply to an aide, as in the Gravel case, the people acting outside the legislative privilege in the--who work for legislators--do have an official immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2778.140" offset="11215914">It recognized that states would retain some degree of sovereignty, but it did not propose to set out the rules under which a state would govern its internal affairs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.958" offset="11359169">When the principle applies, we submit it applies to criminal cases as well as civil cases, and that the privilege is recognized in Federal common law, in Lake Country Estates, Tenney v. Brandhove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.311" offset="11412668">The opinion below recognized an implied limited evidentiary privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.947" offset="11435133">The same privilege applied in Brewster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.483" offset="11449344">This holding is a reasonable accommodation between the interests of the Federal Government and prosecuting state legislators, and the necessity to ensure the independence of those legislators.</text>
