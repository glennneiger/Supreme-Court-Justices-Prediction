            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.246" offset="36885">This case comes to us on certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.245" offset="60918">It presents a problem as to the source of attorney's fees in a rather complicated class action case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.381" offset="89443">As the facts may be unique and of little general interest, I will say only a word about the holding, the District Court awarded the class a lump-sum judgment against Boeing.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.108" offset="144405">The Court then ordered that every member must bear his proportionate part of attorney's fees ultimately to be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.618" offset="182439">Each member of the class has an undisputed and mathematically ascertainable claim to a part of the lump-sum award, whether exercised or not, each class member is legally benefited by this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.503" offset="245969">We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals that each class member must bear as a charge against the fund, his proportionate share of such attorney's fees as ultimately is awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.620" offset="298423">This is an application of the common-fund doctrine and therefore, it is consistent with the American rule against the taxing of attorney's fees against the losing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.005" offset="347951">We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.164" offset="360594">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
