            <text syncTime="195.977" offset="887306">And our contention here is that the double jeopardy clause has -- imposes no restrictions on the sentencing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.592" offset="925759">It establishes no test that must be satisfied in imposing sentence in a single sentencing proceeding following a single trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.462" offset="957210">Now, we have said in our brief that the double jeopardy clause restricts the sentencing court to imposing a sentence that has been authorized by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.696" offset="1006111">And we say that because there is language in this Court's opinions, going back to Ex Parte Lange, that suggest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.568" offset="1029622">But I think that is an essentially trivial proposition which I would not have ascribed to the double jeopardy clause myself, but to the due process clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.456" offset="2969161">We are not talking about punishments being imposed twice on the defendant except in a very hypothetical sense, which is derived from -- well, let us look at Brown v. Ohio for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.643" offset="3025899">Because the Court said in Brown, and I think it was clearly in passing, that the Blockburger test is the test for determining the propriety of multiple punishments under the double jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.921" offset="3079084">Now, I think you would have to agree that Brown did not involve any multiple punishment issue except a derivative of a successive prosecution issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.353" offset="3116805">And elsewhere in the same opinion the Court says that the role of the double jeopardy clause is not to restrict the legislature but to make sure the courts and prosecutors don't exceed their legislative authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.500" offset="3177409">Now, we have a case here where if you accept the statutory construction of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals it is clear that the sentence imposed on this Petitioner did not exceed the legislative authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.102" offset="3227773">And what Petitioner wants to do is to say even though Congress meant to allow this man to receive this sentence for the crimes that he committed, the double jeopardy clause somehow and in some mysterious way by virtue of the Blockburger test and by virtue of the fact that a lesser included offense is the same offense, bars this.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.410" offset="3317008">Now, I cannot see that it is appropriate to take a dictum -- and let me say also that the statement in Brown about the Blockburger test being the test for -- constitutional test for multiple punishments sprung full blown like Palace Athena from nowhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.184" offset="3428080">There is nothing in the prior decisions of this Court that ever suggested that the Blockburger test was a constitutional test for multiple punishments in a context such as we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.380" offset="3480848">Indeed, in Iannalli which was I think two term before Brown, the Court expressly said that the Blockburger test is the test for ascertaining legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.268" offset="3528495">Indeed, it said that about Wharton's rule in a case where the substantive offense necessarily involved conspiracy, the Court said that is a test for ascertaining legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.026" offset="3571440">Now, I certainly submit to the Court that the dictum in Brown is at this point subject to reexamination and ought not to stand in the way of adopting a rule that is consonant with the purposes of the double jeopardy clause and doesn't apply in an area where it doesn't really fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.891" offset="3650957">And what is being done with the Blockburger test if Petitioner has his way, is to pervert the test from its original purpose which was to follow the legislative intent into a test which is being used to thwart the intent of the legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.980" offset="5483290">That is not because the Blockburger test is not satisfied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.156" offset="5500008">Harris v. Oklahoma makes no mention of the Blockburger test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.296" offset="5516518">Harris v. Oklahoma cites only successive prosecution and not multiple punishment cases, and the case it cites is in re Neilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.128" offset="5547865">And in Brown v. Ohio there is a footnote which points out that in re Neilson was a case where the two offenses, cohabitation and adultery, satisfied the Blockburger test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.737" offset="5590288">In order to be guilty of cohabitation you did not have to be married; you simply had to live with two women at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.958" offset="5615156">In order to be guilty of adultery you did not have to live with two women at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.618" offset="5633860">The court nevertheless held that successive prosecutions were barred even though the Blockburger test or each equivalent was satisfied by the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.543" offset="5673566">So all that I am saying is that there is a murky area which I take it includes this area of compound and predicate offenses in which successive prosecutions would be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.473" offset="5721213">But multiple punishments present no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.039" offset="5735528">Let me give you an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.195" offset="5740126">Suppose Congress passed a statute and said that for robbery the punishment would be five years imprisonment; and for armed robbery, the punishment would be the punishment for robbery plus a period of ten years imprisonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1436.690" offset="5850154">Well, that is exactly what the Court of Appeals construed the statutes to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.998" offset="5871365">And if the double jeopardy clause means that Congress has to put it one statute and can't have it in two, I just cannot believe that the double jeopardy clause addresses something as insignificant as how many statutes Congress chooses to put something in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.097" offset="5935731">And let me make another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.730" offset="5946284">To go back to Justice Stewart's reference to Ex Parte Lange and the bar in multiple punishments, multiple punishments for a single crime are an every day occurrence in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.278" offset="5992469">The defendant can be imprisoned, he can be fined, he can suffer a forfeiture, he can be sentenced to a term of special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.620" offset="6029876">Now, a fine followed by a term of special parole for exactly the same offense sounds like two punishments for one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.499" offset="6061328">But if it is imposed following a single trial and a single sentencing proceeding, nobody I think would suggest that there is anything the least bit wrong with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.187" offset="6096123">And I simply cannot bring myself to believe that the double jeopardy clause, to come back to 924(c), means that Congress cannot say if you use a firearm in the commission of a Federal felony you are to receive a consecutive sentence of two years imprisonment, or whatever it may be, beyond the sentence imposed for the underlying felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.601" offset="6189746">That is exactly what Congress has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.506" offset="6201448">And if Petitioner is right, the double jeopardy clause prohibits that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.824" offset="7206640">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.905" offset="7218970">To begin with, it is our view that if Congress did not intend consecutive punishment here, did not authorized such punishment, then when the lower court makes a mistake of that sort it is making a mistake which results in the denial of the defendant's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.560" offset="7277589">And therefore this Court should, and must, review that legislative -- that determination of legislative intent, it is not like other kinds of errors in construing legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.334" offset="7328684">On the constitutional issue itself though, it is our position -- and we submit it is borne out by this Court's decision in the companion case of Pearce v. North Carolina, the case of Rica v. Alabama, in that case the defendant pled guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.261" offset="7392423">Two and a half years into his term he successfully challenged his convictions in a petition for quorum novus relief in the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.919" offset="7427009">He then was tried on the same charges that he had pled to and he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.421" offset="7445086">The judge imposed a sentence and ordered that credit not be given for time served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.196" offset="7472149">He imposed a 25-year sentence and ordered that no credit for the 2-1/2 years be given for time served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.605" offset="7493778">Now, this Court pointed out that the judge could have given a 27-1/2-year sentence with credit for time served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.462" offset="7517184">That would have been within the statutory maximum permitted for the offenses of which he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.796" offset="7538604">Nevertheless, this Court vacated and ordered that credit be given -- it didn't vacate it, but ordered that credit be given for time served because by failing to give credit for time served, the defendant was twice punished for the same offense, even though he could have been punished to the same extent with credit for time served.</text>
