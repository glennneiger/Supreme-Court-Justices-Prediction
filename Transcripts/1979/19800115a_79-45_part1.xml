            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="81.792" offset="430582">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.917" offset="443016">This case is here on appeal from a three-judge District Court in the Northern District of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.293" offset="476557">It is a constitutional case in the Commerce Clause area relating to banks, involves specifically the validity of two Florida statutes dully enacted by the Florida Legislature, designed to prevent activities in Florida by subsidiaries of out-of-state bank holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.931" offset="579062">The first of these statutes is Section 659.141 of the Florida statutes as amended effective in December 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.339" offset="640711">This is set out in full in Appendix A at the close of the appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.240" offset="668296">That's the red brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.294" offset="684596">The appendices are separately paginated but I think it can be easily found at the beginning of Appendix A.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.202" offset="724198">The part which is relevant in this case is at the beginning of the section, on the first half of page A1, except it's provided in Subsection 3 “No bank, trust company, or holding company, the operations of which are principally conducted outside the State, shall acquire, retain, or own directly all or substantially all the assets of, or control over, any bank or trust company having a place of business in the State where the business of banking or trust business or functions are conducted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="195.965" offset="887202">That's the first part.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.020" offset="895457">“Any bank or trust company, or acquire, retain or own all or substantially all of the assets of or control over any business organization having a place of business in the State, where or from which it furnishes investment advisory services in the State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="220.173" offset="984064">Now, that statute was amended in 1972, the reading in its present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.615" offset="1005798">Prior to that, it had been applicable only to the rendering of investment services to banks, but the restriction of the banks was taken out in December 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.162" offset="1063999">It will be seen that this bars an out-of-state bank holding company from one owning any bank or trust company, having a place of business in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.495" offset="1105377">And it also bars an out-of-state bank holding company from owning a subsidiary having a place of business in Florida from which it furnishes investment advisory services.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.643" offset="1161906">The second of the Florida statute is Section 660.10.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.062" offset="1183640">And that is in Appendix B at the close of the appellant's red covered brief and the essential part of it is that, “No one except a bank and trust company incorporated under the laws of the State and having trust powers, except the National Bank located in the State and having trust powers, can exercise any of the following powers which include acting as executive, guardian, trustee, trustee in various situations, receiver assignee, fiscal agent and so on, debarring anybody but Florida corporations from conducting the trust business in Florida.”</text>
            <text syncTime="327.087" offset="1411741">You'll see that fits in with the corresponding provision in the other section.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.742" offset="1654366">And then Section 1 before that says, “The business organization directly or indirectly acting to one or more person's own controls as part about 25% of all the shares of any class of voting security.”</text>
            <text syncTime="400.389" offset="1704939">So those -- now, that language to me connotes a corporation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="459.139" offset="1939937">I -- I agree with you entirely, Mr. Justice, however, the court below did grant an injunction against the enforcement of 659.141 and entered a declaration that Section 660.10 was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.226" offset="2004302">If either of those stand, the result is essentially the same with respect to trust companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.675" offset="2038053">But I think the operative statute is 659.141.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.980" offset="2063339">The court below held that, first to the statutes, was unconstitutional as applied to trust and investment advisory services as an interference with interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.032" offset="2115480">In the Court's words, “This parochial legislation must be deemed per se unconstitutional.”</text>
            <text syncTime="510.135" offset="2143901">It enjoined the enforcement of the statute except as to the ownership of banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.133" offset="2167933">It also gave a declaratory judgment that Section 660.10 is invalid as violative of the Commerce Clause.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="525.483" stopTime="529.572">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="525.483" offset="2205341">The District Court had originally abstained, had it not?</text>
            <text syncTime="528.268" offset="2216417">And then been reversed by the Fifth Circuit?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="529.572" stopTime="816.300">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="529.572" offset="2221641">And they've been -- been reversed by the Fifth Circuit and they went back and they then decided the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.797" offset="2250585">It's our contention that neither of these Florida statutory provisions violates the Commerce Clause as understanding of the effect of that clause has been developed in the teachings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.368" offset="2304815">As this Court recently said in its decision in Hughes against Oklahoma just last April, the case as defining a scope of permissible state regulation in areas of congressional silence, reflect an often controversial evaluation of rules to accommodate federal and state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.285" offset="2384541">And that is what we have involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.839" offset="2406693">The cases show that for the purposes of applying the Commerce Clause as a limitation on state power, the definition of interstate commerce while broad is not without limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.584" offset="2457684">One of the cases which we discussed in our brief is United States against the Oregon State Medical Society which found that local personal services were not interstate commerce for the purpose of the claim involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.098" offset="2547754">Similarly, I would point out that this case does not involve movement of goods across state lines as in Philadelphia against New Jersey, the case upon which the court below primarily relied, or in Hughes against Oklahoma, nor does it involve any restrictions on the means of transportation of goods, such as railroads or trucking companies or airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.668" offset="2650049">In this case, the subject of commerce is the provision of a personal service on a local basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.512" offset="2673455">The next is with interstate commerce, is much less obvious and proof of the substantial effect on interstate commerce is required before a straight -- state restriction can be struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.046" offset="2723506">But there is no such showing of a substantial adverse effect on interstate commerce here.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.868" offset="2746807">No direct evidence of any sort was presented on that matter in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.501" offset="2769377">The case was tried entirely on a stipulation which is set out in full text on pages 22 to 25 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.039" offset="2807515">The court below hypothesized the necessary effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.400" offset="2833011">The court expressly acknowledged that there was no direct evidence of that effect in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.637" offset="2857880">The appellees were the plaintiffs in the court below, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to conclude that they have met their burden of proof on this element.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.321" offset="2908662">We have discussed a number of cases in our brief but the case which is closest to this, I believe, is the decision two years ago in Exxon Corporation against the Governor of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.199" offset="2976162">It's appropriate, I think, to point out that the court below didn't even discuss the Exxon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.975" offset="2995284">It didn't even cite it in its opinion, though it is, I think, clearly the closest case.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.405" offset="3024959">It involved a Maryland statute which prohibited all producers and refiners of petroleum products from operating retail service stations in Maryland or from discriminating between customers in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.974" offset="3083264">Now, there are no producers or refiners of petroleum products in Maryland which everyone knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.481" offset="3109282">It is suggested in the other side of the brief here that this statute is bad because it is discriminatory on its phase whereas the Maryland -- Maryland statute was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.775" offset="3158497">But this Court said in the Hughes against Oklahoma case last spring, that a statute must be determined as to whether it is discriminatory on its face or in its operation and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.382" offset="3216906">And the impact of the statute in the Exxon case was entirely on out-of-state refiners and producers which operated service stations in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.528" offset="3273435">This Court noted that statute did not totally block interstate marketers of petroleum from -- from entering the Maryland market and this statute does not totally block extra state corporations, individuals, businesses, other than banks and bank holding companies from entering the -- the Florida market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.009" offset="5227395">The first to these statutes was the McFadden Act which was passed in 1927, more than 50 years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.010" offset="5479424">By creating a corporation to own multiple banks, it was possible to avoid limitations on branching not only in intrastate but across state lines across many state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.966" offset="5535222">It was to deal with this problem that Congress passed the Bank Holding Company Act in 1956, and it contains three provisions that are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.304" offset="5584541">The first of this is Section 3 (d), and that appears in Appendix C as 12 U.S.C. 1842 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.455" offset="5645145">And it provides -- it -- it bars any bank holding company or subsidiary from acquiring any additional bank located outside of the State where the holding company's banking subsidiaries are operating unless this is expressly authorized by the outside State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.572" offset="5737618">And here, we have the Florida statute which says, “We don't authorize, just what's invited by that provision.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.644" offset="5765935">And the second provision is Section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act, now found in 12 U.S.C. 1843.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.768" offset="5798431">It's in Appendix D at the close of the appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.955" offset="5823195">The basic provision there says, “Except as otherwise provided in this Act, no bank holding company shall acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company which is not a bank.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.668" offset="5898010">And if it has said that this investment advisory and trust company services are not banks, Congress has said, “The out-of-state holding company can't own it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.820" offset="5942627">And then finally, there at Section 7 of the Bank Holding Company Act, which is in Appendix E, which broadly reserved to the States their powers to regulate bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, the last three words are “and subsidiaries thereof” as long as the state regulation is not inconsistent with the acts of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.995" offset="6067388">Now, thus, the basic federal statutory scheme maybe stated very simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.597" offset="6089749">“No bank holding company may own a bank outside the home state without the outside State's expressed permission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.097" offset="6123708">It does not seem to me to be too difficult to construe this to apply to bits and pieces of banks, particularly when they are owned by a bank holding company and are so closely related to managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereof as the federal board -- Reserve Board has determined.</text>
