            <text syncTime="12.944" offset="51722">This case is here on appeal from a three-judge District Court with the District of Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.603" offset="78367">The question is whether a state prisoner is entitled to a hearing when he is declared to be suffering from a mental disease or defect and transferred to a mental hospital for a treatment that is not available in the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.505" offset="137927">The three-judge court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a hearing and specified the procedures to be included in -- in the hearing including a holding that counsel was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.380" offset="209502">Because of the question of mootness, we postponed the -- the question of jurisdiction to the merits and heard oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.000" offset="239909">As indicated in an opinion on file with the clerk, a majority of five justices holds that the case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.185" offset="272718">We then agree with the district court that under the Due Process Clause, a prisoner about to be transferred to a mental hospital is entitled to notice and a hearing, to be present, offer testimony and cross-examined, and they'll have an independent maker and a written statement of the evidence and the reasons for the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.804" offset="351190">Four of us, Justices Brennan, Marshall, Stevens, and I, also agree with the District Court that the prisoner is entitled with the help of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.099" offset="384313">Mr. Justice Powell, however, has indicated in his separate opinion concurring in part would require a competent help for the prisoner but not necessarily a licensed attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.022" offset="427990">The judgment of the District Court is accordingly modified in this respect and is modified that it is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.789" offset="455053">Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Blackmun have filed dissenting opinions on the jurisdictional aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.322" offset="481280">The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have joined Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
