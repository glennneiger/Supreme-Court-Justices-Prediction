            <label>Mr. Richard G. Vinet</label>
            <text syncTime="55.448" offset="325151">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.119" offset="335809">This is an anti-trust suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.873" offset="342915">It was brought seeking triple damages and an injunction against the real estate brokers in New Orleans, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.670" offset="366007">The plaintiffs are buyers and sellers of one- to four-family homes in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.995" offset="383352">They bring this suit on their own behalf, and also as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.561" offset="397667">The defendants are two local professional associations of realtors, six real estate firms who variously dealt with the plaintiffs in their own transactions; and finally, a defendant class consisting of all the real estate agents and brokers who operated in the New Orleans area during the limitation period of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.087" offset="471751">Your Honors, the suit charges price fixing in commissions for the sale of real estate brokerage services.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.163" offset="492022">The effects on the plaintiffs are alleged to be that the prices of homes are artificially raised to buyers and/or that the proceeds received by sellers, when they sell their homes, are artificially reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.532" offset="541550">The factors of interstate commerce involved in the transactions are the financing aspects of the sales; the title insurance aspects of the sale; and also, governmental loan guarantees through the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.760" offset="598392">Defendants, after the suit was filed, moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, or that alternatively, any claim that it might have stated didn't arise under either Federal question jurisdiction or under diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.625" offset="653876">The realtors state that their activities are not in interstate commerce, and their activities don't substantially affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.071" offset="683656">The suit was filed in October of '75, and in the fall of '76, the trial court ordered discovery to be had on the jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.006" offset="715421">Specifically, the discovery was designed to show whether or not there was a substantial involvement of interstate commerce in the real estate transactions; and secondly, whether brokerage--or real estate brokerage--was a necessary and integral part of the transaction which was, in the words of the trial court, inseparable from its interstate aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.482" offset="801311">Pursuant to the discovery order, depositions were taken and submitted to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.276" offset="824508">Thereafter, the case was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.526" offset="833494">The trial judge failed to find a sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to justify the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.018" offset="863483">The judgment was later affirmed in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and this past May, this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.119" offset="891800">May it please the Court, Your Honors, the allegation of the complaint, and the evidence that we developed from discovery, support the exercise of anti-trust jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.945" offset="931192">Because these transactions involve land does not limit the application of traditional jurisdictional analysis to the facts that we alleged and the facts that we adduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.892" offset="970898">Realtors don't sell land, Your Honors; they sell service, or more properly, an array of services which are indispensable to the buyer or seller of homes in today's real estate markets.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.857" offset="1010813">Mr. Vinet, let me make sure I understand your contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.002" offset="1027427">It isn't that you should have had more of an opportunity to present evidence on the interstate commerce or affecting interstate commerce aspects in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.267" offset="1068492">It's that as a matter of law the district court should have ruled in your favor?</text>

            <text syncTime="248.793" offset="1098585">I think we've raised the point in the Fifth Circuit that we had no discovery on the issue, or the merits, the price-fixing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.391" offset="1128887">And we've contended that the--that the ultimate fact of the lawsuit--the price-fixing is also a jurisdictional fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.610" offset="1157831">That wasn't the point I was making just now, however, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.230" offset="1216240">Is it that you didn't have enough chance to develop your case on that, or that the trial court, affirmed by the Fifth Circuit, simply was wrong on the evidence before it?</text>

            <text syncTime="292.748" offset="1274337">But essentially, I think the trial court interpreted this Court's decision in Goldfarb to require something alone the lines of an in-commerce showing in order to justify jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.705" offset="1318222">That's why he talked about necessary and integral, and inseparable from the interstate aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.275" offset="1336508">I think he was looking for some sort of a procedural relationship, much like--you've got to have a title--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <text syncTime="319.124" offset="1379871">Yes, Your Honor, but not because it found facts that didn't exist, but because it applied a standard that wasn't broad enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.971" offset="1459284">Your Honor, Goldfarb is distinct from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.978" offset="1475271">Goldfarb--well, yes, in the sense that Your Honor cited the opinion by saying that, were they engaged in interstate commerce, or did their activities substantially affect interstate commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="353.585" offset="1517693">Well, I believe that Your Honor found, in fact, that they were more engaged in interstate commerce than they were affecting interstate commerce, in the sense of the Mandeville Island kind of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.546" offset="1565550">It's more like Yellow Cab, where the ride between the train stations was part of the journey.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.196" offset="1584149">That's what the title lawyers were like.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.817" offset="1590627">Now, we're saying the realtors aren't like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.510" offset="1597419">They're a little bit different.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.099" offset="1607764">Their effect on interstate commerce is more of an economic thing; it's more of a structural way that the real estate market functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.658" offset="1637961">In fact, I was just going to talk about that, about how the real estate market actually works.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.635" offset="1653948">But that's basically a factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.305" offset="1664606">You have a factual finding by the district court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, against you on that point, don't you?</text>

            <text syncTime="399.177" offset="1700028">We have a factual finding to the effect that real estate brokers don't stand in quite the same relationship to the transaction as title lawyers do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.418" offset="1741093">And in that sense, we lost the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.497" offset="1749347">Because I believe that we--the district court and the Court of Appeals expected us to show that.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.124" offset="3883865">That became important when the Fifth Circuit recharacterized the dismissal as a factual tack on jurisdiction whereby the allegations of the petition were no longer accorded the presumption of truthfulness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.580" offset="5045687">That's how the Court found jurisdiction in Goldfarb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.285" offset="5056554">And our opinion, or our position, is that the district court and the Court of Appeals perhaps feeling that land is completely unique and it doesn't cross state lines, or it doesn't move in commerce, feeling all that to be the case, that the district court just took that same language, and they said, well, that's the way the Supreme Court found jurisdiction in Goldfarb, and that's the only way it can be the quintessential local product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.504" offset="5161357">And they use the language, substantial effect, Your Honor, but if you read the opinion, you're going to see that what they wanted us to show was that real estate brokers are like title lawyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.822" offset="5362709">The Court of Appeals thought that petitioners in this case were trying to argue that real estate, which it termed the quintessentially local product, is part of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.036" offset="5407535">It said that the answer was no, because there had been no showing that the activities of brokers were essential to loans in exactly the way the activities of lawyers were essential to loans in the Goldfarb case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbook</label>
            <text syncTime="1368.209" offset="5576182">The Court of Appeals opinion is internally inconsistent in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.211" offset="5592168">There are other portions of the opinion that appear to say that they're asking the question whether real estate itself, rather than the brokerage services, is part of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.061" offset="5631666">I take it that real estate is not part of interstate commerce, unless you have a river meandering, and you have an original jurisdiction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.033" offset="5655489">But this is quite a different matter entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.360" offset="5664789">The argument -- the argument, I think, is a rather straightforward argument, one of practical economics, as the Court put it in the Rex Hospital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.240" offset="5696345">And it runs almost identical to the argument that this Court accepted in Burke v. Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.812" offset="5714631">It runs something like this Brokers sell information and assistance in conducting transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.217" offset="5744201">Their services aren't tied to the land, but rather, are tied to the clients and to the clients' money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.529" offset="5765517">A price-fixing agreement, setting the price of those services, increases their price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.384" offset="5784952">When the price of a commodity is increased, less of that commodity is purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.746" offset="5806373">If less brokerage service is purchased, it is less likely that buyers and sellers will get together on a real estate deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.514" offset="5833435">And that's particularly important for interstate movers, who often rely on brokers as their sole source of information about the market of the state into which they're moving.</text>

            <text syncTime="1441.906" offset="5870947">Is it your understanding of Rex that it held, as a matter of law, that there was jurisdiction, or simply it said that the trial court should have decided it as a factual question?</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbook</label>
            <text syncTime="1453.630" offset="5917863">It said that it had to be decided as a factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.763" offset="5930402">It did say, however, that the standards, the legal standards used by the lower court for disposing of that factual question were erroneous; the same kind of argument we make here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.651" offset="5973974">That -- the final touch of that is that a reduction in the number of real estate transactions which is caused by this increase in the price of information and service will affect the interstate money market at the same time as it affects the interstate movement of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.486" offset="6045341">That's a rather straightforward argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.363" offset="6052864">The effect on commerce can be traced clearly and unambiguously in the same way it was traced in Burke v. Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.790" offset="6078568">And therefore, we think the Court of Appeals was wrong in saying that plaintiffs should not even be allowed to prove at trial that interstate commerce was affected by this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.160" offset="6120051">In fact, if the Court of Appeals argument is that plaintiff isn't even to be allowed to prove it at trial, the contention is that the activities of brokers are completely outside the powers of Congress under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.459" offset="6169161">The Sherman Act, it's been held, expresses all of the power that Congress has to exercise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.750" offset="8706382">The problem in showing interstate commerce in Goldfarb, on the assumption that the lawyers' price had not been increased by this fee schedule, was how to show any effect on commerce at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2222.946" offset="8995192">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.000" offset="9011388">I would like initially to respond to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question, because I think this is one of the more important questions before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.707" offset="9050154">And that question was, whether we contend that there was a factual issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.017" offset="9075440">And the short answer to that question is, we not only do not concede that there is no factual issue, but we contend that there was a factual issue, and that the factual issue was adversely resolved against these petitioners, and that absent some showing of clear error, that that factual resolution should stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.217" offset="9164257">Second, as to the contention that these petitioners were deprived of the opportunity to show the effect on commerce, and that they were restricted by reason of the district court's order limiting them to the Goldfarb case, the fact of the matter is that these petitioners embraced Goldfarb closely and joyously from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.549" offset="9293615">The term that they used in some of their memoranda was that "Goldfarb loves the instant case."</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.639" offset="9325902">Now it followed from that when the district judge called his pre-trial conference in September and suggested that there be discovery, he was following precisely the lead that petitioners had suggested that he follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.668" offset="9402075">He said, You have talked about Goldfarb; I'm going to give you an opportunity to show that Goldfarb did, in fact, as you say, love this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.627" offset="9449932">The question was asked whether there was any objection on petitioner's part to that alleged limit to petitioner's discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.167" offset="9488071">And the answer is, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.823" offset="9494653">This record will be examined with care, and there will be no indication of any objection whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.706" offset="9530180">The plain fact of the matter is that this concept of affecting interstate commerce through the alleged affect on the sale of houses by reason of the supposed fixed commission is an afterthought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.826" offset="9598725">And what this Court is being asked to do is, to supply what these petitioners didn't supply in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.047" offset="9635610">This Court is not being asked to review whether, on the facts before it, the district court reached the correct decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.118" offset="9671868">It's not being asked whether, on the record before it, the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the holding of the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.337" offset="9708753">What this Court is being asked to do is to go behind the record, and to assume that had these petitioners put on a different case, that the result would have been different.</text>

            <text syncTime="2481.925" offset="10031104">But as I read the phrase, "this particular real estate activity," it relates to the particular activity with respect to which there was evidence before the Court; and that what the Court of Appeals did was, that it restricted its holding to the facts which it had before it; and that it did not make a sweeping holding that under no circumstances could there be a situation in which real estate brokers might not have some affect--effect--on interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2546.819" offset="10290657">I think we have a better situation than that, because this -- it must be borne in mind -- decision was not on the face of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.569" offset="10333602">But this decision was rendered after these petitioners had the opportunity to adduce evidence in support of their allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.406" offset="10369024">And I think it is important for this Court to realize, to recall, that it was in September, I believe early in September, that the district judge entered his order saying that discovery should take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.594" offset="10429733">And as I have pointed out, there was no objection to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.961" offset="10447182">The record is completely silent on any objection by these petitioners at that time, or at any other time, to the supposed limits on discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.165" offset="10496084">Now, what the judge did was, he said, I'm going to order discovery -- all this appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.157" offset="10523982">And a month later he called another pre-trial conference, and he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.438" offset="10549164">"I will give you until December 31st"--it was then early in October--"in which to complete your discovery."</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.551" offset="10577586">No objection at that time, no suggestion that the breadth of the discovery should be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.158" offset="10607992">It was not until the middle of December that the first notice of taking a deposition was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.598" offset="10637772">On or about December 21st, I think it was, these petitioners moved to extend the time in which their discovery could be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.084" offset="10679672">And it will be noted that that motion does not recite that they were improperly restricted as to what their scope of discovery should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.727" offset="10726275">The basis for that motion was, that they didn't have time to set up the depositions, that they were having difficulty in getting the deponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.157" offset="10763995">So I would say that I think that we should lay at rest my suggestion that the district court improperly, in any way, limited the discovery by these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.407" offset="10821047">Because had they really thought that there was such limit, clearly it was incumbent upon them to say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.507" offset="10853439">You don't come to a Court of Appeals and say, the court has improperly instructed the jury, without taking exception to the jury charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.321" offset="10892622">And for these petitioners now to say, "Well, we tried our cases on one theory below, and we adduced evidence on that, but had we thought about it as we now think about it, we would have put in different evidence."</text>

            <text syncTime="3663.339" offset="14756760">Or the interstate sale of houses affected?</text>

            <text syncTime="3670.012" offset="14783404">And if I may continue on the line suggested by Mr. Justice Stewart, I think we should bear in mind that the activities of real estate brokers as such are clearly intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.484" offset="14841292">Now, the suggestion is that you bridge the gap between that intrastate commerce and the, I would say, undisputed interstate commerce in lending and title insurance, is that you accept as a given, without any proof, that the price of houses will, if increased by maintenance of the percentage on real estate brokers' commissions, and that that in turn will affect the number of transactions and the amount of sales and the amount -- therefore, the amount bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.699" offset="14998131">We say first, that that is not by any means proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.773" offset="15014431">But second -- and I think it is important for me to make this point -- we would respectfully submit that what we're talking about is an incidental effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.857" offset="15054764">It is not such an effect as to contemplated by the line of decisions which has been mentioned here, and I wish to treat that particularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.428" offset="15101053">These petitioners rely heavily on Mandeville Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.567" offset="15117667">Now, Mandeville Island was a very special case, because the whole process of growing sugar and refining sugar was so closely integrated that this Court concluded that they were inseparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.449" offset="15185168">But Mandeville Island was not the genesis of this affectation doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.792" offset="15210559">We have to go back to the Shreveport rate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.572" offset="15225710">We have to go back to first and second Coronado, we have to go back to Apex Hosiery against Lieder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.368" offset="15252877">And as I appreciate what was held in those cases, Shreveport rate held that it was permissible for the anti-trust -- for the Interstate Commerce Commission to act with respect to purely intrastate rates because they directly affected interstate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.790" offset="15338559">In first Coronado, and in second Coronado, what this Court held, as I appreciate it, is that the activity of the union in not only calling a strike but in the violence and all of that in first Coronado was held not to be in interstate commerce because it was not intended to affect interstate commerce, nor was it inevitably -- nor would it inevitably do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3848.102" offset="15495816">But in second Coronado, they want back and they took evidence, and the critical finding there was that the purpose of the strike was to diminish the amount of coal which was available in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.810" offset="15558614">And the Court said, with that, we now find that you have a direct affect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.346" offset="15584737">You have a substantial affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.481" offset="15593305">Now, when Apex Hosiery came along, you had another strike (this was not a criminal case).</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.200" offset="15616188">This was where the strikers pulled a sit-down strike, and they prevented the movement in interstate commerce of substantial amounts of hosiery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.317" offset="15656626">And what this Court held was, that that was not a case which affected interstate commerce in the sense required for application of the Sherman Act.</text>
