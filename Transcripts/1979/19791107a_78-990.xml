            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">The hearing next is the United States v. Clifford Bailey.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.705" offset="366216">Mr. Kneedler, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="70.085" offset="383666">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.045" offset="395577">These cases are before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.537" offset="421491">The cases arise under the Federal statute 18 United States Code Section 751 that prohibits a person from escaping from the custody of the Attorney General or from any custody in which he was placed under Federal law pursuant to court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.582" offset="485752">There are two issues presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.837" offset="494738">First is whether in establishing the intent element of the crime of escape, the Government is required to prove merely that the defendant left the prison consciously, not inadvertently.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.364" offset="548864">In addition, the Government prove that the defendant intended to avoid only those aspects of confinement in the prison that may be regarded as normal.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.072" offset="591705">Under the latter formulation which was adopted by the Court of Appeals in this case, a prisoner who deliberately left a prison but did so for the purpose of avoiding certain harsh conditions there would not commit the crime of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.599" offset="661817">The second issue concerns the nature of the showing a defendant in an escape case must make under Section 751 in order to raise the defense duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.420" offset="705076">This defense has long been recognized that the common law and generally in Federally criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.006" offset="735378">The Court must decide here whether a defendant who raises the duress offense in an escape prosecution must show that he was threatened with imminent serious harm at the time of his departure from the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.445" offset="797132">And whether he can raise the defense if he remained in hiding after he departed from prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.800" offset="834539">Respondents Bailey, Walker and Cooley were convicted following a jury trial and escaped from the District of Columbia jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.628" offset="865886">Each was sentenced to five years imprisonment to serve consecutively to sentences previously imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.035" offset="899532">Respondent Cooley was convicted in a later jury trial of escaping from the District of Columbia jail as well and he too was sentenced to imprisonment for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.297" offset="940596">Prior to the escape Respondent Bailey had been serving a sentence in the Leavenworth penitentiary on conviction of bank robbery and attempted escape but he was brought to the District of Columbia to testify in a pending criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.037" offset="995558">Respondent Walker was also serving a sentence in the Leavenworth penitentiary on conviction of bank robbery and he too was brought to the District of Columbia to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.927" offset="1035055">Respondent Cooley was serving his sentence in the District of Columbia jail based on a conviction for unlawful possession of firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.866" offset="1066820">The evidence at the trial of these three Respondents showed that they left the jail in the early morning hours of August 26, 1976 by crawling through a window in the Northeast 1 Unit of the District of Columbia jail, which was the maximum security facility at the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.748" offset="1138395">They were apprehended by FBI agents in the District of Columbia on November 19, December 13 and September 27, respectively, which was from one to three months after their departure from the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.305" offset="1204642">Respondents did not dispute at trial that they left the jail without permission and that they had remained in hiding until they were apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.504" offset="1237347">But they sought to justify their escape by introducing evidence of what they contended were intolerable conditions in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.574" offset="1269635">Early in the trial and on several occasions thereafter the Government argued that they were not entitled to raise the defense of duress because they had not surrendered to custody promptly after their departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.258" offset="1316446">The Court agreed with the Government on this point and several times informed Respondents to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.611" offset="1337866">They chose to allow them to present their evidence of jail conditions and to wait until the end of the trial to determine whether evidence was in the record to support a finding that they had satisfied the return requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.432" offset="1389066">The three Respondents and several other inmates and several jail officials then testified about certain conditions in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.610" offset="1421772">There was testimony that trash, sheets, mattresses and similar items were burned, some of the testimony suggested frequently, during the summer of 1976 prior to the escape.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="343.069" offset="1475688">Burned by guards as well as by inmates?</text>

            <text syncTime="347.808" offset="1494601">There was testimony from several inmates that there had been certain things burned by guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.825" offset="1526680">There was a description of a guard who -- burning some trash.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="359.695" offset="1542144">I take it the Government concedes that some of these conditions were "intolerable"?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="369.316" stopTime="370.714">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="369.316" offset="1580596">No, we don't.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="370.714" stopTime="373.277">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="370.714" offset="1586239">What do you concede?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="373.277" stopTime="409.029">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="373.277" offset="1596479">Well, for purposes of the case in this this Court, the Respondents' evidence has to be read in the light most favorably to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.122" offset="1639842">So to that extent for purposes of this case we are considering the facts as presented to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.674" offset="1674115">But we do not concede for example that the conditions of the fires even as described presented the type of threat of imminent serious bodily injury or harm that the duress defense has usually been reserved for.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="409.029" stopTime="412.496">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="409.029" offset="1739525">Well, the jury convicted these defendants, didn't they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="412.496" stopTime="435.683">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="412.496" offset="1753318">That is right, but the -- but after the judge had instructed them at the close of the trial, the judge concluded that there was not evidence in the record from which the jury could find that they had satisfied the return requirement of duress defense they had not surrendered to custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.022" offset="1819460">And therefore he did not give them duress instruction and directed the jury not to consider the jail conditions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="435.683" stopTime="449.175">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="435.683" offset="1846105">Well, then how can we be sure just what the jail conditions were, since presumably the jury was entitled to disbelieve the testimony of witnesses heard?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="449.175" stopTime="1141.356">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="449.175" offset="1900022">Well, surely, yes, that is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.547" offset="1913605">I think on the basis of the record as it comes to the Court that there is not a jury verdict that took into account the jail conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.113" offset="1959790">So again, the evidence has to be considered in the manner presented by the Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.162" offset="1996048">In addition to the evidence of the fires, Respondents Cooley and Bailey also presented some testimony that they were beaten by guards during the summer and that they were threatened with similar action.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.239" offset="2044322">Respondent Walker did not base his duress on such beating but did allege that he had, and sought to establish that he had received inadequate medical treatment for an alleged epileptic condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.494" offset="2105344">Finally, Respondent Cooley also at one time testified that he left on the morning of the 26th because he had been threatened by Bailey and Walker, but he later admitted that there was no one outside the cell when he left, that the threats occurred later and he didn't know whether Bailey and Walker had actually left.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.311" offset="2200639">The Respondents also sought to testify about certain actions that happened after they escaped.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.026" offset="2219447">Respondent Walker testified that he made three telephone calls to the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.597" offset="2241808">The agent with whom he spoke, Walker testified, assured him that he would not be harmed if he surrendered but refused to guarantee that he would not be returned in to the District of Columbia jail if he did surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.318" offset="2292694">Respondent Bailey testified that he had someone else call the authorities but he didn't identify who that was and he admitted that he didn't make any telephone calls himself or make any other effort to turn himself in.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.569" offset="2341700">Respondent Cooley's testimony on this point is somewhat ambiguous but it can be read to suggest that certain members of his family may have tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.087" offset="2387675">And the Government did present witnesses in an effort to rebut this testimony and had the duress defense been presented to the jury, then this Government evidence would have come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.910" offset="2443055">As I mentioned, at the close of trial the Court denied Respondents' request for jury instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.156" offset="2463953">It also instructed the jury that escape is a general intent crime and in explaining that the Court stated that general intent only requires to do an act consciously or purposely rather than inadvertently.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.059" offset="2523617">And by this, I think it is fair to say the Court was referring to the act of leaving the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.633" offset="2545873">The evidence at Respondent Cogdell's trial showed that he also left the District of Columbia jail on the 26th and he was apprehended hiding in a closet in a residence in Hyattsville, Maryland about a month later.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.882" offset="2598849">Respondent Cogdell also offered that his departure was compelled by prison conditions, but because he too had not surrendered the Court rejected his proffered testimony and the duress defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.116" offset="2655796">The jury returned a verdict of guilty in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.251" offset="2668335">The Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed the convictions and remanded some new trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.914" offset="2699055">The Court of Appeals found two bases on which the jury could have or should have been able to consider the evidence of the jail conditions prior to the departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.506" offset="2737403">First, the Court of Appeals thought that this evidence bore on the question of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.656" offset="2761958">In the Court of Appeals view, once a defendant in an escape case has introduced evidence of what the Court would term abnormal conditions of confinement, there is at least a question raised as to whether the defendant actually intended to leave confinement as such or whether he was really motivated by a desire to avoid those unpleasant conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.077" offset="2851715">Accordingly, the Court held that it made him guilty of escape only if he had the intent to avoid abnormal conditions of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.313" offset="2892675">The Court also concluded that Respondents' evidence of jail conditions was sufficient to raise a jury question under the duress defense, but in doing so the Court stated that the traditional rule of duress defense, that it can be raised only where the defendant acted out of immediate threat of serious harm should be relaxed in the prison escape context because the opportunity for a prisoner to escape may not remain available, while a substantial threat would right that into an immediate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.771" offset="3018480">Finally, the District Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court had erred in imposing a firm return requirement for defendant after he departed from custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.985" offset="3055261">The Court advocated that the failure of a prisoner to return to custody was essentially a fact for the jury to consider in determining whether his continued absence might be justified by a possible continuation of the conditions that led him to depart.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.008" offset="3127359">Government's suggestion for rehearing en banc was denied and the Government then petitioned for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.945" offset="3151182">The Court of Appeals decision if affirmed by this Court could have serious ramifications for the courts in interpreting the law of escape and as a result could also have serious consequences for the order and security of the District of Columbia jail, the Federal penal system generally and society at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.098" offset="3231744">Escape carries with it a substantial potential for violence, even where the inmate himself does not intend to resort to violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.433" offset="3265076">Escapes also disrupt the order of the prison and cause understandable apprehension among the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.145" offset="3287960">For these reasons and because escape demonstrates contempt for the rule of law, escape has been traditionally treated as a serious crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.547" offset="3325576">Any effort to justify or excuse an escape must therefore be treated with considerable caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.095" offset="3355773">The Court of Appeals holding that a prisoner does not commit an offense if he escapes to avoid certain adverse conditions of confinement rather than confinement as such, finds no support in case law, Federal or State.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.060" offset="3411571">Moreover, the Court's distinction between what is called normal and non-normal conditions of confinement is not fully articulated in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.159" offset="3455979">And the basis of that distinction is not wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.932" offset="3467055">For example, it isn't clear whether all jail situations that this Court might find to be in violation of the Eighth Amendment would be considered to be non-normal, at least as traditionally determined, and therefore justify a prisoner in escaping.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.980" offset="3535287">There is also no expressed requirement as the intent argument is formulated by the Court of Appeals that these adverse conditions present an immediate threat to the safety or health or life of the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.602" offset="3597772">Therefore, the manner in which the Court of Appeals dealt with the intent element introduces a great deal of uncertainty and vagueness into the crime of escape and causes prisoners, would cause corruptions officials and juries and judges to speculate and guess as to what types of conditions might excuse an escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.981" offset="3699336">Finally, the Court of Appeals treatment of the intent element has the effect of converting an escape into a self-help remedy by which the prisoner may seek to avoid the conditions of confinement that are unsatisfactory to him rather than resorting to legal remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.460" offset="3761194">In this case the Respondents indisputably intended to leave the District of Columbia jail, whatever may have been their motivation in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.491" offset="3793377">And there is no indication that Congress intended the Government should have to prove anything more than that in making out a prima facie case of escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.272" offset="3828485">The Court of Appeals evident concern about the dilemma of a prisoner who faces truly threatening conditions in a jail is therefore better dealt with not in the intent element which is part of the Government's case in chief, but where it has traditionally been addressed and that is in the affirmative defense of duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.435" offset="3901106">That defense has over the years embodied the societal and legal judgment there are occasions when it is inappropriate to punish a person because his conduct was compelled by external forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.082" offset="3959724">The duress defense has long recognized that at least in some circumstances a person cannot fairly be blamed for his conduct in those situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.761" offset="3994415">The conduct of one who acts under compulsion is still criminal because all of the elements of the crime are present, including the intent to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.280" offset="4032449">But even though criminal, the conduct is excused for reasons of social policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.133" offset="4059930">It is apparent however that the defense of duress carries with it the seeds of potential disorder because it allows a judge and jury to excuse conduct in a particular case that the representatives of the people have chosen to make criminal and because it may also create an incentive for a defendant to claim falsely that he acted under coercion when it will be quite difficult for the prosecution to disprove those suggestions of coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.425" offset="4193050">As a result, the duress defense has historically been hedged with restrictions which stick to limit its applications to situations in which the individual had no reasonable choice but to commit the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.662" offset="4246026">Thus the defendant is excused only if he acted under a threat of what he reasonably believed to be serious personal injury or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.060" offset="4287613">And that is aggravated circumstances in order society requires an individual would stand a threat rather than break the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.368" offset="4320841">Further, the threatened harm must be unavoidable because if there are other legal recourses available there is no reason to permit the individual to resort to illegal methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.244" offset="4360338">And finally, in order to be excused the criminal conduct may not be of any greater magnitude or duration than is reasonably necessary to avoid the threatened harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="1082.332" offset="4432750">But, the courts have been understandably reluctant to excuse a prisoner when he claims that his departure was compelled by circumstances of confinement, because after all confinement itself is objectionable to many people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.663" offset="4493981">Accordingly, most courts that have considered the issue have required the defendant to satisfy certain prerequisites to raising a duress defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.223" offset="4620309">And finally, the courts have insisted that the prisoner return to custody promptly or report to authorities in meaningful fashion after the departure in order to take advantage of the defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.652" offset="5325928">Some courts have found it useful in discussing the return requirement to characterize escape as a continuing offense in the sense that it is not necessarily consummated at the time the person first gains his freedom but it continues for as long as he remains at large.</text>

            <text syncTime="1347.869" offset="5494888">The continuing offense description that I have just given brings the return requirement into consistency in the duress defense generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.685" offset="5546088">As I mentioned before, one of the traditional elements of the duress defense is that the individual can have engaged in the conduct for no longer than the threat remains outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.286" offset="5596557">Well, in the situation in which a person escapes from prison unlawfully, his departure is unlawful and his absence from custody is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.355" offset="5632815">So as long as he remains there is no excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.996" offset="5643368">So as long as he remains at large he is continuing to engage in an unlawful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.122" offset="5663848">But once he is out of prison he is no longer directly confronted in the back-to-the-wall-type situation by the threats that led him to depart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.734" offset="5698330">And so because the imminent harm is no longer present and because he even more readily has legal means available, then he is no longer permitted -- at that point the duress defense stops excusing his continued absence from prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.169" offset="5772100">Now, another way in which the return requirement may be explained is by giving it as a condition subsequent that the defendant must satisfy in order to raise the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.994" offset="5839391">Under this approach, as I have mentioned the original departure continues to be a crime but it is one that can be excused, the return requirement is a condition which the law attaches to the excuse in order for the defendant to take advantage of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.262" offset="5912430">It is also important to remember that the duress defense in criminal prosecution is traditionally a fashion defense and it is reasonable for the court to fashion it in the escape context by resort to some common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.102" offset="5967809">And in this particular situation I believe common sense would suggest that Congress could not have intended that a person who may have initially fled confinement because of an imminent fear of serious injury could thereafter remain free with impunity and not have to take some measures to put himself back into custody safely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.175" offset="6112110">Take a hypothetical case where a man in fact is subject to duress, in fear of life at the time he leaves and ten days later he has calmed down, he is in the hospital or something and he has had a chance to think it over and he decides, well, I would like to stay out and I am no longer under duress but I am not going to go back.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.252" offset="8256345">But as long as there is some evidence such as was introduced in this case by the defendants that they didn't want to go back because they thought the FBI was going to kill them if they found them, and that they would be returned to the Northeast 1 tier of the prison, that that must be taken into consideration by the jury, it raises a factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.748" offset="8330324">And, except in the most minimal cases where there is essentially no evidence at all, then those questions create issues of fact for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.495" offset="8385390">A good example of why a flexible rule is needed is set forth by the case of Tidman v. Commonwealth in a Kentucky Court of Appeals case cited by 12 Southwestern Second 488 in which a prisoner had one month left to serve on his sentence and left because he had owed a debt to another inmate which he couldn't pay and wasn't threatened with homosexual assaults and couldn't find a guard and he left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.902" offset="8498970">And two days later he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.958" offset="8507225">At the trial the judge refused to let in the evidence that he had only one month to go on his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.784" offset="8526555">And the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which I believe is the highest court in the State, reversed and said that that was very relevant evidence for the jury to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.481" offset="8561246">So in a case like that, if a man is arrested before he has a chance to turn himself in or before he has a chance to collect his thoughts and contact the proper authorities, then he is completely barred from raising the duress defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.189" offset="8620178">And we say that is an unreasonable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.557" offset="8641599">The problem here is how do you deal with someone who has escaped from prison, an unauthorized leaving of the prison.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.395" offset="8704920">In most cases it perhaps could be said the jury will not accept his testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="2361.039" offset="9547525">It has not been briefed by the parties, it was never raised below, and it would simply be inappropriate for the Court to consider that issue on the present record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.925" offset="9587022">But the trend is certainly to recognize the duress defense in the State context and the only issue here is whether the defendant has to turn himself in immediately in order to be able to avail himself of that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.588" offset="9633729">I also want to point out that even though the duress defense was not available in the escape concept, the same evidence came in under a different theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.706" offset="9666226">And you have cases like Woodring and Jackson which the Government relied on for the proposition that 751 creates a continuing offense where the same evidence was received on the issue of an offense of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.958" offset="9731218">And in both those cases, as I recall it the Court held, or the jury was instructed that the intent required was an intent to avoid confinement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2421.174" offset="9788061">Woodring has been out for two years I believe after leaving McNeil Island as a result of a threat and the Court held that the jury had ample basis on which to reject his evidence that he did not have sufficient intent and in Chapman I believe the defendant was out for two years and there was a similar result.</text>

            <text syncTime="2498.859" offset="10098813">With respect to the voluntariness issue, as I indicated before I think this raises substantial problems with respect to Sandstrom.</text>

            <text syncTime="2540.291" offset="10264534">And Respondent was to show how the majority was in error, unsuccessfully I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.175" offset="10288044">But what was common among the majority in the dissent, and which I don't think there is any dispute about between the parties in this case, an essential element of the offense of escape is voluntariness and what that means is free will, or as Judge Wilkey said, the beast compulsive at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.039" offset="10363486">And if the defendant has evidence that shows that he did not have free will when he left the jail -- in other words, that he was coerced, then that evidence must go to the jury, the factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.466" offset="10409253">And the effect of what the judge did in this case was to take it away from the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3245.495" offset="13085341">The situation where he is attacked by a homosexual, the situations that exist in a case, State v. Horne, who was a prisoner in Hawaii where there was evidence that the prison was totally out of control of the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.962" offset="13139257">Prisoners were walking around carrying guns and the argument was made that every prisoner in the place was in apprehension of serious bodily harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.476" offset="13173321">And the Court in Horne said that that can go to the jury, a duress defense can go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.241" offset="13204355">But the difference between that case and the case the Chief Justice has mentioned is that the authorities were totally out of control, there are no legitimate avenues of review.</text>

            <text syncTime="3298.513" offset="13297455">Now, I do want to make a point about the Government's other intent theory, the whole specific general intent controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.789" offset="13322533">The Government has not been consistent on their theory since this whole matter began.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.159" offset="13339982">The trial judge instructed the jury that the intent element was that they must have acted consciously and not inadvertently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.290" offset="13376554">On appeal they argued that there were three levels of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.850" offset="13394735">Consciousness and not inadvertence is the first the second is wrongful and the third is purpose or specific intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.937" offset="13427127">So they switched the, the theory it appears as though it was called the Arkansas situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.918" offset="13447084">We said that in our brief, that they are arguing on appeal in that the standard intent of law is wrongful and the jury was instructed that all they had to do was find consciousness and inadvertence, then that was called the Arkansas situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.449" offset="13505181">Today they have gone back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.404" offset="13513017">They have switched back, and today they have argued that the proper standard of intent is consciousness and inadvertence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.985" offset="13543320">Well, we think that alone would require reversal of the trial court and affirmance of the Court of Appeal's decision on intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.109" offset="13583757">But just to speak briefly to the specific intent issue, in many cases such as Woodring and Chapman even though the courts felt that the statute might not have covered specific intent, the juries were instructed in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.904" offset="13643003">The case went to the jury and in both those cases the jury came back with a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.653" offset="13662020">The whole point of the Court of Appeals attempt here was to clarify the law and to get away from the labels of specific intent and general intent which really are meaningless unless you try to figure out what the purpose of the crime is, what the purpose of the offense is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.812" offset="13734640">And the Court quite recently said, well, in the escape statute what society is trying to do is punish someone who escapes with the intent to avoid confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.301" offset="13772570">If he escapes for another reason, to save his skin, essentially it is a self-defense measure, then the matter is not what Congress intended to punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.785" offset="13810500">It is really no different than what Judge Wilkey described as the free will of these compulsive notion of intent, that if you escape because of some form of coercion that creates in your mind a reasonable apprehension of fear of death or bodily injury, then you don't have the requisite state of mind and perhaps you don't pose the same threat to society as someone who just gets out and wants to regain his freedom and goes for broke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.475" offset="13925230">And I must point out that anyone who escapes, if he commits other crimes while he is out, of course is subject to prosecution for those crimes and will be treated the same as anybody else.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3474.930" offset="14003075">I would just like to make a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.469" offset="14017285">The Government did not concede voluntariness as an element of the crime of escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.217" offset="14036198">What we contended was that the intent was an element of the crime of escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.485" offset="14053334">The intent to do the act in the escape context is intent to avoid confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.774" offset="14078516">Voluntariness -- when a person is compelled to do something because of external forces, he still intends to do the act but he is excused from liability for that under the duress defense, under the affirmative defense of duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.164" offset="14144031">I would also like to point out that the Government has not conceded in this case that the evidence presented constituted satisfaction of the immediacy requirement of the duress defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.517" offset="14189484">And, in response to Mr. Justice Stevens' question, the Court of Appeals did find that the evidence presented to the jury was adequate to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.758" offset="14270360">The District Court did not have occasion to rule on that question and the Government did not focus on it at the trial court level because the focus was on the return requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.393" offset="14308916">And, finally, I would like to reiterate that the significance of the return requirement again is not simply that it is evidence that the prisoner's intent when he first left the jail was in fact to just get free rather than to avoid harsh conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.566" offset="14373595">The return requirement is a subsequent development of the defense of duress itself and there has to be adequate evidence presented in the record on every element of affirmative defense in order for the judge to send that defense to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3591.744" offset="14470353">Well, again I think it might depend on the type of duress to which he was subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.257" offset="14492400">If the duress he is claiming is a threat from one inmate who had just gone mad or something on occasion, I don't think there would be any particular excuse for remaining at large very long after that because it would be possible to simply climb out of a window or whatever the avenue of escape was and go around to the front door and say, so and so has --</text>
