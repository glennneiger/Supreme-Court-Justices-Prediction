            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="12.676" offset="50678">Well, this case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.634" offset="70531">It has to do with Los Angeles discharged of its sewage into the Pacific Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.227" offset="100833">Under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, the Environmental Protection Agency, upon specified conditions may issue a permit for the discharge of pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.477" offset="165825">The permit in fact was issued to the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.060" offset="180140">The case centers, however, on the ultimate termination of the Pacific Ocean discharge and the possible alternative deposit of sludge in a landfill site.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.984" offset="227892">The issue was essentially one of the administrative laws and it involves the right to a public hearing and concerns expressed by environmentalist who are opposed to bringing the ocean discharge to an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.682" offset="282645">The Court of Appeals held that EPA was required to justify every failure to hold a hearing on a permit action by proof that the material facts supporting the Act and I quote "are not subject to dispute."</text>
            <text syncTime="88.451" offset="353802">We disagree with that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.912" offset="363624">And in an opinion filed today, the reasons for our disagreement are set forth at some length. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.</text>
