            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear argument next in 79-5364, Brown v. Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.047" offset="303522">Mr. Lawrence, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="52.804" offset="314598">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.146" offset="399966">The issue in this case is whether to apply the Court's ruling in Burch v. Louisiana that a verdict of five out of six on a bobtail jury should be applied retroactively to this case, and if so if any other cases are involved, whether there should be full retroactivity or limited retroactivity to cases pending but not yet filed at the time that Burch was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.150" offset="536012">Darnell Brown was convicted in Orleans Parish of simple burglary by five-to-one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.202" offset="572165">He was then multiple-billed and sentenced to serve 22 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.651" offset="594004">We are relying on the rule in Hankerson v. North Carolina as the rule to apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.427" offset="633083">Similarly, we are relying on the rule in Witherspoon and Ballew v. Georgia, as well as Burch v. Louisiana.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="141.042" offset="667564">In which case did we define or at least tried to give some guidance on retroactivity?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="148.071" stopTime="282.540">
            <label>Mr. John M. Lawrence</label>
            <text syncTime="148.071" offset="695672">In Stovall v. Denno the guidelines came out, the criterion to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.432" offset="729109">In Ballew v. Georgia, the statistics came out, and in Burch the five-out-of-six decision was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.582" offset="769651">But in Stovall and later with Linkletter, the Court drew on three factors the purpose to be served by the new rule, the reliance on good faith by the state authorities on the old rule, and the effect on the administration of criminal justice by implementing the new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.440" offset="893158">In Hankerson, the Court looked to the purpose of the new rule and that if that purpose was to enhance the truth of the fact-finding matter, then you need not look to reliance and effect, and that if the purpose was only to incidentally enhance the truth finding function or if it was small, then you would consider the other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.377" offset="1064835">We submit here that we are in a better position than the litigant in Hankerson because we are not concerned with just an incidental enhancement of the truth finding function.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.176" offset="1124080">If you will recall in Ballew when the statistics were mentioned, they talk about prevention of type one error which is that an innocent man should not be wrongfully convicted being weighed ten times more heavily than the prevention of the type two error that a guilty person should go free.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.683" offset="1242154">That was in Ballew.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.354" offset="1256782">That came out of Ballew from the statistics that the Court considered in making its decision.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="296.147" offset="1287920">But was it this Court's statement that it should be a ten-to-one ratio?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="301.250" stopTime="481.718">
            <label>Mr. John M. Lawrence</label>
            <text syncTime="301.250" offset="1308400">No, it is not this Court's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.061" offset="1319581">That is the statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.117" offset="1355839">The fact remains that the enhancement here is not incidental or small, that the unanimity requirement, where do you draw the line, the unanimity requirement in a bobtail jury is where you draw the line, whether it is six of six or five out of six, as in the case of Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.242" offset="1480391">Now, when you look at the reliance by state authorities, after Ballew and Williams v. Florida, they were put on notice that unanimity was being favored and not five out of six any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.420" offset="1581014">That is the reason that the motion to quash the five-out-of-six panel requirement was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.700" offset="1642141">The purpose also in Burch was to assure accuracy in jury verdicts, to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impaired the truth finding function, and raised serious doubts about prior trials, where five out of six would convict someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.731" offset="1722284">That is the reason for Ballew and Burch.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.519" offset="1741406">So here we are on similar ground with Hankerson, that the purpose of Burch is to enhance the fact-finding process, but if the Court would look at the other factors, such as the reliance and the effect on the administration of justice, you should consider this, that we are talking about really two states here, Louisiana and Oklahoma, who have the five out of six requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.946" offset="1895111">Most of the people who were convicted five of six have already served their sentences and are out of prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.887" offset="1926875">Some people who have been multiple-billed are not, but most of the people who were convicted are already out.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.992" offset="1947355">We are talking about a period of time between 1974 and 1978 and we are not talking about people charged with relative felonies who pled guilty or who were convicted six to nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.619" offset="2001899">We are talking only about five-one, so there is a relatively small number of people that we are talking about here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.071" offset="7391692">Your Honor, I believe that the ultimate issue in this case is whether nine unanimous jury verdicts are inaccurate, are unjust, if there is a good chance that they are erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.276" offset="7444459">In this case there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.552" offset="7461595">The gist of what petitioner argues therefore is that in a substantial number of cases there must be error to justify wholesale and a windfall reversal of prior convictions, a substantial number of prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.984" offset="7519274">The state concedes that there is no question that the Sixth Amendment that was the subject of Burch v. Louisiana pertains to what has been called the fact-finding process by this Court, but we submit also that it is well settled that the mere fact that the Sixth Amendment or the fact-finding process is involved in a particular ruling does not mandate automatic retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.226" offset="7620315">Since it would be improper and impossible to review all of the convictions and the records of all the convictions, we have to look at this issue in general terms from what the jurisprudence has taught us about the jury trial and in functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.510" offset="7677367">The purpose of the jury trial is to prevent government oppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.623" offset="7705893">The main feature of the jury trial is an interposition between the accused and the accuser, of what this Court has called the common sense deliberations of a group of laymen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.931" offset="7747062">The Court has further ruled that this interposition can operate if the jury can deliberate effectively and if it fairly represents a cross-section of the community from which it has been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.364" offset="7800874">Many of these features are functions of the absolute size of the jury rather than the composition of the final ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.044" offset="7831594">For example, it has been established that by empaneling six jurors, the cross-section requirement is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.785" offset="7862523">And I believe the Court has rejected the argument that the fact that a member of the minority group is ultimately out-voted does not indicate that his position was not or the position of the minority was not adequately represented during the jury deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.094" offset="7931800">The Court in Ballew expressed some concern about the collective memory of the jury, and I think it has been further established that when six persons are empaneled they are able when they go back to that deliberation room to remember all the facts and arguments that were important in the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.762" offset="8002435">Also the state would suggest that it can't be said that a lay body has failed to interpose itself between accused and accuser, whether the final verdict is unanimous or non-unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.865" offset="8050813">Reading Burch together with this Court's prior decisions suggests that, while unanimous jury verdicts may indicate that more perfect deliberation processes occur, that the extent to which non-unanimous jury verdicts infect the integrity of the fact-finding process ranks low on the scale of probabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.147" offset="8147989">The language of the Burch decision supports this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.626" offset="8157915">The majority opinion of Mr. Justice Rehnquist at several points noted that the case was a close one, but went on to state that it was necessary to draw lines, that demarcation lines had to be drawn at some point if the substance of the trial was to be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.916" offset="8223013">The State of Louisiana would liken the rule of Burch to the rule of Callahan v. Parker as interpreted in Gosa v. Mayden, and that is that it is a prophylactic rule that only incidentally enhances the reliability of the fact-finding process.</text>
