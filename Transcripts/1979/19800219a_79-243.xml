            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">We will hear arguments next in Richmond Newspapers, Incorporated, against Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.899" offset="283961">Mr. Tribe, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="48.033" offset="296500">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.387" offset="313950">This is an appeal by the Richmond newspapers, and two of its reporters, who were expelled, along with all other members of the public, from an entire murder trial in September of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.052" offset="364628">It was the fourth time that the defendant had been brought to trial for the murder of a local hotel manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.358" offset="389810">And his case had already been extensively described in the local press.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.095" offset="408827">On motion of defense counsel, without objections by the prosecutor, the trial judge closed the entire trial on the authority of a Virginia statute which gives trial courts discretion to treat all observers as, and I quote the language of the statute, persons whose presence would impair the conduct of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.575" offset="502659">At the end of a two-day secret trial, the trial judge excused the jury, declared the defendant not guilty of murder, and set him free.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.746" offset="555426">On petitions for appeal -- mandamus and prohibition -- appellants sought to prevent their recurring exclusion from complete criminal trials by urging the Supreme Court of Virginia to hold such closure unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.355" offset="613836">The State, in a memorandum and a brief, defended the closure on the express authority of the Virginia statute that had been invoked by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.315" offset="657617">And the Virginia Supreme Court summarily upheld the closure, citing only this Court's one-week-old decision in Gannett.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.476" offset="702339">Although the Virginia statute and the Attorney General of Virginia speak in terms of fair trial in this case, there was no specific risk of unfairness whatever, either demonstrated or found below.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.562" offset="774646">The problems that were noted, either by defense counsel or by the trial court, were three types.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.877" offset="815919">First, there were suggestions, which appellants submit are incompatible with the concept of public trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.219" offset="857297">For example, the trial judge's comment that the courtroom layout might make observers distracting since jurors could see them a courtroom which for some two and one-half centuries had been used for open criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.718" offset="927305">Second, there were suggested difficulties that closing the trial simply could not have solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.548" offset="958548">I have in mind here defense counsel's concern that one or more of the prior trials had in some way been spoiled by inadmissible evidence, or by jury exposure to pretrial publicity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="227.455" stopTime="231.726">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="227.455" offset="1014241">Was this trial held in the same courtroom as the prior trials?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="231.726" offset="1031272">It was, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.016" offset="1036497">It was held under the same judge as the second and third trials, but a different judge than the one who presided over the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.098" offset="1064814">It was only the first trial that went to judgment, a judgment of conviction that was ultimately reversed.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="245.488" offset="1086339">Where is Hanover County?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="247.398" stopTime="261.687">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="247.398" offset="1093966">It's some miles from Richmond, and it's a rural county.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.776" offset="1111521">One of the points, indeed, made by the Attorney General is that because it's a small community problems of prejudicial publicity might be greater.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="261.687" stopTime="265.687">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="261.687" offset="1151122">Well, some -- that's like, most places are some miles --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="265.687" stopTime="329.476">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="265.687" offset="1167109">I'm afraid I have not been in Hanover County, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.227" offset="1185290">Finally, there were suggestions of problems that could obviously have been solved by devices that were far less restrictive than closure.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.575" offset="1222698">Defense counsel expressed particular fear that jurors might receive misleading or prejudicial information of some kind between trial sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.518" offset="1262508">There was no suggestion that jurors could not possibly be insulated during a trial, especially of this brief duration, from persons who might give them prejudicial or misleading information.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.298" offset="1317575">Now, if this record justifies the closure of an entire murder trial, then frankly, it's rather hard to imagine one that would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.501" offset="1358430">The basic question that is therefore presented is, whether complete criminal trials can be held in secret, simply because defense counsel has moved for closure, and the prosecution has not objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.327" offset="1409735">That is what the statute in this case authorized.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="329.476" offset="1422273">Well, I thought the court had to decide.</text>

          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="332.217" stopTime="346.965">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="332.217" offset="1433245">It's in the court's discretion, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.613" offset="1438887">And the question is whether that discretion can be conferred upon a trial court to close the trial simply for that reason, on a record like this which shows no special risk of unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.282" offset="1481519">And I think it's important to stress what questions are not involved here --</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="348.521" stopTime="349.486">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="348.521" offset="1498446">No, not automatically closed, Mr. Justice.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="349.486" offset="1502312">If the defendant asks that it be closed, and the prosecutor doesn't object.</text>

          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="353.480" stopTime="513.988">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="353.480" offset="1518299">No the trial judge still has discretion to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.762" offset="1527495">But indeed, when we move to the First Amendment, I think that will be an important part of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.262" offset="1545467">But it is a discretionary decision by an agent of government whether there shall or shall not be public awareness of what goes on in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.994" offset="1580366">The question, then, is whether the whole trial can be closed not whether disorderly observers can be expelled not whether witnesses can be asked to leave while other witnesses are testifying not whether a particular portion of the trial can be closed not whether certain members of the public can be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.810" offset="1655599">The question is really a rather wholesale one, and it's in that posture that the case reaches this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.843" offset="1679736">Now, because the Court postponed consideration of jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits, I want to begin by addressing this question of whether this case is properly here under 1257(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="407.770" offset="1735429">As Chief Justice Marshall said in the Blackbird Creek case in 1829, it might have been safer, it might have avoided any question respecting jurisdiction, to have stated in terms that the act was repugnant to the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.478" offset="1798332">Surely it would have been safer here not to have omitted that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.239" offset="1825395">It is true that the appellants below never said, in so many words, this statute violates the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.935" offset="1856115">But the question before this Court is whether the constitutional validity of that statute was drawn in question, and whether the decision was in favor of its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.822" offset="1899687">And we submit that the answer, to both of those questions is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.447" offset="1914211">The trial court cited only this statute as authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.894" offset="1931975">The court said the statute specifically authorizes the closure of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.857" offset="1947857">So this is not a case where there is merely a general authorizing statute, like one conferring jurisdiction to regulate, or jurisdiction to tax, which is somehow gratuitously dragged in by hindsight.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.674" offset="1999057">This is a case where the statute by its terms bears the infirmity that concerns us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.620" offset="2022881">Nor did the State claim in the Virginia Supreme Court that the action of the trial court was somehow a lawless aberration.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.966" offset="2060288">In the court below, as in this Court, the State says that the closure was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.493" offset="2082335">And indeed, in the Virginia Supreme Court, in defending its legality, both the prosecution's brief opposing appeal and the Attorney General's memorandum, opposing mandamus and prohibition, defended the legality of closure under State law solely as an exercise of authority which was literally conferred by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.821" offset="2159658">It defended the statute --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="513.988" stopTime="522.510">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="513.988" offset="2160389">We have appellant jurisdiction, whether the statute is invalid on its face or whether it's invalid as applied, do we not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="522.510" offset="2194453">I think in this case, invalidity as construed and as enforced, is all that we claim, Mr. Justice.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="530.889" offset="2227994">That's enough.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="532.042" offset="2232592">That's certainly enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.636" offset="2238966">And we're not claiming that every possible interpretation or application would be void.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.575" offset="2262685">But the statute was defended in the trial -- in the court below as construing, broadly enough to uphold this closure, on the ground that it was a needed limit to the quote public's right to know, unquote.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.778" offset="2323498">And even in this Court, the Attorney General is not, as we understand it, disavowing this broad reading of the statute, or his defense of its constitutional validity when read this broadly.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.030" offset="2372504">Going to the matter of breadth, Mr. Tribe, tell me whether I correctly gathered from what you said before, that you're not arguing that never under any circumstances or conditions can a part of a trial be closed?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="584.393" offset="2441989">That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice; a part of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.119" offset="2452856">We are arguing that at least thus far we have been unable to imagine any circumstances in which an entire criminal trial can be closed.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="595.486" offset="2486293">Well, can you imagine circumstances in which a total public audience of 40 can be seated and a hundred others want to get in, but they would have to stand around the edges.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.858" offset="2527880">And the trial judge says, "Those who can be seated, be seated be seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.930" offset="2540105">But we're not going to have standing."</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="610.427" stopTime="920.803">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="610.427" offset="2546061">Certainly, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.348" offset="2549823">Indeed, one of the earliest proceedings in this courtroom, one in which Patrick Henry delivered an impassioned plea against the tyranny of the King, was rather of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.267" offset="2589424">There wasn't room for all the people who wanted to attend some were asked to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.571" offset="2602695">But those who could be seated, and could remain orderly, were allowed to remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.498" offset="2618368">In this case, however orderly the observers, all were told to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.008" offset="2652432">The suggestion, as I gather it, by the Attorney General is, it would have been nice if the Supreme Court of Virginia had been given an opportunity to narrow the statute down somehow, and that it would have been given a better opportunity to do that, had we brought it into question instead of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.746" offset="2711364">But it's I think inconceivable that it would have made any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.997" offset="2732366">No particular narrow reading was suggested by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.463" offset="2746264">The Attorney General's position is this statute authorized this closure.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.684" offset="2763086">And it would have been a rather pointless act for the Supreme Court of Virginia to say this closure was okay, but the statute is not broad enough to sustain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.699" offset="2803210">We sustain it under some other kind of common law authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.135" offset="2812928">That would have made enactment of the statute a pointless legislative exercise on the part of the Virginia legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.702" offset="2843230">So nothing really could have turned in this case on the form in which the validity of the statute was read.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.552" offset="2870606">It was necessarily, therefore, upheld by the Supreme Court of Virginia, when the Court denied appeal, mandamus and prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.862" offset="2899864">And even with that not true, the case would clearly be here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.889" offset="2919926">So let me then turn to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.954" offset="2932255">The Virginia Supreme Court upheld this trial closure and denied relief against recurring trial closures, citing only this Court's decision in Gannett.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.795" offset="2975619">I must say, that seems a baffling conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.384" offset="2993904">Because of course Gannett involved a pretrial suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.459" offset="3014280">No amount of dictum about trials would have permitted the decision in Gannett to resolve an issue that was not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.664" offset="3047090">The majority opinion twice described the question presented as one about pretrial suppression proceedings only.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.283" offset="3081571">And the concluding statement of the holding was equally narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.723" offset="3095259">As the Chief Justice obeyed in his concurring opinion, that made all the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.256" offset="3113441">And the reason that I would submit it must make a very great deal of difference is, implicit in the purposes and the character and the available alternatives in the two different settings.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.937" offset="3168193">Ultimately, the purposes of a pretrial suppression hearing are to keep inadmissible information from the jury, as a cross-section of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.762" offset="3203406">In contrast, the purpose of the trial itself is to expose admissible information to the jury as a cross-section of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.241" offset="3241336">As a result, the character of the pre-trial proceeding is almost that of an internal governmental mechanism, whereas the character of the trial in chief is the very opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.406" offset="3297970">Finally, there are difficulties, inescapably, about, minimizing prejudice arising out of the airing of potentially inadmissible information at a pretrial hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.369" offset="3345826">There are devices available and this Court has spoken of them in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.349" offset="3357842">Sequestration is not available because the jury isn't chosen yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.194" offset="3373202">But there are devices available Changing venue; screening jurors through questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.967" offset="3396295">But the difficulty is that they are of uncertain efficacy, and if one must err on the side of fair trial, it seems to follow for some that the public may be excluded as a mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.491" offset="3454391">But the tension between publicity and fairness ceases when the trial begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.887" offset="3475916">As this Court pointed out in the Gannett opinion, a panoply of devices is then available, including sequestering the jury, in order to avoid any form of prejudicial information from reaching the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.113" offset="3540804">So that all of the general references to the central role of fairness in our system in the Attorney General's brief, I submit, are beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.726" offset="3587302">We're devoted to fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.883" offset="3595975">But fair trial does not require closed trial, given the devices that are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.763" offset="3623455">Now, even if there were no sharp dichotomies, no basic distinction between pretrial suppression hearings on the one hand and the trial on the other even if one viewed them all as part of the same proceeding, I think it's also striking that a majority of the members of this Court in Gannett agreed, though on differing theories, agreed at least that there must be a substantial showing of need before either a trial or a pretrial proceeding can be closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.990" offset="3744350">And on this record there was no substantial showing of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.872" offset="3755844">So without even drawing a distinction between pretrial suppression hearings and trials in chief, this Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.038" offset="4208598">And the reason I don't think that question was definitively resolved in Gannett is twofold first, inasmuch as this Court has not yet held that even the accused has a right, before the criminal prosecution begins, to insist upon publicity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.019" offset="7424481">Your Honor, the Appellants take the position in this case that the Bill of Rights is for the public, but I think their argument ignores the one person at whom most of the Bill of Rights is aimed, John Paul Stevenson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.014" offset="7480487">Now, there are two broad claims that can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.257" offset="7493444">One is the trial court could never be closed and the other is the trial courts can be closed without a hearing and without a hearing or without any reason or opportunity for the public to protest and argue against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.529" offset="7550495">It seems to me that in this case that the second argument is never reached because this is the first case, in my knowledge in Virginia, where a criminal proceeding has been closed in the guise of a full trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.152" offset="7617055">There is a tradition that exists that is inviolate and as long as I am Attorney General I am sure it will be continued that the judge in this case was concerned and confronted with several difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.591" offset="7670763">Here were very unusual and narrow facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.497" offset="7682361">Someone who had been tried four times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.776" offset="7691452">On the first occasion, the trial had gone up to the Supreme Court on appeal and because a bloody shirt had been introduced on the basis of hearsay evidence, the case was sent back for retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.809" offset="7731681">There was a second, subsequent mistrial because one of the jurors became sick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.449" offset="7754146">There was a third mistrial because the jury was poisoned by finding out about prejudicial information that should not come forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.274" offset="7785493">And then, in this fourth occasion, the judge was confronted with the defense attorney, with the agreement of the prosecutor, asking that trial be closed so his rights could be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.927" offset="7840141">Now, if difficulties had occurred in this trial and if the motion had not been granted, certainly, difficulties could have come to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2730.015" offset="11024468">I think, first, that if, when the Supreme Court, in reviewing what incidentally was not an attack on the statute, and we have made the point in our brief that this is not a proper case for appeal because that statute was never even mentioned by the Appellants in the case, it was not cited it was not attacked, we cannot say --</text>

            <text syncTime="2757.037" offset="11132510">But it strikes me that the Supreme Court can be said to have viewed this as within the Gannett exemption and that being when the prosecutor, the defense attorney and the judge agree that it is necessary for a fair trial and when it is cast against the publicity, the problems they had had with mistrials in the past, that the Supreme Court did not find reversible error.</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.407" offset="11345983">Well, I think that in this case they were not prepared to say that a common law interest and a tradition in open trials which has many beneficial effects, and this Court has agreed with that, when it is in confrontation with the right to have a fair trial, that all parties of interest in that case, representing the public interest, the judge and the defendant felt was necessary, that the Supreme Court was not going to again say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.760" offset="11471475">Now, I think that it is certainly the case that maverick orders and decisions that depart from that can be corrected by State Court rules or by legislation as we have proposed in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.690" offset="11535109">But I don't think a Constitutional rule would be inflexibility that is obviously accompanied with laying that rule down as something that is needed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.283" offset="11581503">It would raise a whole host of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.500" offset="11590384">First of all, if the First Amendment applies, that could be a limitless right that would spill over into many, many areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.521" offset="13078528">And the judge, in view of all of that, felt that he would go ahead and close the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.630" offset="13106949">He certainly gave deference to any interest that the public would have in a public trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3277.779" offset="13215514">But it is simply the position of the State that this judgment should not be reversed that in this case all the considerations that could be taken into account were taken into account by the Court, and that it does not reflect a policy of not giving due respect to the public interest in a public trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.893" offset="13315929">And for that reason, we urge that on the merits the case should not be reversed, and we would also urge that from a procedural standpoint, since we do not know what construction the State Supreme Court would have placed on this statute if it had been contested by the Appellants, we do not believe that it is appropriate for this case to come on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.896" offset="13420001">We also think, since the jurisdictional question has been reserved that the certiorari ought not to be granted in this case because there needs to be sufficient time for the State to respond to the Gannett decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.908" offset="13696063">The position I think that the Attorney General is taking has nothing to do with the fact the accused wanted a private trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.783" offset="13719573">Under their view, even if the accused -- if the judge simply said, "I don't want anybody to know", there would be no First Amendment violation because they think the First Amendment really protects only speech, and this Court has repeatedly held otherwise, in Virginia Board of Pharmacy, in Lamont, and a number of other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.593" offset="13786760">It seems to me that when you add the defendant's request, it doesn't change anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.044" offset="13800552">It is just a request by a private individual to invoke a censorial power which, by this Court's own decisions in cases like Lamont, would not be acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.506" offset="13842453">I think the more general point is that the Constitutional philosophy which the Attorney General espouses is really upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.328" offset="13869725">It is his posture that this Court should be a problem solver and wait until complicated problems arise and fashion a solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.208" offset="13893235">That is not my understanding of this Court's role.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.556" offset="13902639">This Court should articulate what the Constitution has traditionally meant, and it has traditionally meant what was perhaps too obvious to put in so many words that criminal trials are to be public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.849" offset="13947779">The First Amendment provides a perfect textual home for that principle, due process would do as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.034" offset="13972543">And a violation of publicity here is surely not rectified by the existence of a taperecording.</text>
