            <text syncTime="21.930" offset="191091">As to the question of Robertson v. Wegmann, the subject of the survival in the case was death caused by an extraneous cause, not by the actual claim brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.784" offset="238529">In other words, the person didn't die as a result of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.738" offset="250337">The claim was brought and the person died later on and that question was left directly open.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.718" offset="270294">Also, the Lousiana statute, which was the subject of the survival case in Robertson allowed for many people to bring the action, including parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.561" offset="309582">So if we were operating under the Louisiana statute here, Joe Jones could bring a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.845" offset="334764">The problem with Indiana, nobody can bring a survival claim.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="60.538" offset="345527">But the claim couldn't be brought in Robertson at all, could it, because there just didn't happen to be that kind of a person around.</text>

            <text syncTime="71.240" offset="388368">Right, there was nobody.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.252" offset="392338">But there was a lot of different people who could have brought the claim, including parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.199" offset="412191">As to the question of congressional intent and exclusivity, every time the Congress has wanted the FTCA to be exclusive they have specifically stated in the act or in amendments -- and I refer the Court to 28 U.S.C. 2679 --</text>

            <text syncTime="93.605" offset="477811">But that doesn't necessarily answer the question of whether the Court should imply a cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.476" offset="493275">No, not necessarily but it is important to look to congressional intent to determine whether --</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="102.286" offset="512502">And the other reason for not implying it maybe, if they thought it should be exclusive, but it is not the only reason for not having an implied action.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Deutsch</label>
            <text syncTime="109.848" offset="542804">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.317" offset="544684">I would think, whether there is an equally effective remedy is the real question.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.707" offset="566209">But in talking about congressional intent, not only did they specifically state so when they wanted it to be exclusive as to a Bivens claim, the 1974 amendments specifically recognizes that Bivens -- it is a counterpart to Bivens, and the Senate report specifically says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.287" offset="628485">The other thing about congressional intent is that Congress is in fact involved in negotiations with the Justice Department about making it exclusive, and in the course of that there are all kinds of broad changes being made in the act so it will take up the question of deterrence and compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.483" offset="701315">Both the government and the Congress have both agrees that as it exists now the FTCA is not equally effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.323" offset="740707">You've spoken three or four times about its being equally effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.580" offset="757739">I assume you mean would be the most productive in terms of the survivors, is that what you mean?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="177.748" offset="814373">Well, as a practical matter -- and I suppose this is anyone's judgment -- wouldn't a judgment for, say, $50,000 against the United States government be worth considerably more than a judgment in a much larger amount against four or five civil servants?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Deutsch</label>
            <text syncTime="197.729" offset="894307">Well, it would maybe address the question of compensation, but the question of deterrence which is one of the twin goals of suing under the Constitution would not be accomplished because there is no deterrence to these men who have committed these violations of citizens' constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.693" offset="970167">The question of common law of survival, if the Court looks at the Fifth Amendment, which says no one shall be deprived of life without due process of law, how else could someone sue for damage, for the deprivation of life under the Fifth Amendment if there wasn't in effect some recognition that there had to be some common law of survival?</text>
            <text syncTime="240.501" offset="1065357">What you are saying, if you apply Indiana law, is there is a constitutional violation if the person lives but if the person dies there isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.628" offset="1097853">That seems to fly right into the face of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Deutsch</label>
            <text syncTime="254.951" offset="1123140">Your Honor, probably, but when we are talking about the enforcement of fundamental rights under the Fifth and Eighth Amendments, I would think a statute --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="262.215" offset="1152188">Sometimes the rights, the difference between the constitutional right and the statutory right in all practical terms are virtually indistinguishable, are they not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_e_deutsch" startTime="273.029" stopTime="326.554">
            <label>Mr. Michael E. Deutsch</label>
            <text syncTime="273.029" offset="1195447">That would be true, and 1983 certainly enforces the constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.352" offset="1212792">But if we don't have such a statute here, we have a statute that is based on state negligence law, and when we are talking about enforcing constitutional rights it is not adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.184" offset="1256155">I also address the Court to 28 U.S.C. 2676 of the Tort Claims Act which recognizes that if you get a recovery against the government you cannot sue against the individual employee, which recognizes that they are coexhisting remedies but you can't get double recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.311" offset="1340583">So if you go under the Tort Claims Act, you are precluded from going against the individual employee which imports of recognition you could choose either one, depending on what you thought was your interest in terms of deterrence and compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.848" offset="1454791">In Bivens, there was absolutely no federal remedy because Congress hadn't amended the Tort Claims Act yet to include intentional torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.342" offset="1488750">Secondly, the Court said in Bivens that state trespass and invasion of privacy laws were not adequate to compensate victims of Fourth Amendment violations because such state laws were often inconsistent or even hostile to the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.372" offset="1548831">The respondent here has never alleged much less shown why state malpractice laws are not adequate to compensate for the sorts of violations and injuries that occurred here.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.910" offset="1670980">We think that this is the sort of a case that the Court had in mind in Carey v.
