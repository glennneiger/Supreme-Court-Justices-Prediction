            <text syncTime="33.142" offset="235917">Mr. Justice Dooley, at page A7 of his opinion as it appears in the petition for certiorari seems to be defining lesser included offense under the concept of double jeopardy, and I submit to you that one of his errors is that he misdefines it.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.441" offset="329122">He speaks in terms of what the fact of the lesser offense must usually contain and no element not found in the greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.539" offset="373530">And I would submit to this Honorable Court that it is abundantly clear from the cases such as Brown v. Ohio, such as, for example, Virgin Islands v. Acquino in the intermediate appellate court, that for double jeopardy purposes the lesser included offense situation is thusly defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.744" offset="470392">The greater offense will always and of necessity include all of the elements of the lesser.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.091" offset="687731">Well, he says, in any event, in this case the lesser offense requires no proof beyond that which is necessary for a conviction of the greater.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.283" offset="744469">Certainly the corollary is not true, that the manslaughter charge requires proof of the homicide, whereas the lesser included offense doesn't to have a homicide or even an accident.</text>

            <label>Mr. James S. Veldman</label>
            <text syncTime="173.977" offset="799326">Yes, the so-called lesser included offense involves no element of death, it doesn't even necessarily involve an element of collision with any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.125" offset="843839">The so-called greater offense, on the other hand, can be easily proven in a number of instances without proving the lesser, since voluntary manslaughter, as Your Honors can see defined statutorily, and I have set it out at page 16 of our principal brief, clearly you can commit involuntary manslaughter in Illinois easily without the use of an automobile and therefore under no stretch of the imagination.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.100" offset="987721">First of all, in the statute which is set out at page A6 in the petition, there is an "(a)" on the manslaughter and there is a "(b)" that says, "If the acts which cause the death consist of the driving of a motor vehicle," and then it goes on, which is I take it a sub-category of the voluntary manslaughter.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="276.065" offset="1207672">In other words, what I am suggesting is a sort of a pyramid, the broadest category is the involuntary manslaughter, included within that category is the species reckless homicide and an even lesser within that category is the reckless driving of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.799" offset="1270575">Each is lesser of the next step up.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.591" offset="1281755">Well, perhaps if we had the reckless driving of the vehicle, you might have an instance where it might be an included offense, but what I think you cannot -- even in Your Honor's pyramid of setting up sub-categories, you cannot make failing to reduce speed a lesser included offense even a reckless homicide because all that you are talking about in failure to reduce speed is a simple violation of due care by not reducing speed even to avoid, say, an empty wagon which on the highway.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.179" offset="1540054">Well, I think a great many things, as Your Honor can see at page 17 in the people's principal brief, there are a great many things which are included within this particular section of the Illinois Vehicle Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.601" offset="1597733">And I think there are a number of separate and distinct offenses which might be committed under this section.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.591" offset="1621765">The question is, I suppose -- let me put it a little differently -- the indictment for manslaughter that is quoted on page 4 of the appendix alleges that John M. Vitale has on or about so-and-so committed the offense of involuntary manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.049" offset="1683519">In that, he without lawful justification, while recklessly driving a motor vehicle, caused the death of George Kech.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.414" offset="6129037">This case has been all over and every conceivable argument that could have been made against John Vitale by the State of Illinois has been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1519.616" offset="6181804">Just to take a step backwards John Vitale was tried on the minor traffic violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.087" offset="6331747">But really what we would be talking about here would be multiple trials if the state would prevail on this final argument because as I say, they had gone from jurisdiction originally.</text>
