            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will now hear arguments in the State of Maine v Thiboutot.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.700" offset="398190">Mr. Smith, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Eastman Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="76.955" offset="411146">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.077" offset="419715">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.001" offset="431417">A Writ of Certiorari was granted to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court on January 21, 1980, in the above matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.852" offset="462764">Questions presented therein were threefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.152" offset="475930">First, whether the Petitioners' good faith violation of the Federal Social Security Act and its regulations, with the resulting incorrect reduction of AFDC benefits to the Respondents, but without a violation of Respondents' constitutional rights, constitutes a violation of 42 USC Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.547" offset="569553">The second question posed was whether the Civil Rights Act of 1976, 42 USC Section 1988, allows consideration of an award of attorney's fees to Respondents who prevail solely on a Social Security Act claim in an Action where no violation of constitutional rights is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.674" offset="654085">The final question was whether or not 42 USC Section 1983 affords Respondents a remedy in the State Court for a violation of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.655" offset="701942">The statement of the facts follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.973" offset="711241">The Respondents, Lionel and Joline Thiboutot, are married and have eight children.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.256" offset="732348">Four of those children are theirs pursuant to their common marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.898" offset="750947">Three of the children were brought into the common marriage pursuant to a prior marriage of Mr. Thiboutot's.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.066" offset="775607">One child was Mrs. Thiboutot's pursuant to a prior marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.027" offset="795460">In November of 1975, the State of Maine, Department of Human Services, reduced, or notified Mr. Thiboutot they were going to reduce, his benefits pursuant to a change in what we believe, deemed by Federal Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.269" offset="856482">They notified him of this proposed change.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.172" offset="872051">The change was as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.804" offset="882604">In computing the net available income of Mr. Thiboutot, in order to determine the amount of AFDC benefits to be allowed for his three children by a prior marriage, the Department would no longer subtract that portion of Mr. Thiboutot's income which went to the support of the four children by the common marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.754" offset="974346">The effect of this was to count as available, in the computation of the eligibility benefits, income which was actually unavailable due to Mr. Thiboutot's legal obligation to support his four mutual children.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.827" offset="1038712">After exhausting their administrative remedies, the Thiboutots, pursuant to a complaint filed in Superior Court, appealed the Department's decision and on their computation basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.411" offset="1105063">This appeal was brought originally pursuant to Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 80B, and two statutes which in and of themselves allow for the Maine State Courts to take jurisdiction of cases such as this the denial or a reduction of AFDC benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.919" offset="1179042">On January 7, 1977, an amended complaint was filed in the same Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.850" offset="1202761">This followed the enactment of the Civil Rights Attorneys Fees Act of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.607" offset="1229824">The amended complaint brought pursuant to 1983, as well as the other State Statutes which would have allowed jurisdiction in the State as well as the cause of action, alleged violation of the Social Security Act, regulations pertaining to the Social Security Act, and also asked for certification as a class action which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.833" offset="1326686">The Maine Superior Court entered judgment for the Thiboutots on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.070" offset="1347688">The Petitioners were enjoined from enforcing the challenged regulations; and in compliance with Court Order, adopted new regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.119" offset="1383842">The State also paid benefits, respectively, to all class members who were eligible; and also paid retroactive benefits to the Thiboutots.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.725" offset="1430235">However, another issue is still before the Court, and that issue is attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.525" offset="1453432">The Court in subsequent motion denied the Respondents' plea for attorney's fees, which was then appealed to the Supreme Judicial Court for the State of Maine.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="346.846" stopTime="350.609">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="346.846" offset="1490735">What other issues are here now, other than attorney's fees?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_eastman_smith" startTime="350.609" stopTime="572.380">
            <label>Mr. James Eastman Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="350.609" offset="1505782">Whether or not Section 1983 applies -- or whether a violation of the Social Security Act is encompassed within the parameters of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.782" offset="1550503">The reason for this, your honor, is that the wording of Section 1988, the Attorneys Fees Awards Act, allows the discretionary award of attorney's fees in order to enforce a provision of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.257" offset="1612361">So without a violation of Section 1983, in this case, you would not have attorney's fees that could be awarded to Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.391" offset="1668890">The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine concluded that a right exists to sue under 42 USC 1983 in a state court that a similar right also exists to enforce the provisions of the Social Security Act, even though the claim is not of constitutional dimension; and that an award of attorney's fees for violation of the Social Security Act may be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.479" offset="1773275">A dispute over the computation of welfare benefits without a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, or any violation of Civil Rights, was not in the Petitioner's mind within the realm of foreseeability or within the intent of the legislators, drafters, and enactors of the predecessors of Section 1983, to wit, the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which was also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.576" offset="1901693">The historical background, and this Court is well aware of this, of the times when the 1871 Act was enacted during Reconstruction days, depicted a very sordid time in the history of this country; almost all rights that Blacks were to have enjoyed under the Fourteenth Amendment were not available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.799" offset="1990614">There were burnings there were pillages there were no rights of property that Negroes could enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.167" offset="2016005">This Court has recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.290" offset="2024573">However, in response thereto, Congress passed the Civil Rights Acts of 1866, the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1871, the Ku Klux Klan Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.521" offset="2081416">As this Court has said in Chapman v Houston Welfare Rights Organization, in cases of statutory construction, our task is to interpret the words of those statutes in light of the purposes Congress sought to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.013" offset="2135437">It is the State's contention that the purposes of the Ku Klux Klan Act, the predecessor of Section 1983, were to provide enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.179" offset="2176084">That Amendment is not at issue today.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.530" offset="2185488">There has been no due process violations or allegations thereof there have been no equal protection violations or allegations thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.478" offset="2221328">Another purpose of Section 1871 was to counteract violations of basic liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.149" offset="2247973">They are not at stake in this case or at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.714" offset="2262183">Another purpose of the Act of 1871 was to provide a remedy when a state law existed in theory, but was unavailable in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.331" offset="2304711">Here, in contrast, we have a state law that was available in practice it was available in reality; and indeed, the state law without Section 1983, afforded the Respondents the rights to appeal under the Fair Hearing Provisions and also to have the state's regulation overturned.</text>
