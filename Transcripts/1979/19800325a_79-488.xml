            <text syncTime="71.632" offset="389935">It is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.270" offset="396413">When the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brings a class action under section 706(f)(1) of the Civil Rights Act, does it have to comply with Rule 23, and we believe it requires a very short answer and that is yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="90.978" offset="467257">Let me ask you this, if I may, Mr. Dickens.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.071" offset="483662">Why would EEOC bring a class action?</text>
            <text syncTime="102.344" offset="512711">It is entitled to sue as a litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.537" offset="521488">I would have thought it could have gotten virtually all the benefits of its litigant status as a litigant on behalf of the government without denominating its action as a class action.</text>

            <label>Mr. James R. Dickens</label>
            <text syncTime="118.706" offset="578226">Your Honor, the government has not in the prayer or in the complaint said that it is a class action, but by the scope of the complaint and the relief requested, we believe that it is clear that it is a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.468" offset="629217">They moved at the trial court level to bifurcate the issue of class liability from the issue of individual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.587" offset="657742">We then moved to dismiss the class action aspects of the case and they acknowledge that they were seeking relief for a class and that is what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.829" offset="690657">We believe this is the way the statutory procedure is set up, they are seeking relief on behalf of an individual plus on behalf of the class.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="156.938" offset="731094">But by definition there is no individual in any conceivable class that the EEOC could represent other than itself, is there?</text>

            <label>Mr. James R. Dickens</label>
            <text syncTime="168.434" offset="777070">No, Your Honor, that is where we believe that what Congress has done in accordance with its power to supersede the federal rules in whole or in part, it has declared that the commission is a properly suing party and therefore to that extent they have superseded the requirement of Rule 23(a) that it be a member of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.515" offset="857422">As a consequence by statute we believe and we contend that Congress has made the commission a properly suing party under Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.989" offset="899323">Having taken that step, they are a properly suing party, it is the same as the Court has held, for example, in Hunt v. Washington State Apple Commission, associations, state agencies and so forth do have standing to bring suit on behalf of a class, even if technically they are not a member of the class.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.833" offset="2822666">Let me just briefly give the Court a little flavor for the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.350" offset="2836773">We mentioned some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.360" offset="2848789">We had four women employees in the Beaverton, Oregon facility file charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.466" offset="2881285">That is one facility out of 116 and that is in one state out of five that General Telephone operates in.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.147" offset="2907930">The commission investigated and when it concluded it wanted to file a broad-based action and the action is as broad as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.797" offset="2946591">It mentions no specifics, no dates, no individuals, and requests injunction, affirmative action, it requests that people be made whole who are adversely affected, and request back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.654" offset="3005942">We are not in this case questioning the scope of relief that can be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.023" offset="3023496">All we are trying to do quite frankly is avoid litigating this case now, in the future, and in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.927" offset="3047111">I would think -- there is no question that the court out our way doesn't want to try the case two or three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.525" offset="3069471">But if the class is not bound by any decision that is reached, they can relitigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.797" offset="3098520">Furthermore, this Court has continued to say, in talking about Title VII cases, two principles which we contend are very applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.009" offset="3135404">First of all, under Title VII it is the courts that are the final authority on Title VII and how it is implemented, and we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.454" offset="3169155">Secondly, this Court said in Rodriguez that the adherence to Rule 23 is indispensable -- the requirements of Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.033" offset="3207502">We agree, and that is what we are trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.852" offset="3222758">Now, here is what we have in this case, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.223" offset="3232266">I will give the Court I think a very concrete example of where in this situation the commission is making decisions that Congress intended the courts to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.226" offset="3268315">First of all, there is no question that because you allege something to be a class action, that does not make it a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.148" offset="3291930">We have good class action allegations and we have poor class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.950" offset="3311156">In this case, however, the commission has usurped the authority of the court in the class certification area by, number one, it said this is a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.952" offset="3351176">That is normally a determination court makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.254" offset="3360371">And number two, it said the scope of the class is this broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.485" offset="3381269">Now, we contend that those are requirements that Congress intended the courts have in making that determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="979.937" offset="4023150">Congress decided that the provisions under 706 permitting individuals to file suit was not working as well as it wanted, so we had the two approaches.</text>

            <text syncTime="1095.778" offset="4486457">As I mentioned earlier, we believe that had Congress intended to exempt the commission from Rule 23, it would have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.636" offset="4513938">It is clear that in the legislative history Congress made two specific references and changes in two federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.821" offset="4542673">It made a change in Rule 53 on special masters to insure that they would be able to handle these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1119.766" offset="4582484">What you get out of that, you are well aware that Congress knew about the federal rules and knew how to make exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.579" offset="4605680">It didn't make a similar exceptions for the commission under 706 for a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.931" offset="4635146">Now, it did talk about in several cases in the post history and throughout the committee reports that the commission is a properly suing party.</text>
