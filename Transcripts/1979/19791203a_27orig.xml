            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 27 Original, State of Ohio v. Commonwealth of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.198" offset="140204">Mr. Ringo, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Ringo</label>
            <text syncTime="31.033" offset="227453">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.207" offset="244172">This original action initiated by Ohio in 1966 is before the Court today on Kentucky's exceptions to the report of a special master.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.556" offset="285550">The issue before the Court is the location of the boundary between the two states along the northerly edge of the Ohio River.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.281" offset="320449">Ohio's claim, adopted by the report, is that the boundary is a fixed and static line located on the northerly low water mark as it existed in the year 1792.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.673" offset="370082">Kentucky contends that the boundary is the prevailing or current low water mark as it may exist at any given time as affected by the processes of accretion and erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.138" offset="423894">This Court in its 1973 opinion in this case rejected Ohio's attempt to amend its complaint to claim the middle of the river as the boundary and in so doing this Court held that the boundary between the two states was the northerly low water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.945" offset="483140">This was based on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.559" offset="493589">One, Ohio's long acquiescence to Kentucky's open assertions of sovereignty over the river, and the other was the Court's earlier decision in Handly's Lessee v. Anthony that held that the boundary between Indiana and Kentucky is the river itself, not the banks but the river itself, wherever that may be at the low water mark on the northwest edge.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.185" offset="580106">That decision was based on the cession made by Virginia and agreed to by the United States in 1784.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.093" offset="611767">This Court held that when Virginia ceded its lands northwest of the River Ohio to the national government, she intended to retain the entire river wherever it may be as the boundary between itself and unceded northwest territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.706" offset="666206">The river was to be a natural and ever-changing boundary for the convenience of the future population of the country and avoidance of controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.135" offset="699956">This holding in Handly simply reflects the universal commonlaw principle applied by this Court to state boundaries, that when a river serves as a boundary, the boundary follows the gradual changes in the river caused by accretion and erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.365" offset="764844">Besides this general rule of accretion, there are two other general principles relating to streams as boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.338" offset="796714">One is the principle of avulsion, which is when the boundary suddenly and perceptibly changes its old channel and adopts a new one, the boundary remains in the old channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.369" offset="840808">The other opinion -- the other principle set forth by this Court in Missouri v. Kentucky is a well-recognized exception to the rule of accretion and which was applied in Indiana v. Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.616" offset="893785">It is the abandoned or island rule, which is when a river gradually abandons its boundary channel and shifts around an island, adopting a new channel, the boundary remains in the original boundary channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.048" offset="951568">The result of this gradual shift of the channel of the river is the same as an avulsion.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.233" offset="972257">Nebraska v. Iowa came after that case, did it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="230.554" offset="1025546">The result of this gradual shift of the channel of the river is the same as an avulsion; that is, the boundary stays in the original channel, but it differs in that it occurs over a long period of time, rather than suddenly, as in an avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.685" offset="1082075">Ohio's position in this case is based upon a misconception of Indiana v. Kentucky and this recognized exception to the rule of accretion or the island rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.052" offset="1123558">So you are suggesting that the regular rule is that no one loses title, or a boundary doesn't change with respect to an island?</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Ringo</label>
            <text syncTime="391.818" offset="1670666">Ohio's position is based upon the misconception of Indiana v. Kentucky which is an important case to this discussion and the island rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.016" offset="1707447">In that case, it did not involve a determination of the entire boundary between the two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.285" offset="1728554">It involved a dispute over Green River Island, a 2,000-acre tract of land on the Indiana side of the Ohio River.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.060" offset="1759587">In that case, the Court found that when Kentucky became a state in 1792, the Ohio River ran in two channels north and south of the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.209" offset="1796159">The northern or boundary channel separated the island from the mainland of Indiana, but the river gradually abandoned the northern channel and by 1816, when Indiana became a state, the island had become attached to Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.038" offset="1855509">In applying the island rule, this Court held that the island was within Kentucky when it became a state and that subsequent abandonment of a boundary channel did not divest Kentucky of its dominion over the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.885" offset="1906918">The boundary remained along the northern river watermark of the river's abandoned channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.444" offset="1929174">Thus, Indiana v. Kentucky fixed only a land boundary along along the abandoned channel and did not involve a determination of the boundary between two states along the remainder of the entire river.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.147" offset="1995943">Another misconception Ohio has of the Indiana v. Kentucky case is based on the language which set the land boundary at Green River Island channel as the low watermark on the Indiana side of the north channel as it existed in 1792.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.806" offset="2062608">However, in the absence of any accretive or erosive change in that channel after Kentucky became a state, and none was suggested, the abandoned channel which existed in 1792 continued to be the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.684" offset="2122062">On the other hand, the Court's principle set forth in Handly's Lessee v. Anthony continued to apply along the remainder of the original channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.804" offset="2162604">The river itself, wherever it may be, continues to be the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.700" offset="2186219">Ohio also misconstrues the Court's language in that case that Kentucky's jurisdiction and dominion continues as they existed when she was admitted into the Union, unaffected by the action of the forces of nature upon the course of the river.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="537.525" offset="2253511">Counsel, you say in Handly's Lessee that the principle is that the river, however it may change, continues to be the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.380" offset="2288933">Now, if it changes by avulsion, as my colleague White said, the river would no longer continue to be the boundary, would it?</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Ringo</label>
            <text syncTime="557.036" offset="2331564">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.098" offset="2339715">This was the point that I was trying to reach at this very moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.121" offset="2355806">It is clear, when they speak of the action of the forces of nature upon the river, the course of the river, in the Indiana v. Kentucky case it was clear from the context of the Court's opinion that this action of the forces of nature upon the course of the river referred to the abandonment of a channel, which would be the island example of an avulsion, and not to a gradual change in the channel which would be accretion and erosion and the boundary would follow that change.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.554" offset="2477537">Nothing in that opinion suggests that the low water mark as it existed in 1792 is of any significance in those areas where the river, wherever it may be -- and the words "wherever it may be" is exactly the words used by Chief Justice Marshall in Handly -- continued to flow in its original channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.433" offset="2561128">Ohio cites absolutely no rule of law which would support its view of Indiana v. Kentucky, and we are aware of none.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.242" offset="2592371">The holdings in Handly and Indiana v. Kentucky each were recognized by the legislatures of Indiana and Kentucky in a 1943 compact approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.585" offset="2641690">The compact connected the terminal points of the 1896 Green River Island survey line of Indiana v. Kentucky to the low water mark constituting the remainder of the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.179" offset="2692054">This acknowledged that the boundary line is the river, wherever it may be at the prevailing low water mark on the northerly edge as set forth in Handly, and that the holding in Indiana v. Kentucky was limited to the fixing of a land boundary along the fill channel north of Green River Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.577" offset="2769690">In addition to all of this, Kentucky has openly maintained for almost 200 years that its boundary extends to the prevailing or current low water mark at its northerly edge.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.730" offset="2814307">Such has been done through its legislative and judicial assertions of sovereignty over the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.009" offset="2835414">This has been expressly recognized not only by previous decisions of this Court but by the courts of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.628" offset="2877837">To adopt Ohio's position would completely ignore the assertion of Virginia to retain the river itself wherever that may be as a natural and living boundary and the United States agreement to accept that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.584" offset="2937710">A 1792 line would be unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.620" offset="2949831">It makes absolutely no sense to make a natural river a boundary and expect it to remain a fixed and beautiful line.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.109" offset="2979819">Thus, no matter from what viewpoint this case is considered, the result indicated is the same - History, legal precedent and common understand all support the continuation of the natural boundary of the river's northerly edge at the prevailing low water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.380" offset="3052857">In the more than thirteen years since this case has been pending, Ohio has been unable to cite to this Court any rule which would warrant adoption of the 1792 low water mark as the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.868" offset="3098833">Therefore, we submit that the decree should be entered providing that the boundary between the state of Ohio and the Commonwealth of Kentucky is the prevailing low water mark on the northerly edge of the Ohio River as it existed at any given time.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.547" offset="3213563">There is only one issue before this Court today and that is whether to adopt the Special Master's report wherein he concludes that the boundary between Ohio and Kentucky is the northerly 1792 low water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.258" offset="3284407">Ohio respectfully submits that the decisions of this Court fully support the recommendation of the Special Master and therefore it should be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.355" offset="3328815">I hope to use my time this morning to make just two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.782" offset="3346474">First, the decision in Indiana v. Kentucky is indeed a fixed boundary decision; and, secondly, there are even policy considerations that are particularly appropriate today which compel this same decision to be followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="827.645" offset="3413974">Mr. Szolosi, are you going sometime during your argument to address the language of Justice Brewer in Ohio v. Nebraska on page 143 of 370 which I am about to quote to you, that not only in respect to the rights of individual landowners but also in respect to the boundary lines between the states, the law of accretion controls?</text>

            <text syncTime="860.386" offset="3544900">Your Honor, we most assuredly agree with that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.543" offset="3565589">And I can direct Your Honor's attention for a moment to page 12 of Kentucky's exceptions, I submit that in Arkansas v. Tennessee, a case cited on page 12 by Kentucky, the general rule is set out, and as characterized by this Court in 1918, it is settled beyond the possibility of dispute that where running streams are the boundaries between states, the same rule applies as between private proprietors, namely that when the bed and channel are changed by the natural and gradual processes known as erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the varying course of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.554" offset="3749595">And I submit, Your Honor, that in Indiana v. Kentucky if indeed, as Kentucky has already conceded, it was a gradual process which caused the channel north of Green River Island to dry up, then Indiana, not Kentucky, would have been determined to rightfully possess Green River Island and then later in the opinion, because of another doctrine, the doctrine of prescription and acquiescence, to have lost it.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.490" offset="3861295">But that isn't what happened in Indiana v. Kentucky.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.341" offset="3872684">Then we are talking about basically a factual situation and that is whether the course of the Ohio River between Ohio and Kentucky changed, if it did change by avulsion or accretion?</text>

            <text syncTime="963.163" offset="3956067">What we are talking about is Indiana v. Kentucky holding that there is a fixed boundary between those states, a fixed boundary as of the date of Kentucky's statehood, 1792.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.026" offset="4003506">Therefore the principles of accretion and avulsion do not apply to the Ohio River, and a Special Master so found.</text>

            <text syncTime="990.848" offset="4066722">It is reconcilable, Your Honor, because this Court in 1890 determined that there was a fixed boundary along the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.425" offset="4109040">It determined it because there are only two constructions that we can give to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.126" offset="4131924">Either it was an avulsion case or it was a fixed boundary case, and I submit it cannot be an avulsion case because the language in Arkansas v. Tennessee sets out a rule long settled and no longer the possibility of dispute that a gradual change in the river, in the channel and bed of the river would be accredited.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.194" offset="4216142">But you can have an avulsion at one point in the river, say, between Ohio and Kentucky, and nonetheless any changes in the river between Ohio and Kentucky as opposed to Indiana and Kentucky could be purely accredit and you could have two different results under Nebraska v.

Iowa was dealing with the middle of the river boundary and unlike the boundary here that is fixed by the cession, a deed and apparently this court in Handly's and in Indiana v. Kentucky construed those matters to have fixed the boundary as of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.591" offset="4389700">The Special Master not only in this case but in the original 81, in a report which is now lodged with the Court but has not as yet officially received, comes to that same conclusion in both matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.890" offset="4438915">That is what I thought your point was, Mr. Szolosi, that while you concede the general applicability of the common law rules of accretion and avulsion with respect to a typical boundary, which is the middle of the river, that this is an atypical boundary depending, as it does, upon the origins of the state of Kentucky and the origins of the Northwest Territory part of which became the state of Ohio, and that with respect to this atypical boundary it is the 1792 line that is the line, quite regardless of any subsequent avulsion or accretion, isn't that your point?</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.388" offset="4620936">Well, that was another atypical boundary between two states, depending on the specific words of some treaties that overrode any ordinary rule about the boundaries between two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.629" offset="4673912">There it was just the middle of the river, rather than the middle of the main channel and based on the word that control where the boundary was originally created, that was the rule, regardless of the general rule about accretion and avulsion and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.182" offset="4736084">But your point is that the words of the grant fixed the boundary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.777" offset="4826467">It was most relevant that the Court inquire into exactly what the status of events was in 1792, and the Court points out in that opinion that if we could just look today we might come to a different result because the water is now all south of the island, but we can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.914" offset="4895013">It is a fixed boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.103" offset="4899819">We have to look to June 1, 1792, and in looking at that date, the date that Kentucky became a state, we have to examine where was that river, and at that time, after examining all of the evidence, they were able to conclude that indeed the waters of the river Ohio did indeed run to the north of that island and therefore, because it is a fixed boundary, the boundary remains there irrespective of whether the boundary has changed by avulsion, by accretion or anything else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.166" offset="5044015">Yes, Your Honor, it most certainly was because of the cession and the interpretation which this Court has placed on what that document did and what boundary it set, whereas in Missouri v. Nebraska or Nebraska v. Iowa the treaties that were involved set the boundary in the middle of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.363" offset="5120815">And obviously when the boundary is in the middle of the river, all of these normal common law rules of erosion and accretion and reliction and avulsion apply, but they don't apply here in our case, and this Court so found in the 1890 decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.962" offset="5335228">But in this case, Your Honor, the practical result is that somewhere in that river there is a 1792 low water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.289" offset="5368560">We've already -- this Court has already noted that the damming of the river, particularly the large dams since 1955, have greatly widened the river and by widening it the 1792 low water mark is somewhere out in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.028" offset="5439509">Clearly, Kentucky would have you believe that that makes it more difficult for the fishermen or for the industry that must discharge water or other substances into the river from determining where they are, are they in Ohio or are they in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.467" offset="5509204">I submit the contrary is true - A fixed boundary is much more convenient and therefore much less subject to cause great amounts of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.257" offset="5552358">For instance -- and let's take the example of industry, a power plant, for example.</text>

            <text syncTime="1672.109" offset="6791816">Your Honor, there is a second policy reason that for consistent I probably should go on and discuss it as well, and that is that in addition to the fact that it is much more convenient and therefore less likely to cause a great amount of litigation to have a fixed boundary, there is a more equitable concern that operates here today and that is with respect to a river like the Ohio that has a low water mark as a boundary and which has been dammed so that the river is now much wider than it was previously, the concepts of avulsion and accretion no longer work, the compensating theory that this Court talked about in Bonelli or Corvallis is no longer at work along the Ohio River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.991" offset="6975300">And so this reason also compels the Court to follow the decisions which it rendered in 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.096" offset="7007796">For instance, normally along any river that has a middle of the river boundary, if there is accretion, the Court has noted, what you can gain on the one hand you might lose on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.389" offset="7060877">And with respect to avulsions, there is really no relevance because it fixes the boundary as of the avulsion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.962" offset="7659186">For instance, again, if I may just direct the Court's attention to pages 21, 20 and 12 of the exceptions filed by Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.109" offset="7699832">First, on page 21, Kentucky sets out the language that we all concede is the most important language in that case as far as determining this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.429" offset="7741106">If when Kentucky became a state, a focus on statehood, not on some date prior to an avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.971" offset="7771303">On the first of June 1792, clearly the date that Kentucky officially became a state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1923.819" offset="7798680">Later in that language, that her jurisdiction extended at that time -- and the Special Master recognized it -- that can only refer to the date of statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.861" offset="7834833">Thus a fixed boundary, not a boundary fixed by avulsion, a fixed boundary, because of the deed and the cession, at that time was the low water mark on the northwest side of the river, and then some very important language in the Indiana v.

            <text syncTime="1983.116" offset="8035871">And the word "any" includes not only avulsion changes but accretion changes, and it goes on to say "or by the fact that the channel in which the river once ran is now filled up from a variety of causes, natural and artificial."</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.818" offset="8094595">Now, I submit, Your Honor, that that language clearly indicates to this Court that in 1890 the Court felt that this was a fixed boundary, but you don't have to rely on my interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.197" offset="8136182">Kentucky tells us as much on two other pages in their exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.446" offset="8153109">On page 20, they try to finesse the issue when they say that the -- they admit first that the river gradually began to change its course so that the main channel flowed to the south of the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.328" offset="8204727">So we have a change in the channel which Kentucky is going to argue was an avulsive change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.603" offset="8229804">And that is what they do, they argue that the change in the Ohio River -- now I am reading on page 20, about half-way down the page -- the change in the Ohio River around the island had been an avulsive change, a change in the bed or main channel of the river itself, and that is how they are going to define avulsion on page 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.770" offset="8298454">But if we look at page 12 of their exceptions, we find out that that is not an avulsive change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.386" offset="8332936">The Court recognized the long settled rule that when the bed -- and I am reading from Arkansas v. Tennessee, the quote on page 12, about the fourth or the fifth or eighth lines -- that when the bed and channel are changed by the natural and gradual processes known as erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the varying course of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.018" offset="8423424">Well, clearly if the Court in Indiana v. Kentucky held or noted in its language that this boundary couldn't be changed by any process, and Kentucky's argument is they were talking about an avulsion, they couldn't have been talking about an avulsion because an avulsion doesn't involve a gradual change, and Kentucky admits it on page 12 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.132" offset="8523943">It involves a sudden change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.255" offset="8532407">In all of the avulsion cases that this Court has decided, there is a date that you can find in the opinions, a date that points out the year in which the avulsion occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.852" offset="8578800">In one case, in Missouri v. Nebraska, 1904, they were able to point to the day, July 5, 1867.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.106" offset="8607848">If Indiana v. Kentucky were an avulsion case, then this Court would have pointed to a day or at least a year in which the avulsion occurred, but they didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.102" offset="8655809">They pointed to the date statehend became official, and that has absolutely no relevance to an avulsion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.640" offset="8685902">So I submit, Your Honor, that even on Kentucky's brief, this Court's interpretation of Indiana -- that the interpretation applied to Indiana v. Kentucky in 1890 is that they found a fixed boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.480" offset="8741282">The only way it could have been an avulsive finding in Indiana v. Kentucky is if the definition of avulsion included a gradual change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.822" offset="8778689">And not only do they cite the case that shows to the contrary, but all of the other avulsion cases point out that it has to be a sudden change and so do all of the treatise writers, and that simply is not the facts in Indiana v. Kentucky.</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Ringo</label>
            <text syncTime="2614.381" offset="10560867">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.524" offset="10577481">The first thing I would like to address is this misunderstanding as to the distinction between the use of the word avulsion and in our reply brief the absence of the word avulsion, and this goes back to the distinction between the general principle of an avulsion, which is a certainly perceptible change that the boundary remains in an abandoned channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.565" offset="10705586">The island rule recognizes the exception to the rule of accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.549" offset="10729618">It has the same result as an avulsion, but it happens very gradually and it is the very same thing that happened in the Missouri v. Kentucky case involving a dispute over Wolf Island which was an island of some 15,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.478" offset="10781236">When Kentucky was admitted to the union, first of all, the boundary between Kentucky and Missouri was the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.787" offset="10814568">When Kentucky was admitted to the union, the main channel ran west of the island and therefore the island was within Kentucky's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.676" offset="10854066">But by the time of the dispute, the main channel of the Mississippi had changed and shifted and ran east of the island and therefore putting at that time Wolf Island on the other side of the main channel, but the Court held that the subsequent change of the channel did not divest Kentucky of its sovereign territory of Wolf Island, and this is the same principle that was applied in Indiana v. Kentucky.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.876" offset="11006830">But that is the reason I discussed Missouri v. Kentucky, because that principle which we are calling the island principle, rather than avulsion because in looking through all the cases of avulsion it always involves a sudden and perceptible change, but this was a result that was the same, so since it wasn't sudden and perceptible it differs from avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.182" offset="11096064">But the reason that we mention Missouri v. Kentucky, that is precisely the principle that the Court relied upon in Indiana v. Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.083" offset="11131695">It states the principles and then cites that principle, whether it is in the middle of the river or the law water mark that is in the Kentucky case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2766.698" offset="11170147">Mr. Ringo, what is your response to this language in the Indiana v. Kentucky case where the court says that if when Kentucky became a state on the first of June 1792, the waters of the Ohio River ran between that tract known as Green River Island and the main body of the state of Indiana, and her right to it falls from the fact that her jurisdiction extended at that time to the low water mark on the northwest side of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.858" offset="11286758">Now, that says the boundary between the state is the low water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.574" offset="11301700">Then it says she succeeded to the ancient right and possession of Virginia and they could not be affected by any subsequent change of the Ohio River or by the fact that the channel in which the river once ran is now filled up from a variety of causes, natural or artificial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.622" offset="11361886">Now, doesn't that just say in plain words that it is the north, it is the low water mark on the north side and that the north low water mark -- the boundary doesn't change by changes in the river?</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.153" offset="11416012">First you must look at the context of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.958" offset="11427192">It was a dispute over Green River Island, that 2,000-acre tract of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.137" offset="11451956">The jurisdiction that were talking about was jurisdiction remaining over that island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.719" offset="11470242">It was not discussing the entire river or the entire state.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2844.041" offset="11479542">Well, the Court goes on and says her dominion and jurisdiction continue as they existed at the time she was admitted to the union, unaffected by the action of the forces of nature upon the course of the river.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_m_ringo" startTime="2857.155" stopTime="3022.514">
            <label>Mr. James M. Ringo</label>
            <text syncTime="2857.155" offset="11531995">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.489" offset="11533354">Now this is the point I tried to make earlier, that it is clear from the context of that portion of the Court's opinion, that this referred to the island rule exception, that they were discussing an abandonment of this northern channel, did not strip or divest Kentucky of this island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.930" offset="11627081">Another important point is that the opinion in Indiana v. Kentucky did not refer to changes in the remainder of the course, it was consistent with the policies of Handly's Lessee v. Anthony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.427" offset="11693119">Going back to an earlier question of the Court, we look to the cession which determined the boundary and how the river was to be perceived as a boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.886" offset="11742960">The cession fixed the river as a natural, ever-changing boundary subject to accretion, and it mentioned in the opinion that the states had the right to it and if there was an accretion to the Indiana side then the accretion would belong to Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.235" offset="11820283">To accept Ohio's position, you fix the 1792 line and locate it wherever it happens to be located, we can assume that this is a natural river and accretions have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.612" offset="11861870">Any accretion that has occurred north of the 1792 low water mark now would not belong to Indiana, Ohio, or Illinois, but would belong to Kentucky, and you would have situations where you would have the River in Kentucky and Ohio or Indiana and it would cause additional problems and this is exactly the reason that Virginia retained the river itself as a natural river, because no matter what the decision of this Court is or the arguments of counsel, the river will continue to go through its natural processes of adjustment which will be through accretion and erosion, and to do anything to the contrary would defeat or defy the terms of Virginia's cession of the national government and the government's exception of that cession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.430" offset="12133125">That is all I have, Your Honor, except I do have -- there are some Eighth Circuit cases concerning this island rule which I did not put in my brief and in fairness to the Court I --</text>
