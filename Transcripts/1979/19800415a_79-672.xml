            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="58.174" offset="336018">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.501" offset="349393">This here -- this case is here on certiorari to the District of Columbia Circuit, which sitting en banc and dividing 5-to-4, denied enforcement of the Board's order against the Union, Local of the Retail Clerks International, which the Board found had engaged in secondary picketing in violation of Section 8 (b) (4) (ii) (B) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.187" offset="476139">This Section makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to threat and coerce or restrain any person for an object of forcing him to cease dealing in the products of or otherwise, to cease dealing of doing business with any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.668" offset="558059">A proviso to this Section accepts publicity other than picketing for the purpose of truthfully advising the public that a product or products are produced by an employer of whom the Union has a primary dispute and are distributed by another employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.043" offset="651577">The question whether the picketing here violates Section 8 (b) (4) (ii) (B) turns on an application of the principles enunciated by this Court in the Tree Fruits decision in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.112" offset="723780">The relevant facts --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="156.565" offset="729631">Well, it -- it turns basically on the statute, doesn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="159.797" offset="742588">And naturally, any cases from this Court interpreting the statute but that the basic criteria is the statutory language.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="169.155" stopTime="731.685">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="169.155" offset="779995">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.045" offset="783548">Except that in Tree Fruits, as I will indicate, the Court did interpret that language as applied to picketing of this general character.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.085" offset="843734">But at bottom, we do get back to an interpretation of the statute and that was what Tree Fruits attempted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.472" offset="873305">The Union here is the certified bargaining representative of certain employees of Safeco Title Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.033" offset="907473">And it called a strike following an impasse in negotiations over an initial contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.453" offset="933177">In addition to picketing Safeco's office, striking employees also engaged in picketing of five land title companies that sell only Safeco Title Insurance policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.127" offset="1003917">The signs carried by the picket stated that Safeco was non-union and did not have a contract with the Union and the handbills, which were distributed at the general public, requested that numbers of the public boycott Safeco Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.506" offset="1073403">The Union's activities at the land title companies did not cause any work stoppages or interference with deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.901" offset="1106944">From 90% to 95% of the income of the land title companies is derived from the issuance of Safeco Title Insurance policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.190" offset="1148113">The remaining 5% to 10% comes from title research and escrow services.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.810" offset="1178624">Each land title company operates under an agency contract with Safeco under which Safeco operate -- underwrites all of its title insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.503" offset="1225435">And the land title company agrees not to act as an agent for any other title insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.260" offset="1256364">Safeco owns stock in all of the land title companies, 53% in one and amounts ranging from 18% to 38% in the other four.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.348" offset="1308714">The remaining stock is held by various individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.521" offset="1329507">An officer of Safeco serves as a member of the board of directors of -- of each land title company and two served on the board of the company in which Safeco owns 53% of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.347" offset="1392724">However, each land title company independently establishes its own wages hours and other terms and conditions of employment for its own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.593" offset="1441729">And there is no interchange of employees between the land title companies and Safeco.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.403" offset="1469001">Based upon these facts, the Board concluded that despite the land title company's economic dependents on -- on Safeco for the underwriting of the title insurance, each land title company retained control over their own labor relations policies and their day to day operations and therefore, they were independent companies and not allied or part of Safeco.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.595" offset="1589791">The Court of Appeals sustained this finding and the Union does not challenge it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.931" offset="1615078">So, for purposes of this case, the land title companies are neutral employers for purposes of second -- Section 8 (b) (4) (B) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.419" offset="1669099">The Board then considered the application of Tree Fruits, whether this Court ruled that Section 8 (b) (4) (ii) (B) permits an -- union to engage in consumer picketing at the site of a secondary employer directed only at the struck product.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.718" offset="1758229">Without laws, a Union appeal with a secondary site which has the effect of causing consumers not to trade at all with the secondary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.177" offset="1804100">And the Board, the two numbers dissenting, concluded that although the Union's secondary site picketing was limited to Safeco's products, the picketing violated 8 (b) (4) (ii) (B) because it was reasonably calculated to induce customers not to patronize neutral title companies at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.795" offset="1906604">Because since virtually all of their business consisted of Safeco Title Insurance, the picketing of successful, would necessarily result in a total boycott of the title companies' business.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.480" offset="1965328">Because of the proviso to 8 (b) (4) (B) which I eluded to earlier, the Union's hand billing was -- of the title companies was neither alleged nor found to be a violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.850" offset="2014751">The only thing that was interdicted was the picket line in front of the title companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.227" offset="2044322">Now, we submit that the Board's application of Tree Fruits is a reasonable application of that -- of the principles articulated in -- in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.964" offset="2107225">The Union in Tree Fruits as the Court will recall, picketed neutral Safeway stores to persuade Safeway's customers to boycott Washington State Apples in support of a dispute that the Union had with the packers and distributors of those apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.787" offset="2186533">Rejecting the Board's ruling that all such secondary picketing was violative of the statute, the Court determined that enacting -- and in enacting Section 8 (b) (4) (BB) -- (ii) (B), the Court had meant to outlaw a peaceful consumer picketing employed to persuade the customers of the secondary employer and quoting from the Court, “To cease trading with them in order to force them to put pressure upon the primary employer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="555.814" offset="2326653">But the Congress did not intend to outlaw picketing which as in this case before it, only persuades the neutral's customers not to buy the struck product.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.128" offset="2375868">The Court explained that when consumer picketing is employed only to persuade, customer is not to buy the struck product, the Union's appeal is closely confined to the primary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.213" offset="2436263">But on the other hand, when consumer of picketing is employed to persuade, customer is not to trade at all, but the secondary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.055" offset="2479626">The Union does more than merely follow the struck product.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.764" offset="2494464">It creates a separate dispute with the secondary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.638" offset="2513899">Now, the fact of Tree Fruits, permitted a clear distinction between picketing limited to persuading customer is not to buy this struck product and picketing aimed at the secondary's patronage generally, because apples occupied, but a small portion of Safeway's retail shelves and the Union could urge Safeway's customers from refrain from buying the apples without asking that they cease trading with Safeway altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.951" offset="2663215">Here, such a sharp distinction cannot be made, because although the picketing is directed at the struck product, that product constitutes virtually all of the neutral's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.735" offset="2730297">And in these circumstances, the picketing necessarily is successful with result in a boycott of the neutral's total business.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.730" offset="2766242">And in that kind of situation, one interest must yield.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.885" offset="2790902">Either the Union's interest in maximizing pressure on the primary, or the neutral's interest in avoiding a boycott of its total business, and we submit that in the light of the legislative history of the 1959 amendments of the Act, which has set forth at length in the various opinions and in -- in Tree Fruits, this history which shows a desire on the part of Congress to protect neutral employers from secondary picketing at least, where it called for a boycott of the neutral's total business, the Board was not unreasonable in striking the balance here in favor of the neutral employer.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="743.780" offset="3078457">The fact is they were owned -- or partially owned by the producer of the boycotted product, weren't they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="750.086" stopTime="821.641">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="750.086" offset="3103744">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.904" offset="3106983">But it -- under the established principles that are applied with respect to determining neutrality, you'll look at a -- a number of factors, the degree of common ownership and control, the degree of economic interdependence and also, the degree of control over labor relations in the day to day operations of the -- of the entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.622" offset="3249821">The Board found that looking at a -- all of these factors, they predominated the -- in favor of the finding of -- of neutrality, because although there was some common ownership and some representation of sharing of directors, in terms of the actual control over the labor relations, Safeco had no control over that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="844.822" offset="3482624">Yes, it found that despite the -- the fact that there was more ownership in that case, there was still no showing that there was any -- that that additional amount of stock ownership had resulted in any greater interference or control by Safeco over the labor relations policies of the land title companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.058" offset="3571649">And therefore, in terms of the finding of neutrality, there was no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.047" offset="3595577">Because the essence of what makes a neutral for 8 (b) (4) (B) purposes, is whether or not, the neutral is powerless to resolve the underlying dispute with the primary other than by ceasing to do business with the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.274" offset="3660466">And the Board found and the Court of Appeals sustained its finding, that that was the situation of the land title companies here even the one with the 53% --</text>

            <text syncTime="927.428" offset="3813125">Our second point is that if the Board's interpretation of the statute as applying to -- as interdicting this type, picketing is upheld, we do not believe that as the Union urges, that a substantial constitutional problem is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.304" offset="3956590">The Union has devoted a substantial portion of its brief to this contention, but we believe that the constitutional phase of this case was settled by this Court many years ago in Hughes against Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.609" offset="4061811">And in which principles have been followed as recently as several months ago in Babbitt against Farmers Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.401" offset="4128998">The nub of the point is that it's -- as we read the cases, it is settled law that picketing is a mode of communication that is inseparably -- that while picketing is a mode of communication, it's inseparably something more indifferent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.023" offset="4247489">It's more than free speech, since it involves patrol of a particular locality and since the very presence of a picket line, may induce action of one kind or another quite different from the nature of the ideas which are being disseminated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.607" offset="4681749">It's argued here that the objective sought by this picketing is not unlawful in that sense because there is nothing unlawful for a consumer to boycott a -- a title company or a retail store for reasons of his own, nor by virtue of the publicity proviso to 8 (b) (4) would've be unlawful for a union by publicity, other than picketing to seek to induce such a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.579" offset="4833677">We submit however though, that Hughes shows that you don't have to have an objective that is unlawful in that sense for a state or the Federal Government to restrict its attainment by a form of coercion such as is represented by secondary picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.494" offset="5041298">In the Langer case, the Court sustained the constitutionality of the ban on picketing that (i) (B) imposed against peaceful picketing that induced employees, secondary employees to strike in furtherance of a secondary boycott objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="1299.216" offset="5300224">Similarly, we submit that Congress could likewise proscribe secondary consumer picketing at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.411" offset="5357066">Whereas here, it calls for a total boycott of the neutral's business in furtherance of its objective of freeing neutrals from these pressures and indeed, in the Farm Workers against Babbitt case, in which this Court -- to be sure was interpreting or was considering a state statute, the Arizona farm labor statute and they had a publicity proviso there and the question was whether that was unconstitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.527" offset="5509517">The Court in setting aside the lower court's holding of unconstitutionality indicated that publicity stood on a different footing than picketing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2718.190" offset="10976110">We believe quite clearly that the Board hasn't fulfilled that most central function to an orderly system of -- of federal statutory interpretation and elaboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.728" offset="11046327">As I say, my first reason, our first reason for that is the fact that the Board has given no reference to the context in which the critical phrases were used in the opinion and has ignored absolutely the example we set out from the Court's opinion in -- on page 17 of our brief, which we think makes its intent absolutely lucid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.240" offset="11160325">In addition, I would like to point out on this portion of the case that the Board has indeed adopted the very theory of the Tree Fruits, Court of Appeals rejected in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.084" offset="11231692">The Court of Appeals in that case said that the Board was wrong, but said also that the case should be remanded to determine economic impact, possible economic impact on Safeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.918" offset="11315075">The heart of the Board's theory here in its leading case is that Tree Fruits rest on the minimal impact of the picketing on Safeway as compared to the predictable economic effect of the picketing here which would cause the agencies to abandon the primary, in favor of a new source of supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.535" offset="11425520">That is precisely the test we would suggest, that was rejected in Tree Fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.430" offset="11453106">I would -- I have 10 minutes left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.855" offset="11466794">I would like to discuss both of the constitutional arguments that we make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.614" offset="11493857">Interestingly enough, Justice Black concurred in Tree Fruits on the ground not of statutory interpretation, but that and I'm quoting from his opinion as set out at page 33 of our brief, “While others are left free to picket for other reasons, those who wished to picket to inform Safeway customers of their labor dispute with the primary employer are barred from picketing, solely on the ground of the lawful information they want to impart to the customers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.225" offset="11648293">The -- the Court of course eventually in Mosley and then Erznoznik the Chief Justice's opinion in City of Madison has adopted Justice Black's view of the special consideration that has to be given to an antidiscrimination principle in the First Amendment area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.073" offset="11783711">You distinguished the Hughes case in your brief by quoting at some length from Professor Cox's article.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.490" offset="11813282">And he in turn draws a distinction between picketing back by the threat of economic sanctions and picketing which appeals only the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.242" offset="11852361">In this case, I guess there were no -- there was no interference with delivery involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.641" offset="11869915">Now, had you had a situation in which -- although your message was precisely the same, the teamsters cut off delivery because they have crossed the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.702" offset="11902203">Would that be a different case or would it be the same case?</text>

            <text syncTime="2953.887" offset="11918921">In other words, I don't believe that Congress in regulating signals to organized employees not to engage -- excuse me, signals to organized employees to engage in a concerted work stoppage need adopt an intent as opposed to an effects test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.449" offset="12013171">But, we do argue that labor unions or any other organization in this society unions have one out of every four working people in their ranks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.595" offset="12073775">There are many who aren't even organizable, who have no control over the individuals they're appealing to, can carry a placard which is the essence of picketing, asking members of the general public to do something they have a right to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.397" offset="12212955">Would they be equally lawful or whether legality turn on -- on and whether there were economic -- adverse economic consequence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.022" offset="12295502">And (2), on whether the message can be fairly whereas addressed to create a consumer -- I mean, to create a concerted work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.892" offset="12354957">I'm not saying that we -- we will never be here arguing that it is so unfair to read it, if we won this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.549" offset="12381602">That it's so unfair to read our sign as directed to employees that we went up and we pleaded with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.268" offset="12408456">Let's take that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.619" offset="12413889">Suppose there's a case where the Union officials go up and plead and the district judge finds in good faith with the employees not to engage in a concerted work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.732" offset="12466343">And nonetheless, the picketing is enjoined on a pure effect test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.415" offset="12481076">I think that's a difficult constitutional case if it's -- if that effect is used to ban all communication to everybody in the area of both -- on many steps from having a luxury of arguing that case to you or Mr. Come argues that we can't even appeal to consumers, if we don't cause a single illegal consequence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3120.469" offset="12585253">Well, but, it seem to me that the Cox's distinction didn't turn on the legality of the economic sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.862" offset="12606777">I think, if I understood him correctly, he was suggesting that picketing would be unprotected if it had this economic consequences even though it were perfectly lawful for the -- say, the teamsters to cut off deliveries because they don't want to cut.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.315" offset="12684622">His -- he -- that portion of his article is arguing against equating, picketing for -- picketing address to consumers was so-called signal picketing addressed to -- to workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.138" offset="12755884">In other portions of his article, he questions cases like Henke and Gazzam and so on which we discussed in our brief, which seem to relax the Giboney standard and which suggest that picketing can be banned even though it causes no unlawful end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.793" offset="12838536">But only an end in a very strange sense which is against public policy even though the public policy doesn't ban the conduct which takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.683" offset="12890154">That would be like saying that you can ban leafleting, asking people to do something lawful because you disagree with the ultimate social utility of the message.</text>

            <text syncTime="3239.825" offset="13062666">And at that point, the supposition was that California could ban affirmative action and the California opinions can be read as either banning it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.153" offset="13111986">Justice Frankfurter says two different things in two different passages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.544" offset="13125569">We do believe for five separate reasons that Hughes has been passed by, that its analysis is unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.023" offset="13175515">We think first of all that without acknowledging it, it expands Giboney to change the requirement from an unlawful object to one which is against public policy in this very unusual use of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.113" offset="13255868">That secondly, Hughes rest on a proposition that speech which is not an appeal to reason can be banned of a view which is absolutely incompatible, we would suggest, with cases such as Cone and Spence versus Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.546" offset="13341550">Next, Hughes rest on the premise which we think is absolutely contrary to the test stated in United States versus O'Brien that picketing can be banned because it involves conduct and without regard to whether the ban is absolutely necessary to prevent wrongful conduct and doesn't cut into express of speech anymore than is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.367" offset="13484805">And I want to say something at this point about the meaning of picketing and the meaning of compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.081" offset="13523675">Mr. Justice Marshall in its opinion in -- in the Mosley case noted that picketing can be an act by a single person walking back and forth with a placard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.775" offset="13574457">Now, there can be statements and opinions and statements by the Board that that is inherently compulsive in the sense that it would frighten away somebody from crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.517" offset="13613432">But we don't think that there is an iota of reality to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.128" offset="13627852">That is no more threatening than going up to someone and asking him if they'll sign a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.245" offset="13656377">It's no more threatening than going up and asking him if he will take a leaflet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.642" offset="13681977">We ask you to look at the record in Number 88, 1964 term, “Tree Fruits” at the two rather dignified ladies picketing in Tree Fruits and we ask you if it is fair to say that they were engaged in compulsive activity.</text>
