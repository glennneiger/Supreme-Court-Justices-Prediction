            <text syncTime="85.569" offset="447676">This matter is before the Court this morning on a petition for certiorari directed to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.401" offset="475052">The respondent in this case, Thomas Innis, was found guilty of kidnapping, robbery and murder by a Superior Court, sitting with a jury, on November 12th, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.778" offset="520505">During that trial, the Superior Court had denied a motion to suppress a shotgun that had been seized under the circumstances that give rise to this petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.701" offset="564182">The case began on midnight, or shortly after midnight, of January 16th, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.326" offset="602739">A cab driver named Aubin complained to the Providence Police Department that he'd been assaulted by a man carrying a sawed off shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.808" offset="640669">While he was in the police department giving a statement, he observed a photograph of the respondent, Thomas Innis, on a bulletin board in the police department, and spontaneously identified his assailant as Thomas Innis.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.521" offset="691555">The police put out a bulletin for a search in the area of the city of Providence where the cab driver had dropped Innis off, the Mt. Pleasant area.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.418" offset="727082">At about 4:30 in the morning, a patrol officer on Chalkstone Avenue in the city of Providence saw Innis on a sidewalk and apprehended him, handcuffed him, and gave him his Miranda warning.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis J. Roberts, II</label>
            <text syncTime="170.285" offset="786536">A cab driver had been shot and killed, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.791" offset="796568">The case which is before the Court this morning involves the shooting and killing of that cab driver, who at that time had not yet--the body had not yet been discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.495" offset="843379">The first patrol officer gave Innis his Miranda warnings for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.682" offset="864172">Within a few minutes after that, a Sergeant arrived and gave Miranda--gave Miranda warnings for the second time to Innis.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.503" offset="895415">Within two or three minutes after that, the commanding--the night commander of the Providence Police Department at that time, Captain Leyden, arrived on the scene and gave Innis his Miranda warnings for the third time.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.904" offset="945048">At that time, Innis asserted his right to have counsel, at which point Captain Leyden directed that all interrogation cease, that he be placed in a caged police car with three police officers, and taken to the central police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.051" offset="1005652">This was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.130" offset="1009936">He was also specifically advised, I should point out, that the--the suspect not be interrogated on the way to the police station, and that there be no conversation, no questioning, directed to him.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis J. Roberts, II</label>
            <text syncTime="243.280" offset="1078585">-- and one in the cage with Thomas Innis.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.270" offset="1090497">Along the way -- they had gone approximately two minutes, and traveled approximately one-half mile to a mile--at that point the police officer on the passenger side of the front seat said to the police officer in the driver's seat, it would be a shame--and I'm giving the substance of what he said now; I'm not attempting to quote--it would be a shame if one of the retarded children who goes to the school for the handicapped in this neighborhood should find that gun and hurt himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.708" offset="1204287">At that point, Thomas Innis, to whom this had not been directed as an interrogatory, volunteered - Okay, take me back to the scene; I'm going to show you where the gun is.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.116" offset="1249844">Thomas Innis was taken back to the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.707" offset="1260293">Captain Leyden who was still there, removed him from the back seat of the caged vehicle, and gave him for the fourth time his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.854" offset="1300835">At that point, Thomas Innis said no, I would like to show you where the gun is.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.874" offset="1316927">I'm concerned that some of the handicapped children at the school for the retarded in this neighborhood might get hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.921" offset="1341064">Thereupon, he took the police officers into a field, and after a little bit of looking for it, they located the sawed off shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.035" offset="1369590">He was subsequently charged with the murder of John Mulvaney, the cab driver who had been missing at this point for three or four days.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.869" offset="1400936">He was found guilty of kidnapping, robbery and murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.726" offset="1424342">The sole issue before the Court this morning is the question of suppression of the shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.808" offset="1448688">Now, in a 3-2 opinion, which reversed the conviction of the trial court, the majority of the Rhode Island Supreme Court relied heavily on the Brewer case, Brewer v. Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.747" offset="1524443">Now, Brewer of course specifically failed to consider the Miranda doctrine, or the voluntariness of Williams' statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.111" offset="1553910">Miranda played no part in Brewer, which strictly was a Sixth Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.521" offset="1575539">And as the Court pointed out in Brewer, the key to invocation of Sixth Amendment rights must be, the commencement of some kind of judicial proceedings, as clearly existed in Brewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.248" offset="1622455">He, of course, had been arrested; he had been arraigned, he was represented by two counsel; he was charged; he was on his way back to Des Moines for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.144" offset="1654011">None of that is applicable in Innis.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.357" offset="2190879">He had been a patrol officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.520" offset="2195477">He was not, as Captain Leeming was in Brewer for example, a skilled interrogator.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.316" offset="2218674">The duration of the trip was, I think they said, two or three minutes, and a half-mile to one mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.371" offset="2254932">There was apparently an off-handed remark made by one officer to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.134" offset="2269978">There was no attempt here by a skilled interrogator to go after a known psychological weakness, if you will, of a man who was known to be an escaped mental patient and a religious fanatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.105" offset="2317834">All of the elements that applied to lead to the conclusion that there was undoubtedly an interrogation in Brewer do not apply in Innis.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.147" offset="2353988">So it seems to me that in the Rhode Island Supreme Court's reliance, the majority's reliance, on Brewer, they're both doctrinally and factually way off base.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.230" offset="2394321">And it seems to me that on that grounds alone, the decision of the majority in the Rhode Island Supreme Court cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.070" offset="2433714">When you get into Miranda questions, the accepted standards of Miranda, the State submits, could lead to the mandate of a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.904" offset="2488989">Because we don't have interrogation; we do have a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.727" offset="2504349">And further, the application of a per se exclusionary rule, the extension of Wong Sun to the Miranda procedural safeguards under the Fifth Amendment, simply is not justified by the teachings of this Court, and is not justified by principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.692" offset="2584179">As we go through the steps, everything that could be found to support the respondent's position, and support the views of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.424" offset="2627124">If there were interrogation, there would be a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.284" offset="2634543">If there were an interrogation and there were no waiver, the exclusionary rule should not be automatically applied in this case, because the exclusionary rule should turn on the totality of circumstances in the case and the reliability of the evidence, and not upon a mere per se extension of Wong Sun, Fifth Amendment, and beyond Fifth Amendment, into the exclusionary--into the prophylactic safeguards of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.714" offset="2740287">So under all of these Miranda-type tests, the Supreme Court decision below cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.002" offset="2769439">There is another interesting alternative, which is proposed, by Professor Granno--Professor Granno, in a criminal law review article, this past summer's issue of the Criminal Law Review, 17 American Criminal Law Review page 1, He discusses what he refers to there as the rationale approach to Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.610" offset="2871839">He distinguishes that from what I've been discussing during the last few minutes, that is, the black letter approach, he called, to Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.692" offset="2900156">The rationale approach, as I read it, is essentially a voluntariness test of Miranda.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.277" offset="4378478">But as I believe Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out a few moments ago, if there is no interrogation here, if the statements by patrolman A to patrolman B, "I hope none of the children at the school for the handicapped are injured," if that doesn't constitute improper custodial interrogation, then the respondent's whole position is lost.</text>

            <text syncTime="1909.247" offset="7742422">This case raises questions regarding the legal effect of a request for counsel made by a suspect in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.976" offset="7773351">Given the fact of this request, it also raises questions regarding the effect of what the respondent would term an emotionally evocative conversation which followed immediately upon the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.593" offset="7823820">Finally, it raises questions regarding the admissibility of tangible evidence that was seized as a result of admissions evoked from Innis in the police wagon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.521" offset="7871467">Respondent contends that once he had unambiguously asked for an attorney, the police violated the Miranda mandate when they exerted further pressure on him to incriminate himself, even though this pressure did not take the form of a direct statement or a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.047" offset="7937609">As this pressure resulted in an incriminating statement, the violation could not be cured by an immediate subsequent rendition of the Miranda warnings, and a repetition of the inculpatory statement made previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.568" offset="7995705">Finally, the respondent would argue that where the police from the very first were seeking an item of tangible evidence, and they succeeded in locating it only by frustrating his exercise of his right to counsel, the tangible evidence, as well as the earlier admissions, should be suppressed from evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.461" offset="8075222">The Attorney General for the State of Rhode Island has outlined the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.417" offset="8103121">I would--I would simply like to illuminate several of those facts and perhaps mention a few that were overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.146" offset="8138021">First of all, it would appear clear from the record that Thomas Innis realized that the police officers were looking for the shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.385" offset="8170935">At the time he received his second set of warnings, police officers were already searching the area for the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.567" offset="8203640">And at that point, Innis was apparently out of the patrol car that he had originally been placed in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.138" offset="8226001">Secondly, there's some indication in the record through testimony by Officer Gleckman that he was instructed by his Captain not to interrogate or coerce Innis in any way en route to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.351" offset="8286814">There's no indication in the record that Innis, in fact, could hear what might be termed these reassuring instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.980" offset="8313354">In fact, the evidence indicates that at that time he was in fact inside the wagon with the closed--with the doors closed, and that he could not hear those instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.090" offset="8357763">Also, the State has raised the point that Officer Gleckman was what I think the dissent in Innis termed a street cop, and therefore, putting it somewhat bluntly, that he wasn't smart enough to come up with this kind of a ploy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.101" offset="8417844">I frankly can't presume that a street officer doesn't have the creativity, even in the brief time allotted to him, to produce the kind of statements that he produced here, and moreover to produce them with an intent to gain information regarding an item of tangible evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.450" offset="8507183">Finally, I think it is crucial to note in this case, and perhaps most crucial, that the record here does not purport to contain anything more than a synopsis of whatever happened in that police car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.711" offset="8560264">The police officers, when they took the stand in the mini-suppression hearing that was held in this case, simply were not asked precisely what they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.051" offset="8597671">They simply summarized, in a sentence or two, the general tenor of their conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.847" offset="8620763">The most we have are a few details, and those details, I would suggest, are purely emotionally evocative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.768" offset="8656499">Officer Gleckman apparently talked in terms of, "Gee, it would be too bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.465" offset="8675307">Perhaps some one--a little girl, perhaps--would kill herself."</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.861" offset="8688891">Not merely injure herself, but kill herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.558" offset="8699653">And a second officer provided what one might cynically term counterpoint to that saying, "Gee, that really is too bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.835" offset="8736747">We really need to find the gun."</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.104" offset="8749808">I'm not trying to suggest that the record in this case evokes visions of thumb screws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.714" offset="9868267">But I think the point that should be drawn from your hypothetical is, in the situations where, in general, it is unlikely that the police or other law enforcement agencies are seeking to gain incriminating information, it is highly questionable as to whether Miranda applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.109" offset="9941828">I mean, I think in effect the Court has said much [ILLEGIBLE WORDS] pronounce the rule that the Court--that society has a right to everyone's evidence; and they operate, and they say that the prosecution may operate on the presumption, when a witness goes before a grand jury, that that witness first of all will not be incriminating himself, and secondly, that the prosecutor in fact is not trying to incriminate that witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.892" offset="10060946">And that is the major reason for holding that they need not be given Miranda warnings, at least in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.046" offset="10085606">So where you're talking about simple administrative processing, absent some showing that it in fact was some kind of a ploy to gain incriminating information, I think a strong argument could be mounted that that would not constitute interrogation within the meaning of Miranda, even though in fact in that case questions were asked of the suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.129" offset="10201903">I think that, in regard to--the Attorney General has also mentioned here that the span of time is a very short one, indicating that somehow this means that the pressures on Innis were less.</text>

            <text syncTime="3162.530" offset="12755529">We suggest that absent an actual admission of intent by the police, the standard must be an objective one that it's rarely easy--subjective intent is rarely an easy issue, and that the motivations of officers are usually complex, they're many faceted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.554" offset="12835673">And in fact, an officer testifying a year later might well not even know precisely why he uttered the comments he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.890" offset="12869005">I would merely, and requestfully, suggest the trial court shouldn't be required to guess whether a police officer's motivation, or his testimony as to those motivations, are accurate or merely convenient.</text>

            <text syncTime="3510.018" offset="14145452">In this instance, the record makes abundantly clear that Captain Leyden scrupulously honored the suspect's rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3683.969" offset="14841250">Just a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.910" offset="14853057">Essentially, my brother's argument rests in whole on the fact that Miranda precludes interrogation under stressful conditions, which he reads that of course, it seems to me, to be any observation made after the time of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.808" offset="14912616">In other words, after the man has been in custody and once asserted his Miranda rights, it seems to me the argument is coming that he cannot thereafter waive those rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3737.596" offset="15055768">I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be understood to say that that was not precluded by Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.924" offset="15069142">What I'm saying is, that where there's custody, and we have this whole idea of inherent compulsion which precludes waiver, that's a--that that was never precluded by Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.913" offset="15117103">And when we do talk about the scrupulous observance of constitutional rights in this particular case, we do have to remember that the man was taken back to the scene, was taken out of the car in which he was sitting with the three officers, was spoken to again by Captain Leyden, and told Captain Leyden, "No, I want to take you to the gun because I don't want the children to be hurt."</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.070" offset="15189723">And then immediately he took them to the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.083" offset="15197769">That's the second waiver away from whatever offense may have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.586" offset="15211771">So it seems to me that that's overlooked, and not given sufficient attention by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.098" offset="15233818">Two transcript references, if I may, and it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.422" offset="15251059">There was reference made in my brother's argument to the fact that there wasn't any testimony concerning what was really said in the police car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.355" offset="15282824">In fact, the opinion--I should say the Appendix, at pages 43 through 45 contains what was said in the police car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.209" offset="15330262">Granted, it's not much, but that's all there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.331" offset="15338726">Once the--that's one of the State's positions, that if this little bit of observation, byplay, in the front seat of the automobile constitutes impermissible interrogation, it's taken Miranda way beyond its original facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.680" offset="15408107">The second point made by my brother is, the Rhode Island Supreme Court really didn't rely on the Brewer case in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.317" offset="15438723">At page 6A of the opinion of the court, in the petition for writ of certiorari, the basis of the Rhode Island Supreme Court's distinction is set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.166" offset="15470070">And I submit that any fair and reasonable reading of that basis of the opinion is to rest that court's decision on this court's holding in Brewer v. Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.689" offset="15516150">What we're dealing with here, may it please the Court, is a situation where the respondent, it seems to me, respectfully, is attempting to extend the prophylactic safeguards of Miranda into a situation where it violates what members of this Court have referred to over the years as the strong public interest in convicting the guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.814" offset="15584695">And it's respectfully submitted that the Court should not permit that result; that the decision of the Rhode Island Supreme Court should be reversed.</text>
