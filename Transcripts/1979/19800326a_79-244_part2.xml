            <text syncTime="19.716" offset="182209">Before the luncheon recess, I was addressing myself to the cases of Rakas, Simmons and Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.322" offset="216691">I submit most respectfully that those three cases do not undercut Jones v. United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="67.156" offset="371963">The footnote in the opinion reserved decision on that because of the different array of decisions in the federal circuits concerning the viability of Jones.</text>

            <text syncTime="86.934" offset="451062">I agree wholeheartedly, Your Honor, but the point that has not been raised or has been raised but not directly answered by my brother is the issue of the prosecutorial self-contradiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.719" offset="514278">In this particular case, the government would seem to have the best of both worlds.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.948" offset="539146">At one point in time, they are saying that defendant Zackular does not have standing to attack the validity of the search because he was not in possession or had no reasonable expectation of privacy at his mother's house; and on the other hand they are saying -- and contradictory, just as Justice Frankfurter had pointed out in Jones, that on the other hand he clearly had possession enough to find him guilty before a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.368" offset="668818">Well, what is your answer to Justice White's question to your colleague that the defendant is also talking out of both sides of his mouth when he asserts possession for purposes of a suppression motion, whether it be the substantive Fourth Amendment issue or standing query, and then enters a plea of not guilty, which means a general denial to all of the allegations?</text>

            <label>Mr. John C. McBride</label>
            <text syncTime="167.934" offset="775084">The answer to your question is the defendant, especially my defendant, Mr. Zackular, did not testify at the motion to suppress hearing because I felt at the time, in reliance upon Jones, that we had automatic standing to assert a violation of our rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.066" offset="835688">I did not want Mr. Zackular to make a statement at the motion to suppress hearing, full well knowing that under a Simmons context it couldn't be used against him substantively on the issue of guilt or innocence but in light of Jones we were constricted at that time by a search pursuant to a warrant that was governed by the four corners of the affidavit in the search warrant at that time, and in light of Jones I felt strongly that my client should absolutely exercise his right to remain silent and not say anything because he was given the benefit of the automatic standing rule enunciated by Judge Frankfurter in Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.843" offset="974764">In terms of speaking out of both sides of his mouth, if you advocate the prosecutor's position, in answer to your question, Your Honor, then the prosecutor would have my client get on the witness stand and testify yes, I lived with my mother, or yes I had some type of proprietary or possessory interest in the house in Melrose where the checks were found.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.231" offset="1068283">Clearly, if he testified at trial, he has to testify consistently with this.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.447" offset="1117184">Simply by pleading not guilty, he puts in issue, that is he denies the allegation of possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.835" offset="1250722">What it does is it allows the defendant to remain silent and it allows the defendant to assert a violation of a Fourth Amendment right by remaining silent and gaining the benefit of Jones and the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1451.277" offset="5908459">Well, wouldn't that have been the critical fact as in Rakas the passenger did not have standing, but if he had been a part owner of the car, presumably he would have had standing so therefore doesn't that make ownership the critical test under the Rakas approach on which you seem to rely?</text>

            <text syncTime="1467.590" offset="5973765">But in any event, Rakas was concerned only with the property interest in the area that was searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.337" offset="5988707">I think that is an entirely different question than a property interest in the item seized as a basis for suppressing the evidence obtained during the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.242" offset="6024338">In answer to your question before, Mr. Justice Stevens, there is only one case of which I am aware, United States v. Mazzelli, from the Ninth Circuit, that deals with the question of a possessory interest in the item seized as a sufficient basis for challenging -- that holds that a possessory interest in the item seized is a sufficient basis for challenging the search.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.924" offset="6107094">There are many cases that deal with it, including your opinion in United States v. Lisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.310" offset="6124648">Mazzelli is the only one of which I am aware that goes the other way, and that is presently pending before the Court on our petition for certiorari under the name of Conway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.854" offset="6158817">Other than that, I am not aware of any cases that have so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.675" offset="6174072">We would also like to emphasize that the arguments that we present in our reply brief are applicable not only to the automatic standing issue that is presented in this case but are also fully applicable in cases where the defendant claims actual standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.325" offset="6228720">In particular, we believe that the defendant in Rawlings v. Kentucky, which is to be argued in tandem with the instant case today, does not have actual standing simply because his property interest in the items that were seized from his companion's purse, that basis by itself in our view does not suffice to establish his Fourth Amendment standing for the reasons set forth in our reply brief.</text>
