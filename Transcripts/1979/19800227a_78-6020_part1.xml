            <text syncTime="44.628" offset="281893">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.465" offset="297253">Petitioner Anthony LaRocca was convicted and sentenced consecutively under the enhanced penalty provisions of two federal statutes for the identical use of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.935" offset="347094">Two counts alleged that he had assaulted federal officers with a pistol in violation of Section 111 of Title XVIII, while another count charged that he used the same pistol to commit these same felonies in violation of Section 924 (c) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="80.677" offset="426088">Petitioner challenges the Section 924 (c) conviction and sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.170" offset="452002">In punishing assaults on federal officers, Section 111 has long provided an augmented penalty if a firearm is used to accomplish the assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.520" offset="501426">The issue presented here is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.358" offset="512815">When Congress adopted Section 924 (c) in 1968 to provide an enhanced penalty generally for the use of a firearm in the commission of a federal felony, did it intend to duplicate the coverage of Section 111?</text>
            <text syncTime="120.364" offset="584808">Frankly, it's surprising that it's necessary to bring this issue to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.286" offset="604557">Indeed, adopting petitioner's construction of the statute, the Justice Department in 1971 advised all U.S. attorneys not to prosecute defendants under Section 924 (c) where one of the pre-existing enhanced penalty statutes already applied.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="149.407" offset="701001">I believe the department was acting on the basis of the very principles of interpretation that guided this Court to come to the same exact conclusion in Simpson against the United States, in particular, the rule on specificity that calls for a more specific criminal statute to govern to the exclusion of a more general statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.611" offset="789817">And in addition, in the following year 1972, in a letter to the U.S. Attorney for Baltimore, the department again reiterated the same position and also said, “We adopt the statement of Representative Poff as government policy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="189.262" offset="860453">Representative Poff's statement was precisely on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.620" offset="877902">He said his -- his proposal was not intended to apply to the preexisting statutes in as much as they already serve to deter the use of firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.983" offset="935267">Now, the Government of course could change its views on a question like this, but not in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.707" offset="1050206">Mr. Busic was charged under Section 924 (c) (2).</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="257.622" offset="1133902">Well, our position, it suffices for our case merely to call attention to the overlap between the preexisting statutes in Section 924 (c) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="268.466" offset="1177266">Our position is that Simpson and the tools of construction relied on there vitiate a conviction under 924 (c) (1) quite clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.800" offset="1218539">There is then a separate question whether Simpson and the principles on which it relies also vitiate a conviction under Section 924 (c) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="289.651" offset="1262007">The Court could conclude in the negative with respect to that question that that would in no way diminish the force of Mr. LaRocca's petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.346" offset="1304743">Why do you suppose Congress would deliberately select a lesser enhancement for a -- a felony described in 111 than in other felonies?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="314.233" offset="1360332">Well, our position is that the preexisting enhanced penalty statutes establish an array of punishments, some more some less than Section 924 (c) and that in enacting 924 (c), Congress chose not to deal with how to reconcile these -- these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.070" offset="1443610">Congress chose rather to extend coverage to felonies that were not already subject to an augmented penalty if a firearm is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.786" offset="1482480">That's precisely what Representative Poff stated and furthermore --</text>

            <text syncTime="359.906" offset="1542980">I think his -- his statement is subject to that interpretation, but at a minimum, he must have meant that if for instance Section 111 applies, then his proposal was not intended to duplicate that coverage.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.171" offset="1628035">That would be the real minimum.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.261" offset="1736391">One could read his state -- but the precise words he used were as follows, "My proposal is not intended to apply to Sections 111, 112, 113 of Title XVIII which already define the penalties for the use of a firearm.”</text>
            <text syncTime="426.983" offset="1811310">In our case, it precisely involves the use of a firearm, not to carrying but the use.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.945" offset="1839104">Furthermore, this statement is entitled, I believe, to great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.599" offset="1853733">It was expressly made for the sake of legislative history at the time the amendment was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.911" offset="1887065">Furthermore, it went uncontradicted except for Senator Dominick whose own amendment failed at enactment, no one suggested a different interaction to govern among these provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="494.155" offset="2079953">Well, there's no question that there is ambiguity in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.120" offset="2099806">That has to be the necessary conclusion from this Court's decision in Simpson.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.123" offset="2119868">At the very least, the parties are -- agree that Simpson holds that 924 (c) does not apply to a violation of an enhancement provision as in the bank robbery statute or as in Section 111.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.323" offset="2180681">To that extent, it's agreed that 924 (c) has exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.011" offset="2203460">That is established by Simpson.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.910" offset="2223000">Now, what seems very convincing to us is that the Justice Department itself when it first analyzed this statute, focused exactly on Representative Poff's statement and said, “We adopt this as official policy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="545.790" offset="2286529">At the very, very least, that must indicate an ambiguity in this situation that under the rule of lenity it must be resolved in the defendant's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.320" offset="2332609">That's not all that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.043" offset="2339506">We also have the principle that calls for a more specific criminal statute to govern where two statutes addressed the same concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.786" offset="2386526">The Court has already analyzed these various considerations and weighed them carefully and come to a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.306" offset="2420590">It did that in Simpson against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.590" offset="2437726">In Simpson, the petitioners attacked sentences under the enhancement provisions of both the bank robbery statute and Section 924 (c), but contrary to the suggestion that the Government is trying to make that Simpson merely forbids double enhancement, the petitioners there weren't arguing simply against double enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.169" offset="2532080">They maintained instead that 924 (c) does not apply at all where its purpose is already served by a preexisting statute that it -- that is designed to deter the use of firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.453" offset="2581191">Accordingly, those petitioners asked to have their Section 924 (c) convictions vacated even though the heaviest sentences they received had been imposed under the enhancement paragraph of the bank robbery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.131" offset="2639914">And the Court responded by concluding, "Congress cannot be said to have authorized the imposition of the additional penalty of Section 924 (c) for commission of bank robbery with firearms already subject to enhanced punishment."</text>
            <text syncTime="649.987" offset="2703339">In fact, the Court went beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.765" offset="2710444">The Court specifically endorsed the Justice Department's original interpretation of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.397" offset="2740955">Furthermore, the reasoning of this Court in Simpson leaves no room for doubt about the true import of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.404" offset="2768959">The Court there found the legislative history instructive not merely because it indicated a congressional version to a cumulative punishment, but because it underlined the limited scope of the provision.</text>
