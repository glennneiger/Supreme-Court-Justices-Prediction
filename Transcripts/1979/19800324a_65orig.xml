            <text syncTime="65.177" offset="364126">This is an original action initiated by the State of Texas over six years ago to enforce the Pecos River Compact, an interstate agreement concerning the distribution of water on the Pecos River.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.608" offset="417834">For the last four years we have been before the Special Master, the Honorable Jean S. Preitenstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.794" offset="442598">During this time the Master has issued two reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.830" offset="458689">The first report was in July 1977, his report on New Mexico's affirmative defenses to our action.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.283" offset="500485">In that report he overruled the affirmative defenses of lack of justiciable controversy, exhaustion, primary jurisdiction, estoppel and laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.433" offset="561089">New Mexico has voiced no objection to that ruling.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.362" offset="636844">New Mexico has not in this most recent round of objections objected to the original report, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.198" offset="668191">The current report is the Master's determination of New Mexico's obligation under Article 3-A of the Pecos River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.002" offset="703404">This is the key provision and let me briefly read it to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.743" offset="718346">It states "New Mexico shall not deplete by man's activities the flow of the Pecos River at the New Mexico-Texas State line below an amount which will give Texas a quantity of water equivalent to that available under the 1947 Condition."</text>
            <text syncTime="172.892" offset="794937">Now, the key phrase here is "the 1947 Condition" which is defined by Article 2-G of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.505" offset="829419">Article 2-G states "The 1947 Condition means that situation in the Pecos River Basin as described and defined in the report of the Engineering Advisory Committee."</text>
            <text syncTime="195.454" offset="885217">It goes on to say "In determining any question of fact hereafter arising as to such situation reference shall be made to and decision shall be based on such report.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.614" offset="953866">"Now, the Engineering Advisory Report is a collection of various reports put together by a committee of engineers that were advising the Compact negotiators prior to the adoption and ratification of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.045" offset="1011545">Texas contends the two Compact provisions I have read to you must be and were intended to be applied literally, i.e. the 1947 Condition is exactly what the Compact says, it is that Condition defined in the engineering report.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.473" offset="1089285">New Mexico would go a step further and extrapolate the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.782" offset="1110497">New Mexico would say that because the engineering reports were intended to reflect conditions existing on the river roughly in 1947, that the 1947 Condition is not as defined by the Compact, it is not that engineering report but rather those conditions which the report was depicting.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.491" offset="1889364">It is directed also, I think, perhaps at the lawyers in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.537" offset="1909530">If you look at the Master's July 1977 report that was accepted by this Court, he initially tried to reach a compromise and essentially told the State "I am going to withhold rulings on three of these affirmative defenses until you all have gone back to the Pecos River Commission and tried to work this out, and I am giving you 18 months to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.061" offset="2007646">Now, shortly after his report came out there was a meeting of the Pecos River Commission and the State had an opportunity to file objections to that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.667" offset="2045994">We filed the objections and he coincidentally received a copy of the transcript of that meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.320" offset="2072639">The combination of the transcript of the meeting and the objections filed convinced the Master that it would serve no purpose to remand the States and give them this opportunity to work it out.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.862" offset="2614836">In 1947 New Mexico irrigators were over-pumping the groundwater system.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.172" offset="2636048">They were drawing water out faster than it would recharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.745" offset="2650363">Consequently if that 1947 pumping continues you have a continued decline of the groundwater aquifer and a continued decrease of the groundwater contribution to the river, based upon the pumping existing in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.739" offset="2714311">The Master's ruling said you did not get the ultimate effect of the 1947 pumping in terms of the depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.781" offset="2750464">All you get is the depletion which was reflected in the river January 1, 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.948" offset="2779199">So New Mexico's is contesting those two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.867" offset="2794872">We are contesting the Master's basic decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.359" offset="2808769">Now, I think it is clear that what the Master was doing was trying to reach an equitable compromise for a difficult problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.138" offset="2871881">I think also that in where the Master made his mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.873" offset="2890898">The Master's job in this case was not to work equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.874" offset="2906885">The Master's job in this case was to enforce the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.062" offset="2923604">Equity had been worked, an equitable apportionment of the water had been reached by virtue of the Compact negotiation process which this Court has repeatedly recommended for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.196" offset="3000195">His decision to essentially divide the baby again after the Compact had fairly well pinned the 1947 Condition to that engineering report.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.759" offset="3050454">The Master is essentially encouraging upstream States involved in interstate compacts now to come in and try for a second bite at the apple if it is working a hardship upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.247" offset="3124328">Let me turn for just a moment to the basis for the Master's decision, the basis he advances in his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.189" offset="3172080">He says that he is convinced that the 1947 Condition refers to a tangible reality as opposed to a bunch of numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.179" offset="3224116">Now, the Master has incorrectly characterized Texas' position insofar as he ties it to the one page of numbers appended to his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.273" offset="3268420">The routing study is considerably more than that and I have addressed that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.057" offset="3303633">I believe when the Compact was drafted the negotiators had a very definite and obvious intent to eliminate the problem of what was the 1947 Condition and what was going on in the river in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.256" offset="3372387">They added the second sentence to the definition which says in solving any question of fact pertaining to the 1947 Condition you look to the engineering report and the decision is made based upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.886" offset="3434872">There is only one other definition in the Compact that has a second sentence to it like that and that is Article 2-E which defines deplete by man's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.775" offset="3478444">It states a definition of depletion by man's activities which essentially makes it the same thing as beneficial consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.522" offset="3513448">It then has a second sentence which states for purposes of this Compact it does not include diminution of flow by encroachment of salt cedars or other like group or by a deterioration of the channel of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.050" offset="3575620">Now, Texas in good faith could not argue that man's activities included channel deterioration.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.579" offset="3605713">Because of the way a reservoir was operated, although physically it is possible to make a connection in terms of causation this article clearly prohibits us from making such an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.045" offset="3659525">Similarly, in terms of the spread of salt cedars man's activities can't encroach that but we could not begin to advance that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.074" offset="3691708">Yet Article 2-G's second sentence makes it equally clear that the 1947 Condition is to be tied to that engineering report available to the Compact negotiators upon which the Compact was based.</text>

            <text syncTime="1169.085" offset="4779760">What happened in the Compact negotiations was the engineering committee performed a number of routing studies such as the one you are looking at now or each resulted in summaries like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1191.650" offset="4869935">And by "development," I mean irrigation, reservoirs, uses of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.671" offset="4890102">Now, using that virgin condition is a simplistic model the engineers would then superimpose upon it stages of development of uses on the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.253" offset="4936391">So they would impose the reservoirs that existed in 1947, they would the irrigation projects that were being irrigated in 1947, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.758" offset="4978395">And then for each year they ran the water down the river, adding and subtracting for each of these gains and losses on the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="1528.027" offset="6215450">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.369" offset="6228825">I would like to respond quickly to your concern, Mr. Justice Stevens, and try to explain to you just what that 41-column routing study is and its relation to the question of whether or not the 1947 Condition is real or artificial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.117" offset="6307819">That question appears as Item No. 4-A in the Master's pre-trial order of October 31, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.986" offset="6347316">Under Item 4-B of that pre-trial order there were 11 additional issues that were raised, each of which related to whether or not the original 1947 Condition study as it appears in Appendix A in the Special Master's report should have been corrected factually and engineeringly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.509" offset="6433416">The first one of those issues related to the use by the Pecos River Commission in its restudy of the Condition in the 'Fifties of revised USGS stream flow records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.239" offset="6484302">The stream flow data that was originally available did not change but the USGS had determined that it was improperly reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.785" offset="6522546">The accuracy of the revised data was not disputed by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.050" offset="6539577">Well, the errors in the original study show up most conspicuously in Appendix A in columns 1, column 13, column 25 and column 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.314" offset="6592658">Those are the columns which were designed to describe, in effect, the rainfall and the snow melt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.141" offset="6619930">To give you an example of the magnitude of the difficulty, New Mexico's Exhibit No. 37 before the Master shows that 54 percent of the monthly calculations in column 1 in the original study were significantly in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.295" offset="6688580">Well, the net effect of that was to mathematically put more water in the river into State line than would have gotten there under the 1947 Condition for each of the historic years that they attempted to route water down the river through that Condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.635" offset="6761932">And that Condition is all of the reservoirs on the stream, three major reservoirs, the channel losses between the reservoirs, all of the diversion works and the irrigation depletions that actually existed in the Basin in '47.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.542" offset="6825566">Another of those 4-B issues that are still back before the Master relates to column 12 in the routing study in Appendix A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.384" offset="6864959">That is artesian inflow and that relates to that part of the study that attempted to describe channel gains and losses between Alamogordo Reservoir to the north and McMillan Reservoir to the south, while the Pecos River Commission determined that the original study put about 9,600 acre-feet per year too much into the river resulting in a corresponding State line exaggeration of New Mexico's delivery obligation of approximately 4,800 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.630" offset="7005915">In other words, if the agreement embodies in the Compact is the real 1947 Condition as opposed to its first attempted description the use of the erroneous description would administratively add about 4,800 acre-feet annually to New Mexico's obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.251" offset="7096404">Another of those 4-B issues relates to column 10 in Appendix A and that relates to channel loss between Alamogordo Reservoir to the north and a gage called Acme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.499" offset="7173413">The Pecos River Commission in its study in the 'Fifties determined that the original Appendix A study showed that the losses were about 16,500 acre-feet per year too small.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.958" offset="7223254">Well, that had the corresponding effect of inflating New Mexico's obligation under the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.005" offset="7251362">If you look to column 16, that relates to salt cedar depletion in a delta area above McMillan Reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.629" offset="7289919">There the Pecos River Commission and the engineer advisors to the Commission determined that the original study understated the depletion by 23,900 acre-feet a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.053" offset="7339551">Just above that on the Exhibit -- stipulated Exhibit No. 2 is column 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.986" offset="7371316">That relates to farmers pumping water out of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.666" offset="7386049">There the Pecos River Commission and the engineer advisors determined that the original study -- in the original study the wrong acreage was used and also the wrong depletion rate was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.080" offset="7435682">That had the mathematical effect of deflating column 14 by about 6,500 acre-feet a year and inflating column 41 at the State line by a corresponding amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="1890.822" offset="7666709">In the negotiation period what they did was finally decide to freeze conditions in New Mexico as of 1947.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.781" offset="7802546">They did it first of all because all of the engineer advisors thought it would be unwise to predicate this Compact on what is called a schedule, that is, you know, so much water coming in up here that means that so much water has got to go out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.749" offset="7862418">You simply right that down and you enter an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.745" offset="7874330">The hydrology of the river is too complicated largely because of all of the phreatophytes on the river and the difficulty they were having there, which we will discuss in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.394" offset="7916962">What they did was use the Condition as a way of freezing development in the State of New Mexico and then they ran that Condition of frozen development through year historically between 1905 through 1946 when they ran out of data at the time and attempted to assess by doing that how the river would have behaved historically given the existence of the '47 Condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.202" offset="8052172">It was that real live Condition on the stream that they wanted to look at and they wanted to get some idea of how the river would behave in future years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2191.942" offset="8871163">It says "The 1948 report of the Engineering Advisory Committee includes that report, the appendices thereto, the basic data and processes and analyses used in preparing it, all of which were reviewed, adopted and approved as shown in the minutes of the meeting of December 3, 1948."</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.986" offset="8963323">There Royce Tipton explained this Compact to the negotiators and to the Commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.518" offset="8997491">Each provision of the Pecos River Compact was explicitly adopted subject to his explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.687" offset="9022151">In explaining Article 2-G he said the 1947 Condition relates to a condition on the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.696" offset="9054124">There were certain conditions of the river such as the diversionary requirements of the Carlabad project, the salt cedar consumption, the reservoir capacities that existed in 1947, the operation of the Fort Summer project up to 6,500 acres and the operation of all other projects on the stream as they actually existed in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.713" offset="9150255">I don't think there is a clearer statement that the 1947 Condition as envisaged by the engineer advisors and the Commissioners who finally signed the Compact was indeed the reality on the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.484" offset="9265298">Perhaps the most compelling bit of evidence that should persuade the Court that New Mexico's view of the 1947 Condition and the Master's view of the 1947 Condition is correct is the fact that the Pecos River Commissioners, all of the engineer advisors involved in the negotiation of the Compact themselves sought to correct that description before they personally believed that they should do any administration under the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.174" offset="9408031">I would point out that the people that corrected it, the deadwood is called the review of basic data and ended up with what is shown as Appendix B in the Master's report a second description of the 1947 Condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.012" offset="9459440">Those were the same actors working on the Commission -- working for the Peciso River Commission in the 'Fifties as were there negotiating and adopting the Compact in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.145" offset="9515969">Well, the legal side of this question relates to the power of the Pecos River Commission to make the corrections it actually made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.325" offset="9556720">We feel that that is answered clearly and conclusively by Article 6-C of the Compact and that reads "Unless and until a more feasible method is devised and adopted by the Commission the inflow-outflow method as described in the report of the Engineering Advisory Committee shall be used to determine the effect on the State line flow of any change in depletion by man's activities or otherwise."</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.693" offset="9666121">When Mr. Tipton talked of that article he said the way the Pecos Compact is written the Commission has full authority to change the method or perfect the technique so long as what is done by the Commission is something directed at the determination under Article 3-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.190" offset="9744175">To avoid or to obviate the significance of Article 6-C, what Texas tries to do is draw a distinction between the routing study as it is used administratively in the Compact and what is called the inflow-outflow technique of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.091" offset="9807705">Well, you can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.693" offset="9814183">The only utility of that routing study in the actual administration of the Compact is to construct an inflow-outflow plate, a plate that you can -- in administrative years you go out on the river, you gather up inflow data for three years running, you go back to this plate and plug into the inflow side of the plate and you come out with an indicated outflow that should define New Mexico's obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.336" offset="9928704">Well, the routing study for administrative purposes is as integral a part of the technique as is the gathering of data during administrative years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.984" offset="9967261">Indeed, it is the very backbone of the inflow-outflow method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.779" offset="9986487">Well, if you throw out the inflow-outflow method as the Commission is expressly authorized to do by Article 6-C you throw out the whole inflow-outflow manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.907" offset="10039045">You also throw out Plate 2 and you also throw out the routing study, at least for administrative purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.672" offset="10070079">What you are left with is the 1947 Condition on the stream which is precisely the same condition that the engineering advisors tried to better ascertain by attempting to correct the engineering input into the inflow-outflow method instead of totally abandoning the method and starting off with something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.831" offset="10158686">This answer that I am giving you is precisely the same answer that the Attorney General of Texas gave to the Texas Water Rights Commission in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.041" offset="10203512">The cooperative work of the Pecos River Commission was sought to be repudiated unilaterally by the Texas River Commissioner not until 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.170" offset="10252100">But to start his efforts he requested that the Texas Water Rights Commission put this very question to the Attorney General of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.581" offset="10289716">He answered it in precisely the same way I just answered it for the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2553.638" offset="10317928">Yes, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.350" offset="10324720">It appears -- it is Texas Attorney General M-535, it is dated December 5, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.653" offset="10362023">I would refer you to pages 2547 to 2551 of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.891" offset="10398908">Texas also tries to rely on Article 6-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.632" offset="10425866">There Article 6-A reads "The report of the Engineering Advisory Committee supplemented by additional data hereafter accumulated shall be used in making administrative determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.117" offset="10479888">Well, Texas emphasizes the phrase "in making administrative determinations."</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.876" offset="10498905">If you look at the simple grammar of that article what is supplemented is the original report, not the data, that is picked up and gathered during the administrative period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.553" offset="10549582">That also comports with Mr. Tipton's explanation that the Pecos River Commission, and I am quoting him, "as time goes on may more nearly perfect the curves which appear in the Engineering Advisory Committee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.149" offset="10611963">Well, the administrative history we think is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.063" offset="10627636">Texas tries to distinguish somehow between what happened before 1957 and what happened after 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.870" offset="10662849">We don't think that distinction is tenable and there the record will not support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.913" offset="10686986">We would refer you to pages 11 through 26 of our reply brief and 20 through 41 of the brief in support of our objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.993" offset="10727320">Also to agree with Texas' objection in this regard would be to condone the attempted unilateral repudiation of bilateral Compact action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.547" offset="10777579">I believe this Court has consistently though it has only had a couple of occasions on which to do it, but it has consistently voided any unilateral State action designed to define obligations under Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.551" offset="10833586">In Dyer v. Simms the West Virginia Supreme Court tried to relieve West Virginia of its obligations under a multi-State Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.502" offset="10873396">Here no coordinate branch of the Texas State government tried to do it; the Texas Pecos Commissioner tried to do it himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.043" offset="10903594">He never made a motion before the Commission and certainly no effort was made to revoke the Compact pursuant to Article 14 of its terms by seeking the State's revocation of their ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.486" offset="10969318">Texas has argued we believe wrongly on the law that well, both States are simply stuck for the study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.470" offset="11001292">I would point out another error in the inflow-outflow manual that if we were stuck with, as the Master has ruled, that needs to be corrected as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.655" offset="11037968">If we were stuck with that, it would by Texas' own analysis cost them 42,000 acre-feet per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.036" offset="11079555">I think the answer to the fact that we aren't stuck with the study derives simply from the fact that the 1947 Condition is not what you see in Appendix A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.063" offset="11127620">Well, the other half of this case relates to base flow diminution and the problem of water salvage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.587" offset="11157713">And I think that is really why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.771" offset="11170461">We aren't here because there has been a bunch of gluttonous development in New Mexico since 1947, we aren't here because of changes in depletions in New Mexico since 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.812" offset="11222601">We are here because of the failure to offset anticipated declines in the flow of the river by water salvage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.555" offset="11273592">Toward the end of Compact negotiations the engineer advisors advised the Commissioners of two facts, essentially, that in the McMillan Delta above that reservoir was a huge floodway of phreatophytes, phreatophytes that were non-beneficially consuming about 39,000 acre-feet of water each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.724" offset="11366275">They knew that there was some likelihood of salvaging water from that ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.605" offset="11397831">On the other hand, they knew that the pumping in the area that I showed you on the map, the area between Roswell and Artesia, if continued at the depletion rate of 1947 would ultimately decrease the base flow of the river just below there approximately 40,000 acre-feet a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.317" offset="11480691">Well, what they attempted to do was come up with a mechanism, a remedial mechanism to keep the river whole over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.201" offset="11516217">Well, the real reason we are here today is because there has not been effected any water salvage, and that is the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.621" offset="11545893">The whole scheme was to make it so that according to Article 1 of the Compact we could maintain the uses not just in New Mexico but in both States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.931" offset="11603048">Our objection to the Master's report in this regard goes to his failure, in our view, to really appreciate the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.671" offset="11638053">He did not weigh in the balance the water salvage provisions on the one hand and the base flow diminution problem on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.059" offset="11683610">In response to our objections before him in that regard he said that salvage has nothing to do with the 1947 Condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.949" offset="11719137">Well, quite the contrary, Article 3-A says that New Mexico shall not deplete the flow of the Pecos River at the State line below an amount which will give to Texas a quantity of water equivalent to that available under the 1947 Condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.317" offset="11780681">Now, it is that concept of equivalence that facilitates the substitution of source of supply in New Mexico as base flow declines with water salvaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.427" offset="11833031">The intent again was to keep the river whole over time and the Compact, as I say, is essentially remedial in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.722" offset="11870229">The question of what happens when salvage is not effected to offset that base flow diminution is not addressed by the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.633" offset="11913906">There is testimony on it by John Erickson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.729" offset="11926340">He was asked the question of what happened and he said, "I don't think they ever considered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.183" offset="11944103">If the Compact worked as anticipated, you wouldn't get to the problem."</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.852" offset="11962807">Well, all you can do is look to the salvage provisions of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.099" offset="11987780">They mandate in Article 4 cooperative salvage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.367" offset="12000841">When Mr. Tipton explained the Compact he said that the Compact by its terms mandates salvage in order to make it work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.765" offset="12038457">Also I would point out that the record shows that the New Mexico legislature would not have ratified the Compact if that burden is not shared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.681" offset="12074088">The alternative would have been an immediate and very drastic outback in irrigated acreage in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.755" offset="12102405">While Texas has referred to our construction of the Compact as ludicrous in saying that it removes salvage from the realm of possibility, well, that was precisely the design of the Compact over time, 40 years from when the Compact was ratified, that is exactly what they contemplated, they would have salvaged enough water from eradicating phreatophytes to offset the base flow diminution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.708" offset="12218180">And from that point on everybody would have lived happily ever after.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.966" offset="12243257">Well, the consequences unfortunately are that both States are suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.134" offset="12259871">Texas is not bearing this burden alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.621" offset="12269902">There has been a drastic water shortage in the State of New Mexico and continues to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.526" offset="12289442">Shortage is a fact that crosses the State line and I think obviously transcends the sovereignty that generated this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.080" offset="12331656">Finally, there is one other matter in issue, one other matter to which we objected, and that is the Master's conclusion that the 1947 Condition though albeit reality should have ended December 31, 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.259" offset="12400410">Well, he reached that as a supposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.530" offset="12409501">He said because in the original study they only used the period 1905 to 1946 the engineers must have intended to exclude the year 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.145" offset="12459969">Well, in this regard we would like to rely on our briefs but I do want to respond very quickly to six items in Texas' reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.783" offset="12490480">First, Texas argues that phrases like "in 1947" and "during 1947" were simply loose references or convenient shorthand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.784" offset="12526529">Well, they are very anomalous loose references and convenient shorthand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.165" offset="12544084">On the contrary, if they wanted a 1946 Condition they would have so named it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.466" offset="12565191">Texas also states that there is no evidence in the record to support the fact that the 1946 photographs that we talked about were interpolated against 1946 photographs to better ascertain the 1947 Condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.925" offset="12631124">Texas argues aside from the accusation that they were really after salt cedar acreage and salt cedar acreage alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.304" offset="12664560">Well, the fact of the existence of the photographs to which we referred you will find in stipulated Exhibit No. 4 and the fact that they were interpolating to determine irrigation in 1947 as well as salt cedar acreage you will find in stipulated Exhibit No. 6 both of them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Simms</label>
            <text syncTime="3221.590" offset="12989733">Then all the errors, the erroneous description and everything else as it were is the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.447" offset="13017109">The parties to the Compact themselves however did not have that view, as their actions we think unequivocally demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.214" offset="13052217">Texas also says that in Plates 5 through 10 in the inflow-outflow manual the inclusion of 1947 data was insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.838" offset="13094745">Well, those plates were reach by reach inflow-outflow routing studies to determine the 1947 Condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.969" offset="13135287">They did indeed include the year 1947 in those individual curves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.995" offset="13167365">If they did not want the year 1947 to be a part of the base line curve against which you would later make administrative determinations there is no reason why you would have included that data except to conclude that the year '47 is a part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.211" offset="13256182">Also in the review of basic data itself undertaken over a number of years Texas simply says the review of basic data on this point is dubious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.447" offset="13293171">Well, it is not dubious at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.614" offset="13297873">It shows the contemporaneous understanding of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.829" offset="13310725">They are the sane actors involved in all of this, the entire review was orchestrated by Royce Tipton who was an internationally famous hydrologist and the advisor to the Federal representative on this Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.018" offset="13371434">Texas makes a fifth point saying that well, the first administrative years, the first administrative determinations were done through the three-year period 1947 to 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.614" offset="13417827">Well, the simple answer to that is the Pecos River Commission later determined that they should not have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.029" offset="13443532">One final point, Your Honors, New Mexico tendered evidence on this subject and the Master concluded that that evidence was speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.220" offset="13484283">Our witness was John Erickson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.201" offset="13492224">New Mexico's advisor, engineering advisor to the negotiating Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.906" offset="13515003">He said the simple reason they didn't use it then was because they didn't have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.819" offset="13530676">If they did have it they would have used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.340" offset="13540707">We would suggest quite the contrary, that it was the Master's supposition that it was speculative and not at all with John Erickson whose testimony the Master described as speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.907" offset="13595042">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.395" offset="13600998">Do you have anything further, Mr. Caroom?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="douglas_g_caroom" startTime="3377.534" stopTime="3501.781">
            <label>Mr. Douglas G. Caroom</label>
            <text syncTime="3377.534" offset="13613537">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.971" offset="13627225">Let me initially touch upon a point Mr. Simms has recently made saying that the players in the review of basic data, the people who conducted the restudy of the 1947 Condition routing study were the negotiators, the same people who did the Compact and that this has some special significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.168" offset="13712071">That is simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.453" offset="13721161">The players up until 1957 were very much the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.188" offset="13740074">Now, in my brief I go through the history up to 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.134" offset="13755956">But what we have basically is a document called the inflow-outflow manual that gives you directions for figuring out each year whether or not New Mexico has complied with their obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.665" offset="13806007">That document has some mistakes in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.297" offset="13816560">It wasn't even drafted and available until after the Compact was signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.559" offset="13837563">Now, that document, the inflow-outflow manual caused problems in the early administration of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.178" offset="13864103">And the engineers, the same ones who worked on the Compact, participated in an effort to review that document and to rewrite it and conduct an accounting as it should have been done under the original report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.697" offset="13918124">That was done by a subcommittee of the Engineers Committee in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.678" offset="13942053">It showed New Mexico 128,000 acre-feet behind in deliveries and it was turned down by the Engineering Advisory Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.419" offset="13981027">Now, it was turned down because the New Mexico representative voted against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.928" offset="13999104">The New Mexico representative was a State engineer who had recently come in and had nothing whatsoever to do with the negotiation of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.766" offset="14034422">The subsequent engineering study which took place from '57 to '60 was so far as New Mexico was concerned directed by that same State engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.619" offset="14077889">The Taxes engineer who had worked on the original studies did not participate in it and in fact he died mid-way through it.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3501.781" offset="14110490">I take it that the Special Master was aware of these factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.509" offset="14129403">Perhaps he didn't give them the significance you think they deserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.627" offset="14145912">But he was aware of all of them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Douglas G. Caroom</label>
            <text syncTime="3512.347" offset="14152808">He was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.529" offset="14157511">I think the key to the Special Master's treatment of the engineering report is to his own admission very forthrightly in his report that he doesn't understand this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.206" offset="14200247">He says this is a legal question, I am going to rely on my technical assistant to solve the engineering questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.140" offset="14223966">I am treating this as a legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.360" offset="14232848">But in spite of that it appears that a major factor in the Master's decision was his perception that something was wrong with the original report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.602" offset="14277778">Now, we had a witness, Frank Dowell, who was head of USGS in the Western United States, or assistant head, who testified he independently reviewed it, it was a good study, it was workable, it was checked by the engineers who did it at the time and it looked good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.397" offset="14344965">It was independently checked by Mr. Bell subsequently when he was retained by the State of Texas and he was convinced it was a sound, workable study.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.419" offset="14381014">The subsequent engineering study has more bells than whistles, it is fancier, the engineers think it is a better product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.401" offset="14409017">But it is definitely biased; it is definitely biased to reduce deliveries to New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.567" offset="14437648">Now, let me respond briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.664" offset="14446007">Mr. Simms attempted to give an explanation for the second sentence of Article 2-G.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.584" offset="14469726">He said the Engineer Advisors Committee report includes more than the routing study.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.881" offset="14494908">Now, this is discussed at a little bit of length in my brief but the only part of the Engineer Advisors report that defines the 1947 Condition is the routing study.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.234" offset="14540257">There is the inflow-outflow manual that was adopted after the Compact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3612.860" offset="14554781">That by the way is the only matter attached to the Master's report that has any 1947 data in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.922" offset="14599084">The routing study doesn't have any '47 data in it, does it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3680.070" offset="14823633">Let me make one other brief point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.944" offset="14835127">Mr. Simms said this inflow-outflow manual cannot be separated from the routing study and he apparently sold Judge Breitenstein on this idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.523" offset="14873475">And it is just flat wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.962" offset="14883192">The inflow-outflow manual is an instruction manual that tells you how to do the annual computation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.647" offset="14909942">It tells you what the steps are to use the 1947 Condition routing study and compare the annual deliveries on the river to see if there has been compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.131" offset="14951946">The inflow-outflow manual has errors in it, it left out part of the water coming in below, the Alamogordo Reservoir down to Acme; it just flat left out that part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.779" offset="14994474">It was a mistake and it made other mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.089" offset="15007744">But the standard is there in the routing study without the inflow-outflow manual.</text>
