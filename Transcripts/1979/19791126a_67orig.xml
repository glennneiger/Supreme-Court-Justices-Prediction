            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 67, Original, the State of Idaho and others v. the States of Oregon and Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.113" offset="155773">Mr. Leroy, Mr. Attorney General, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_leroy" startTime="26.346" stopTime="320.705">
            <label>Mr. David H. Leroy</label>
            <text syncTime="26.346" offset="208750">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.267" offset="220453">Idaho appears for the second time before the Court in its effort to seek a fair share of Idaho-raised and Idaho-returning anadromous fish runs.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.284" offset="256502">This Court's opinion earlier this year in July in Washington v. United States made the Court again familiar with the general nature of these fish and the general issues regarding allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.902" offset="303000">However, the Idaho case is very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.649" offset="313971">We are dealing here with the Columbia River system only.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.876" offset="326928">There is an existing District Court and Ninth Circuit-affirmed allocation order and management plan which already equitably divides up the treaty and non-treaty shares of fish between the Indians so entitled in the States of Oregon and Washington, and that equitable division is not contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.515" offset="401429">Idaho makes no claim in this case against Indian Treaty fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.447" offset="417207">Rather, it seeks only a further equitable distribution of the already established non-treaty shares to include Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.168" offset="452002">Nevertheless, we appear this morning at grave procedural disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.207" offset="468198">If this Court accepts the recommendation of its distinguished Master it will dismiss Idaho's case before we reach the obvious merits which that same Master finds in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.028" offset="511457">The facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.006" offset="519398">The Columbia River for the last 300 miles of its course to the Pacific Ocean becomes the boundary line dividing Oregon and Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.744" offset="554297">The Snake River flows through Idaho and then into Washington to join the Columbia, becoming its principal tributary.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.758" offset="582405">In Idaho there are over 3,000 miles of spawning habitat for anadromous fish, freshwater fish which after a two-year life cycle migrate to the ocean to share a similar cycle there, then return to their native waters to spawn and propagate the species.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.354" offset="644786">In 1918 Washington and Oregon with the blessing of Congress created a Columbia River Compact to administer the non-treaty fishery rights and to cooperate with Indian rights under 1855 treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.175" offset="700061">For 40 to 60 years last past Idaho has sought membership unsuccessfully in this Compact by entreaties to Oregon and to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.196" offset="736110">In 1969 disputes between the Indian and non-Indian fishery on the Columbia River resulted in two pieces of litigation being consolidated and being decided in the District Court of Oregon, Sohappy v. Smith and The United States v. Oregon regarding Oregon's regulation scheme of the Indian fish and its impact on the Indian fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.872" offset="814895">The United States as tribal trustee in those District Court cases was a voluntary party and is accordingly bound by the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.514" offset="845406">In 1974 the District Court in Oregon amended the earlier decree to establish a 50-50 allocation between treaty and non-treaty rights of the anadromous fish which was affirmed in 1976 by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.054" offset="903607">And in 1977 the parties, including the United States and including Oregon and Washington, entered into a voluntary agreement which in some slight parts amended the prior decree and established a basic framework for the counting, distribution and allocation of those fish into the two shares and establishing zones of fishery, the non-treaty zone being established in the first 140 miles of the river from the ocean upstream to Bonneville Dam and the treaty Indian fishery zone being established as Zone 6 from Bonneville Dam 130 miles further up the Columbia River.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.665" offset="1049997">In 1975 Idaho sought leave of this Court to file a complaint seeking two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.536" offset="1073507">First, membership in the compact; and secondly, an equitable apportionment of three of those anadromous fish runs, the spring chinook salmon, the summer chinook salmon and the summer steelhead trout.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.559" offset="1129618">We urged in that litigation that where more than half of the returning adults which reentered the Columbia River had been raised in Idaho and would return if unimpeded to Idaho, that current management practices of the defendants both denied Idaho a fair share of those fish and gravely threatened the propagation and continued existence of the species.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.499" offset="1221360">We were granted by this Court after oral argument, leave to file the complaint as to the equitable apportionment issue only.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.684" offset="1250095">This Court appointed the Honorable Jean Breitenstein Master and in due course, on July 31, 1978, he issued an initial report with three conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.035" offset="1287502">Number one, that the complaint stated a justiciable controversy; and that the pendency of U.S. v. Oregon was no bar to this action, to which findings both Oregon and Washington accepted; and third was that the U.S. did not consent to this suit, that it had a number of interrelated interests and that this decree without the presence of the United States in the litigation could not provide an adequate remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.139" offset="1487914">Number one, that the Federal interest in this matter could be adequately represented by amicus-type status; secondly, that the finding of indefensibility by the Master was in error; third, that a determination by this Court of the matter would not unduly burden the Court; and fourth, that the alternative of mutual accommodation was not available.</text>

            <text syncTime="704.657" offset="2922036">Partly the Master found favorably to Idaho under Rule 19 because the narrow framing of the issue, he found that there would be no prejudice to the United States, that there would be no loss of U.S. rights; and, secondly, he found that Idaho would have no other -- no adequate remedy of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1158.741" offset="4738382">Your Honor, as I suggested in answer to your earlier question we feel that the Master's focus, regardless of term, was the adequacy of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.933" offset="4771088">One of his problems was the problem that we just discussed that the Idaho benefit as to the Indian rights could not pass through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.531" offset="4801494">I have attempted to suggest that in fact it would be a pass through just as the escapement is and Idaho could enforce that by intervention if it so had to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.293" offset="4836498">In addition, the operation of the dams by the United States in a specific fishery we suggest are factually irrelevant to the relief that we seek and so I would not follow the Court's reasoning in suggesting that the term be different but in fact the adequacy of the judgment can be preserved regardless of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.779" offset="4914448">We argue also that the Master was incorrect in suggesting that the operation of the United States of dams -- eight dams on the Columbia River made them a party whose presence is required in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.940" offset="4967111">There are eight dams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.732" offset="4974320">Those dams each create reservoirs or pools, they create spills, they have fish ladders, they alter stream flows, and all of those factors kill fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.113" offset="5015803">But in a sense of relevancy to this matter and interrelationship, that problem, the mortality of the fish, in that fashion is not relevant to the relief sought or the judgment requested in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.888" offset="5066898">The focus here is the equitable apportionment between the three States of adult fish regardless of whatever supply that reenter the Columbia River at its mouth on their up turn, upstream migration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.112" offset="5119770">At the mouth of the Columbia River for the first time these fish become the subject of commercial and sport fishery in the river; and for the first time they become subject to an actual count which can be apportioned between.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.521" offset="5177448">Thus, we urge that the Master's concern with the operations of the dam as to downstream migration is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.968" offset="5207228">It may affect the total supply but it does not relate to the right of a portion of those adult fish reentering which we seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.375" offset="5236903">As to the upstream migration, three factors make that factually irrelevant as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.083" offset="5255711">The apportionment occurs at and before the first dam, thus U.S. operations are not in a position to affect the calculation of the basic equities and numbers between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.056" offset="5303568">Secondly, the upstream losses are certain, are capable of calculation and thus can be factored into a scheme of equitable apportionment, such as this Court has done in some water loss and water passage cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.138" offset="5351946">And third, the Federal statutes as judicially interpreted require a sensitivity by the United States Government, particularly the Anadromous Fish Act, and subject the United States to waiver so that any inappropriate activity cutting off, in effect, a share of benefit that should be passed to Idaho in the upstream dam we urge can be attacked in the courts and prevented as a loss to Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.525" offset="5449435">And the third point upon which we suggest the Master was not correct in his ruling is that the ocean management and the ocean fishery management made the United States in some way indispensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.763" offset="5494471">The ocean catch occurs exclusively between 3 and 200 miles under the authority of the Secretary of Commerce, it is regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.050" offset="5531564">Idaho sits on a specific regional fishery management council as a full voting member along with Oregon and Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.364" offset="5556851">And neither the Secretary nor the council has any authority in the river itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.933" offset="5923088">The decree sought in this case is a final judicial judgment of three components.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.855" offset="5954748">Number one, a declaration of Idaho's entitlement to an equitable apportionment in certain fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.124" offset="5983901">Secondly, an establishment of an approximate percentage based on scientific evidence of each species.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.515" offset="6005426">And Third, the projection of those percentages into a set of figures and structures decreeing basic numbers of fish, depending on size of the run under two conditions - poor passage where many of the fish will not get upstream, and under good passage where most of the fish in relative terms will get upstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.563" offset="6077628">We would also urge the Court that continuing jurisdiction is no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.372" offset="6092884">The Court has retained its jurisdiction where necessary for modifications or amendments in equitable apportionment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.372" offset="6124857">But this Court has avoided involving itself in active, daily supervision and nonjudicial style functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.780" offset="6154533">There is nothing about this as the basic apportionment case or from the type of decree sought that would require this Court's active daily supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.947" offset="6187133">In fact, as I have suggested, the Columbia River compact exists though Idaho has for 60 years attempted to become a member of that compact unsuccessfully.</text>

Oregon in 1936 this Court, dealing with what was then an inequitable claim by Washington to water going down the Walla Walla River, found that if Oregon irrigators were cut off very little of that water would get to Washington anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="3594.811" offset="14482578">The facts as this Master has found them, the effect of dams managed exclusively by the United States means that an allocation of Washington and Oregon fish to Idaho would take a huge number of fish out of the Washington and Oregon fisheries and produce very little.</text>

            <text syncTime="3722.058" offset="14991653">Well, Idaho has also asked that some of the commercial fishing runs on Washington-origin fish be cut off or be restricted because there is an incidental part of some of some of these runs in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.926" offset="15055078">The runs slightly overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.402" offset="15068975">They would have us, among other things, maybe lose a hundred fish so that one fish could get back up to Idaho because a few strays from one of these runs might still be fit, swimming up the river at the same time of various other runs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.630" offset="15117876">That does go to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.665" offset="15126026">But the point is that the United State is an indispensable party because in the state of this case with only the States in it and not the United States which controls the fisheries, the dams and of course is trustee for the Indians, there is no possibility of a judgment of a right or a remedy, either, which will do justice to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.525" offset="15213484">We will simply end up losing all kinds of fish while Idaho gains nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.964" offset="15235218">If the United States is in the litigation -- and why it is not is for Mr. Claiborne to tell you -- if the United States is in the litigations, then any decree which the Court came out with would be enforced against everyone who impacts the fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.727" offset="15290284">And we might very well claim a right to fish in the ocean which you are returning to Oregon and Washington, which the United States ignores at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.730" offset="15326333">We would be happy to litigate that with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.485" offset="15337305">We can't litigate it without the United States in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.219" offset="15348276">Therefore we can't be done justice in this case without the United States in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3924.305" offset="15800613">And I believe the Secretary of the Interior dispensed the water and controlled its every stage, it was viewed as impossible to have [ILLEGIBLE WORDS] it not run against him and, indeed, the ultimate decree runs entirely against the Secretary of the Interior as to what dispensations of water it shall make, indicates the present effective rights to the respective States and other parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.577" offset="15921716">Let me address the question asked by the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.949" offset="15943137">The United States, as the Court is no doubt aware in light of the documents published by Idaho, hesitated, considered, reconsidered the question whether it should hold its sovereign immunity as a bar to this lawsuit, feeling some sympathy with the claim of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.065" offset="16043656">At the end of the day it was determined that the United States ought not intervene and allow the proceeding to go forward, partly because it was our judgment, rightly or not, that the opportunities for an amicable accommodation of this lawsuit had not been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.808" offset="16138637">The four years that have passed since this Court last dealt with the suit have unfortunately not been occupied in very useful negotiations between the States and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.278" offset="16204466">We also took the view, perhaps wrongly, that although Idaho would say we don't want to disturb the Indian rights, we don't want to disturb the operation of the dams, we don't want to in any way control the management of the ocean fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.418" offset="16281057">The defendant States might be fully entitled to say those methods affect what may be a fair apportionment of the resource because the size of the pie has much to do with how you fairly divide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.287" offset="16348557">And, indeed, the plan in the District Court depends on the size of the pie as to what shares go to the Indians, what share goes to the commercial fisheries in Washington and Oregon, and what share escapes to Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.078" offset="16415640">No one has suggested that a one-third, one-third, one-third division, no matter what the run, is appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4263.921" offset="17159084">Because that decree provides for a forum which is premised on accepting escapement into Idaho.</text>

            <text syncTime="4543.253" offset="18276394">I would emphasize only four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.313" offset="18288619">First, this is a narrowly drafted pleading focused on the apportionment sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.744" offset="18310353">As the adult fish reentering the mouth of the Columbia River, for the first time at that point, and for the first time only, do they become subject as adults to fishery in the Columbia River and for the first time they are subject of relatively precise calculation in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.961" offset="18371166">That is the right place to determine the equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.104" offset="18383809">Therefore, it is irrelevant as to what the passage losses down are and, picking up the Solicitor's analogy, it is also irrelevant what the losses are because in the case of the pie the actual weight and the actual volume of the pie may vary because of the size.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.615" offset="18445876">But the basic equities of apportionment as between those three partners will not vary, depending on the size of the pie.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.516" offset="18469386">Secondly, we would claim only as to upstream fish which will go over Bonneville Dam and return to Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.048" offset="18495613">The Master's report specifically at page 10 found that Idaho produces many fish and receives few.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.479" offset="18521318">The number of those fish that go to Idaho and the number by the same token that stay in Oregon and Washington are subject to calculation and can be distributed into that equitable formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.158" offset="18559979">Third, Indian rights are not affected or attacked in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.942" offset="18579101">Idaho seeks distribution only from the Oregon and Washington share.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.241" offset="18592371">We have no quarrel with the 50-percent Indian share.</text>
