            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="46.793" offset="290565">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.588" offset="301746">This case comes here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.561" offset="329644">The question presented involves the enforceability of an Internal Revenue Service summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.133" offset="355871">The question before the Court is whether the Internal Revenue Service has the statutory authority to issue a summons requiring a person to appear and execute handwriting exemplars in aid of an administrative investigation to determine his correct tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.802" offset="426611">The facts are relatively simple and undisputed and I can summarize them quickly, as follows In October 1977, Special Agent Patrick Finnessey was assigned to investigate respondent Euge's tax liability for the period 1973 through 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.730" offset="510307">This period came to the attention of the Internal Revenue Service because the respondent had filed no tax returns for any of these years and he had sought no extensions for the filing of these returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.015" offset="559417">The case had been referred to the Intelligence Division by the Audit and Collection Division after it had been determined that no tax returns were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.327" offset="600691">The special agent determined to compute the respondent's tax liability by means of the bank deposits method.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.728" offset="634232">So the scrutiny focused on respondent's bank accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.117" offset="651891">Now, respondent had two bank accounts in his own name but the investigation revealed that there were 20 other bank accounts, the bank statements of which were sent to post office boxes in respondent's names.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.741" offset="706330">These bank accounts were in other names and there were signature cards on file with these 20 different bank accounts that bore addresses of properties owned by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.790" offset="758575">Moreover, there were frequent transfers between these bank accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.659" offset="778010">These facts suggested to the agent that respondent was maintaining bank accounts under aliases to conceal taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.264" offset="824404">The amounts were substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.230" offset="832240">For 1975, these 20 different bank accounts had an aggregate balance of approximately $50,000 and for '76, it was something like $30,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.566" offset="885635">Special agent served a summons on respondent requiring him to appear and execute handwriting exemplars of the various signatures on these bank accounts, so that he could take these handwriting exemplars and submit them for handwriting analysis by an Internal Revenue Service handwriting laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.851" offset="974764">Respondent stated --</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="219.191" offset="980093">Mr. Smith, Mr. Euge is here on an in forma pauperis basis, isn't he?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="224.519" stopTime="510.290">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="224.519" offset="1001409">That seems to be correct, yes, because the briefs, I think, were printed at the expense of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.066" offset="1039653">After respondent told the agent at the time that he wouldn't comply with the summons, so the United States and the special agent commenced this summons enforcement proceeding in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.131" offset="1083852">The District Court held a hearing, the transcript of which is set forth in the appendix, and briefly, the special agent testified as to the nature of the investigation, the purpose of the investigation, the necessity, the relevancy and the necessity for the handwriting exemplars, and he also testified that he had made no recommendation with respect to any criminal prosecution of respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.042" offset="1187506">There is no question in this case that the handwriting exemplars are relevant and necessary to completion of the Service's investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.003" offset="1223346">The District Court then ordered the summons enforced and ordered respondent to provide exemplars of eight different signatures, eight different signatures written out ten times each.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.436" offset="1277158">In fact, there's a particular form that the Service has for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.194" offset="1304116">On appeal, the Court of Appeals heard the case en bloc and reconsidered and thereafter overruled its prior decision in United States v. Campbell, that was a two to one panel decision which it upheld the Service's statutory right to, statutory authority to require the execution of these handwriting exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.603" offset="1401814">The opinions below are brief because the majority simply said, "We overrule Campbell and adopt the dissenting opinion in Campbell," and the dissent simply says I would follow Campbell.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.789" offset="1462523">The dissenting opinion of Campbell, in Campbell, is itself brief. Briefly, what it says is that it views the handwriting, process of requiring a handwriting exemplar as a search and seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and the dissenting judge went on in that case to say that those charged with investigation and prosecutorial duties should not be the sole judges of when to utilize what he called constitutionally sensitive means in pursuing their tasks.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.154" offset="1591986">There are two statutes involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.666" offset="1610062">We submit that the Court of Appeals erred in that there is statutory authority to require the execution of this handwriting exemplar.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.792" offset="1642559">The statutes are set forth in our appendix to our brief at page 1A and 2A, in the back of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.667" offset="1678085">Section 7601 is the so-called canvass power of the Internal Revenue Service which the Court has explored in many, many different decisions, most recently in the LaSalle National Bank and also in the Joe Doe summons case of several terms ago, United States v. Bisceglia.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.776" offset="1758438">And this sort of charges the Secretary of the Treasury and his delegate, the Commissioner, to cause officers to proceed throughout each district and inquire after and concerning all persons therein who may be liable to pay any internal revenues tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.392" offset="1824893">Section 7602, the immediately succeeding section, is the summons authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.964" offset="1855195">I would direct the Court's attention to Subparagraph 2 of that, which gives the Secretary or his delegate the authority to summon the person liable for a tax, and if I can just move over to page 2A, to appear before the Secretary or his delegate at a time and place named in the summons and to product such books, papers, records and other data, and to give such testimony under oath as may be relevant or material to such inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.134" offset="1967940">And the third subparagraph empowers the officer of the Internal Revenue Service to take such testimony of the person concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.920" offset="2003048">We believe that the compulsory process authority set forth in the statute to require a person to appear and to give such testimony as may be relevant reasonably carries with it the statutory authority to compel a witness to exhibit certain specific physical characteristics, such as handwriting or voice exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.286" offset="2104508">This proposition we think has been well established, not only by decisions of this Court but by the pertinent authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.290" offset="2144528">Well, what you're arguing is basically a statutory question, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="514.113" offset="2159783">Certainly Mara and Dionisio establish that if Congress says so, there is no constitutional objection.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.544" offset="2185592">Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.014" offset="2187473">And I think that Mara and Dionisio to the extent are relevant here, really refute the dissenting judge in Campbell's view that there was some kind of constitutionally sensitive thing, either from the Fifth Amendment point of view or the Fourth Amendment point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.122" offset="2251839">I mean, I think it's established that this is not testimonial compulsion, and that it's also established that exhibiting, you know, that requiring someone to give a voice exemplar, show his face, give fingerprints or whatever, is not a search and seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.230" offset="2316309">So I don't think there's any really constitutional question.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.538" offset="2333550">Mr. Smith, is your argument then, you are not arguing that the handwriting exemplar is testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.345" offset="2356746">In fact, I guess it's not testimony under this --</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="568.914" offset="2379003">Testimony; right, exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.253" offset="2392377">Given the statutory power to take testimony of a non-privileged nature, since these non-testimonial acts are non-privileged as established by decisions of this Court, that that statutory authority is reasonably inherent in the authority to compel somebody to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.430" offset="2481089">Because if you -- in other words, if you can compel somebody to appear before a revenue agent and let's say the Revenue agent, let's say in this particular case -- or take the case of Bisceglia, where somebody had made a large deposit to to a bank, the Service had a teller who thought he could identify the person, and there was a suspicion that it was the person under investigation, if he were brought in, quote, "to appear," the Revenue agent could say to the teller, "Is this the fellow who deposited the 400 one hundred dollar bills," or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.772" offset="2642422">It's that, exhibition of his face, which is inherent in the statutory authority to compel somebody to appear.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="641.735" stopTime="645.365">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="641.735" offset="2670320">You don't really claim, then, that the literal wording of the statute covers this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="645.365" stopTime="920.742">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="645.365" offset="2684844">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.694" offset="2686098">I don't think there's any question that the literal wording doesn't cover this case, but we think that given the recent decision of law construing the statutory authority in a broad way to enhance the Service's power to find out information and to discharge its canvass duty, to go around and to find out who owes tax, that this is a reasonable construction of the statute, and it doesn't offend any constitutional concerns, and there really is no policy reason to construe the statute in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.388" offset="2848893">For example, I think one of the things that I think is germane is, the Court observed in Bisceglia that had the taxpayer or the bank official in that case been called before a grand jury, there wouldn't be any question that the grand jury could compel the bank official to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.520" offset="2937501">And the court analogized the Service summons authority to the grand jury authority to seek information.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.442" offset="2977102">We don't think that there really is -- we think that analogy coupled with the statutory language which we think is hospitable to our construction more or less carries the day and demonstrates the error of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.443" offset="3033109">Because here again, had the respondent been called before a grand jury, there's no question that he would have to make these handwriting exemplars, and the protections, one of the arguments that is made is well, you know, he doesn't have any protections in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.862" offset="3086817">Somehow there is a -- this is being decided by an Internal Revenue officer that he has to do this, and that he doesn't have any protections of the neutral officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.239" offset="3132374">But I think it's well established that the whole summons enforcement mechanism is replete with protections, not only of a statutory nature, but the protections established by the decisions of this Court, decisions like Donaldson and Powell, which more or less indicate that, you know, that more or less say, without any question, that a summons from the Internal Revenue Service is not self-executing, that person can object to its enforcement, as indeed respondent did in this case, and that you have the interposition of the Federal judiciary to determine whether the summons is over-broad and a variety of questions which courts determine every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.599" offset="3317739">In fact, you have the full adversary proceeding which enables a person to object to particular questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.199" offset="3352116">In fact, you have the right to appear with counsel when you go to comply with the summons, which you don't have in the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.964" offset="3387225">I think, you know, it more or less demonstrates to us the truth of the court's observation in Bisceglia that Congress has provided protection from arbitrary or capricious action by placing the federal courts between the government and the person summoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.384" offset="3448874">So that the analogy between the Internal Revenue Service summons and the grand jury subpoena we think is sound and provides all the necessary, and the decisions of this court provide all the necessary protections in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.658" offset="3506030">We don't see really that there's any real problem either from a constitutional or a statutory nature with construing the statute in a way to provide giving these handwriting exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.430" offset="3561096">I simply say, and I simply address another point of objection which we think is really without force, is the fact that the court below felt somehow that the Service has no authority to force somebody to create things; in other words, that somehow you can get a piece of paper or, you know, books and records, but you can't say to somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.784" offset="3658480">"Okay, come in and create something for us."</text>
            <text syncTime="892.574" offset="3673631">But, I mean, it seems to us there are really two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.190" offset="3692126">You are not really asking anybody to create something when you ask them to provide handwriting exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.565" offset="3721592">All you're really doing is asking them to display physical characteristic, much the same way that when you take someone's photograph, you're not creating their face, or if you record their fingerprints, you're not creating their fingerprints.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.602" offset="3773733">All you're doing is recording a physical characteristic.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.362" offset="6812818">My name is James Erwin, counsel for the respondent Harvey F. Euge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.521" offset="6833507">The issue in this case is whether the Congress has authorized the use of an administrative summons to compel the creation of physical or real evidence, in this particular case handwriting exemplars, in the administrative investigation of tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.178" offset="6900067">We submit that there is nothing in the text of the statute, in its legislative history or in the antecedents of the statute to which the legislative history makes reference which supports that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.390" offset="6948968">The government relies upon two words or phrases that appear in the statute, the first of which is "appear."</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.877" offset="6974882">The power to compel a person to appear and give testimony, or compel a person to appear and produce books, papers, records, and other data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.700" offset="7006124">We believe that the word "appear" merely has reference to compelling a person to respond to the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.927" offset="7039039">This is in accord with the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.556" offset="7053563">The agent who issues a summons is conducting a tax investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.242" offset="7072371">Therefore there is no such thing as a default in the ordinary case of where monetary or equitable relief, he needs to have a response.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.583" offset="7105703">A person must either comply with the summons or he must appear and make whatever good faith defense he may have to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.134" offset="7151888">The statutory structure is likewise set up in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.678" offset="7170069">Section 7604(b), to which this Court had reference in the Kaplan case in 1964, noted that it was only for the use of a person wholly defaulted or contumaciously refused to comply with the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.962" offset="7227225">In fact, this was a procedure that was followed in this case in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.780" offset="7246451">Mr. Euge initially failed to appear before the revenue agent in response to the summons and he initially failed to appear before the District Court in response to an order to show cause, and an attachment for his arrest was issued under section 7604(b) and he was brought before the court and the case eventually proceeded to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.091" offset="7331715">Incidentally, at the time that he was brought before the court, there was a hearing held on his financial ability to retain counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2583.448" offset="10437151">Do you feel there are no implications in that decision that are adverse to your position here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.356" offset="10464841">You cite it only twice, once to the dissenting opinion and once to the ensuing curative legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2598.696" offset="10498173">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.016" offset="10507473">Well, there is a suggestion that the grand jury analogy, which Mr. Smith has made reference to, is complete in this type of case, that the Congress intended to give to the internal revenue agent the same power that the grand jury has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.395" offset="10568913">I believe that that is not correct, that the grand jury and the internal revenue agent stand on different footing, and while the analogy does have force in certain situations, it does not have force in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.369" offset="10640802">First of all, a grand jury, as was pointed out in the dissenting opinion in that case, is a creature of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.288" offset="10672567">The Internal Revenue Service is a statutory body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.804" offset="10686568">It does not have inherent power as a grand jury does to compel the production of all types of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2697.060" offset="10891577">The functions of the grand jury are not the same as the special agent's function, as the agent of the Internal Revenue Service.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2706.948" offset="10931179">You are saying that somehow the guarantee that Justice Stewart has commented upon, upon the right of every person to be indicted by a grand jury constitutionalizes the right of the grand jury in a way that favors the government over an act of Congress which authorizes the service to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.860" offset="11034833">Is that what you mean?</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Erwin</label>
            <text syncTime="2734.315" offset="11040684">Well, what I am saying is that the grand jury has inherent power such as the court does in a pending criminal case to order the production of this type of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.766" offset="11082480">As contrasted to the power of the Internal Revenue Service, which is statutory, and if the statute does not provide for that power, no matter how much they would like to have it or might need it, they do not have it, and that is the point I am trying to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.592" offset="11153742">I would further point out that the grand jury has two functions historically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.696" offset="11190105">One is the investigative function which the agent of the Internal Revenue Service also has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.003" offset="11211421">The other is to function as a protection of citizens of the prosecutorial arm of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.315" offset="11244648">This is not something that is shared by the agent of the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.657" offset="11265964">True, the Internal Revenue Service does not actually prosecute the case if it comes to trial, but certainly they are aligned with the prosecution and they investigate, prepare the case and make recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.800" offset="11314552">Frequently agents or other employees of the Internal Revenue Service participate in grand jury proceedings for technical assistance and they frequently provide expert witnesses at a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.601" offset="11393755">Finally, there is no neutral supervision of the issuance of a summons prior to its issuance except in very limited cases as set forth in section 7609.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.067" offset="11447672">There is supervision if the taxpayer objects, in which case it goes to the District Court and the matter is reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.539" offset="11477556">It appears that this does not occur very often.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.567" offset="11489677">Taking the government's statistics from their briefs, in an 18-month period ending in December '78, it said that handwriting exemplars were used in 320 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.383" offset="11532936">Our research has turned up only about 10 cases reported and unreported in which the use of a summons was reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.260" offset="11564387">So it is less than five percent of the cases have reviewed the use of summons for handwriting exemplars, and this is in a situation where there is enough doubt about whether the Internal Revenue Service even has the power that is required for resolution by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.047" offset="11715584">It may be that the experience of the Internal Revenue Service is such that it has revealed the need to be able to use administrative summons to obtain handwriting exemplars or voice exemplars or perhaps in exceptional cases fingerprints, I believe even blood samples were mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.462" offset="11793220">But it is our position that the present statute does not authorize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.560" offset="11809625">It is an old statute that goes back many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.662" offset="11826030">There was an existing practice at the time that the present statute was enacted, a practice that had been in existence since the 19th Century for the production of documentary evidence, which is the usual type of evidence used in a tax case, whether civil or criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.820" offset="11902621">It may be that the statute to that extent was obsolete and it needs changing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2958.575" offset="11937625">Yes, and because they were presently in existence and they made reference to the Brown case and said that it only applied to documents which were presently in existence and agreed with that position of the Brown case which relied primarily on canons of statutory construction which is essentially what we have been arguing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.654" offset="12061968">But it did not say that they had the power to compel the production of documents or lists or summaries which did not exist at the time the summons was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.522" offset="12101465">Indeed, I think this case made that limitation for third party summons which uses the same language as section 7602 when directed towards a third party record-keeper to require them not to just turn over what records they may have to the Internal Revenue Service, but to prepare lists or summaries of analyses and so forth presently not having to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.202" offset="12228211">If the service needs the power to compel the execution of handwriting exemplars or to compel the production of other real or physical evidence, we believe that the appropriate forum for addressing that is Congress which, after all, is the body which has enacted the statute and given them power to issue the summons in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.028" offset="12311489">It is our position that the summons power should not be enlarged by this Court under the guise of statutory construction to include within its scope that which Congress has excluded, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>
