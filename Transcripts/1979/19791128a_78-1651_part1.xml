            <text syncTime="75.573" offset="405713">The Petitioners, Polk and Seatrain, were signatories to a contract entered into in June of 1972 with the Secretary of Commerce, whereby $27.2 million in subsidy was provided towards the construction of the Supertanker Stuyvesant.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.981" offset="475303">The issue that this case presents involves whether the Secretary of Commerce has the power, under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, to amend that contract to delete there from certain terms restrec -- certain terms restricting the domestic trade by the Stuyvesant in exchange for a repayment of the subsidy awarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.677" offset="710092">What happened was there was a remand of the particular exercise of this authority in the case of the Stuyvesant for further consideration by the Secretary and prior to the decision on remand, the Plaintiffs here, Shell and Alaska Bulk, took appeal of the issue of authority to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals, in split decision, decided the Secretary did not enjoy the authority under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.517" offset="805491">The Stuyvesant, Your Honor, may it please the Court, had the benefit of and participation by the Secretary of Commerce directly and indirectly in its construction financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.308" offset="844570">The Secretary had a loaned out right under the Economic Development Administration Act, $5 million and guaranteed 90% of other $80 million in loans which were used to refurbish the shipyard, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the vessels were built.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.336" offset="912697">This was part of a program to both establish a shipyard for use in national purposes and, also, to employ the hardcore unemployed in that area and provide them job training.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.661" offset="1242049">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.423" offset="1253021">Although I am also prepared to discuss the merits of this case, I would address myself primarily to the jurisdiction presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.115" offset="1279875">Plaintiffs' complaint asserted that the Stuyvesant transaction which is at issue here was unlawful for essentially three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.118" offset="1311848">First is that the Secretary lacked power to enter into such transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.546" offset="1329507">The second is that, given the circumstances of this case, the Secretary had abused her discretion by entering into the transaction, for failing to consider the economic impact on the existing domestic traders in the Alaskan trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.305" offset="1388544">Third, they challenge the nature of the proceedings in the -- before the Secretary, under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.199" offset="1420204">On November 22, 1977, the District Court concluded that the Secretary had power to enter into a Stuyvesant type of transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.481" offset="1457298">He concluded, however, that the Secretary had abused her discretion by failing to consider the economic impact issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.909" offset="1486973">The District Court, therefore, granted partial summary judgment to both sides and remanded the case to the Secretary for determination within 45 days of the economic impact issue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="381.484" offset="1629288">That's made quite clear by this Court's decision in Wetzel, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.000" offset="1655411">The court also concluded on November 22nd, the District Court, that the third issue, the procedural claim, would require a trial and, therefore, did not grant summary judgment either way on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.215" offset="1704208">On November 30th, Plaintiffs, the Respondents here who I'll refer to as Plaintiffs since we're also technically Respondents, went before the court and asked them to modify the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.753" offset="1746422">First, they voluntarily dismissed their procedural claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.227" offset="1760319">Second, they first asked the court to enter a certification under 28 U.S.C., 1292 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="422.535" offset="1793546">That provision, in our view, is the only provision which would have allowed an interlocutory appeal on the statutory power question.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.070" offset="1823640">The District Court, however, intimated that it was not -- it didn't think that was appropriate or it didn't think it was necessary and it agreed to accept the Plaintiffs' second suggestion, which was that it enter a certification under Rule 54 (b) to allow an immediate appeal of the statutory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.248" offset="1904410">At that point, Petitioners -- the Plaintiffs appealed, although the Secretary had never had a chance to render its decision on the remand on that point, and although the District Court has never had a chance to address the remand decision which came down while the appeal was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.009" offset="1971388">We submit that that appeal was premature and the Court of Appeals lacked power to hear this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.976" offset="1995316">Primary submission of plaintiffs as to why jurisdiction iss -- existed in the Court of Appeals is that the November 30th order constituted a valid Rule 54 (b) certification, that's the question of the Secretary's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.020" offset="2051427">Rule 54 (b) permits the District Court to enter a final judgment as to any separate claim for relief even though the litigation as a whole is not terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.890" offset="2090924">For example, in this case, suppose the Plaintiffs had sued the Secretary regarding the Stuyvesant transaction and, in addition, had sued the Secretary for a subsidy that they claim was due them on some other unrelated transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.389" offset="2148916">If the Secretary, excuse me, if the District Court, during the course of that litigation, had concluded that the Secretary did not owe them the subsidy and finally determine that separate claim and then -- but then, there were further proceedings to be had on the Stuyvesant claim, then the District Court, in our view, would have had the power to enter a Rule 54 (b) certification because, then, a certification would have been finally determined and that's what Rule 54 (b) exists to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.890" offset="2258944">That, however, in our view, is not what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.619" offset="2273886">Before I turn to that, I would like to say at the outset that the standard of review of the 54 (b) requests in -- depends on what is being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.796" offset="2314533">If the question involves whether or not the District Court should have exercised its discretion as to a clearly separate claim, then this court's decision in Sears, Roebuck against Mackey and other decisions make clear that there's an abusive discretion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.098" offset="2371793">However, the Court's subsequent decision in Liberty Mutual Insurance Company against Wetzel makes it clear that where the question is simply whether or not there are separate claims, they can be certified under Rule 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="580.553" offset="2425605">That is purely a legal question and there's no deference due.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.599" offset="2445772">In our view, what happened here is that the Plaintiffs had two interrelated legal theories supporting a legal right, and such interrelated legal theories do not constitute separate claims within the purview of Rule 54 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.788" offset="4618533">That's exact-- absolutely correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and as an institutional litigant, the United States has a very great interest in making sure that the final judgment rule is adhered to, if at all possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.125" offset="4667852">I mean, the United States is involved in many remand decisions and, as a general rule, the Courts of Appeals have recognized, including an opinion by Mr. Justice Blackmun when he was on the Eighth Circuit that a remand decision is not final judgment for purposes of 1291, and we don't think there's any reason to distinguish from that rule in this case.</text>
