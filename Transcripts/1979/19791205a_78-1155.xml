            <text syncTime="11.789" offset="150549">As the Court is well aware, this case was here and extensively argued about a year and a half ago, at which time it was returned back to a three-judge district court on the question of mootness, because the -- Mr. Jones at that time had been paroled to a mental -- VA mental hospital in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.060" offset="247620">The three-judge court found that the case was not moot because his parole could be violated--revoked at any time, and he might be returned back to the penitentiary at Nebraska, where he would be subjected to the same possibility of being transferred to a state mental hospital.</text>

            <text syncTime="63.968" offset="359215">Shortly after that, about three months, I believe, he was found to have left--he violated it some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.195" offset="396204">But at any rate, the parole board violated his parole and put out a warrant for his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.173" offset="420028">And he was subsequently arrested in the State of Arizona, and returned to the penitentiary in Nebraska, where he now is incarcerated in the regular part of the penitentiary, as of this--as of Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.355" offset="484812">So they--we still have the same basic questions, I believe, that we argued here before, and that's really whether the statute in Nebraska authorizing transfer is constitutional or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.272" offset="1708492">I think the officials are naturally afraid to do anything because of the injunction, and because of the fact that two of the three judges are the same judges they're going to have any time a case comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.493" offset="1761364">So very briefly, then, I don't want to go over all of the ground we've gone over before.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.919" offset="1791039">I appreciate the Court's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.874" offset="1798875">And I only want to emphasize a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.580" offset="1813713">And that is, that the transfer, according to statute, is not just for treatment, but is for examination and study.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.143" offset="1851956">And then treatment, if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.962" offset="1859271">The statute provides that when treatment -- when treatment is no longer necessary, an inmate shall be transferred back to the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.862" offset="1886856">So the first thing I want to emphasize is that it's merely a question of sending someone over to a private--or to a mental hospital, the same as civilians go to for examination and study.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.843" offset="1938787">The second thing I would like to emphasize is there there's no issue in this case on the constitutional quality of the conditions at this hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.739" offset="1978284">This has never been raised in the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.934" offset="1991137">The state has not presented any evidence on whether or not the kind of treatment is adequate or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.324" offset="2016632">And we think it would be a much better procedure to attack this place, if they think it's bad, on the constitutional quality, rather than on the method of getting over there.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.185" offset="2060100">And these are points which we went into quite extensively before, and I don't think there's any need to go into them again, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.579" offset="2085700">So with that, I'll end.</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.547" offset="9597576">That fundamental right, or the right that is given to you because there's an expectation given to you by state law, would exist one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.685" offset="9638118">I think what I'm saying is that the stigma, when you go into a small town, might be more felt in a small town than it would be in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.141" offset="9675943">Because in a town of 5,000 people, everyone knows you came from the Nebraska State Hospital.</text>

            <text syncTime="2417.319" offset="9772596">I think in Mr. Jones case, the plaintiff here, he felt that it had -- he didn't want to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.695" offset="9802167">It was probably much more of a stigma to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.962" offset="9811257">And it could be to some prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.669" offset="9818049">I'm not saying that might not be a stigma to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.778" offset="9830484">In fact, some prisoners may in fact want to be at a state mental hospital as opposed to the penal complex for certain reasons, for security or for whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.266" offset="9872488">I would also just like to say -- talk a moment about the right to counsel which this -- the three -- judge court found should exist, if in fact the prisoner is given some type of hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.227" offset="9932257">It would appear to me that if we do find, and I think we should find, that the prisoner does have a fundamental right to a hearing before he's transferred to the mental hospital, if he can't afford a lawyer, he really ought to have a lawyer appointed for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.589" offset="9993697">It's analogous to the parens patria theory that, as in the juvenile proceedings, that if the state is going to take this person under their wing and take care of him now because they have taken away some of his liberties, they really ought to take care of him and insure that throughout all of the proceedings that he is afforded counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.419" offset="10073004">Because as the lower court found, unless the prisoner really has -- or knows his rights, what good are the rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.339" offset="10100694">They're illusory.</text>
