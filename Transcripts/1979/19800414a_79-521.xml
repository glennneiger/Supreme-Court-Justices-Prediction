            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="14.864" offset="162879">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.941" offset="175104">This case concerns the relationship between the Freedom of Information Act and Section 6 (b) (1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.761" offset="210422">The case is here because two Federal Courts of Appeals have disagreed over the way in which the two statutes should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.905" offset="243022">The Second Circuit in Pierce &amp; Stevens Chemical Corporation against the Consumer Product Safety Commission adopted the Commissions view that Section 6 (b) (1) does not apply when the Commission responds to an FOIA request.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.350" offset="300805">Four months later in the present case, the Third Circuit reached the contrary result.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.241" offset="324315">The Commission petitioned for certiorari to resolve the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.084" offset="343751">And the facts here are straight forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.986" offset="351274">In March of 1974, the Commission published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the time and place of a public hearing to discuss television receivers' safety with emphasis on shock and fire hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.599" offset="417729">The notice asked manufacturers to submit a variety of information concerning television safety including all TV related accident reports collected since 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.744" offset="470392">When the manufacturers' response to this informal request proved unsatisfactory, the Commission sought to obtain the same materials through the special order and subpoena procedures provided in Section 27 (b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.454" offset="533191">Eventually, television manufacturers submitted a large volume of information to the Commission, the vast majority of which consisted of TV accident data.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.661" offset="578017">The Commission received more than 7600 TV related accident reports concerning accidents occurring between 1969 and 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.514" offset="625455">And soon after the manufacturers began to submit their requested materials, Consumers Union of the United States and Public Citizen's Health Research Group filed FOIA request to inspect and copy the information submitted including the TV accident reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.924" offset="695045">In response to those requests, the Commission made available all of the materials submitted by the manufacturers as to which no claim of confidentiality had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.261" offset="740394">The Commission then notified the manufacturers of the outstanding FOIA requests and asked them to substantiate the earlier claims of confidentiality that they had made at the time they submitted the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.246" offset="792325">The manufacturers responded by asserting that the accident reports and some other materials were exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA, under Exemption 4, the so-called “trade secret exemption” and Exemption 7, the exemption for investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.165" offset="876022">They also asserted that some of the material including some of the material within the accident reports could not be released because to release it would be to violate the criminal provisions of the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.189" offset="940178">The Commission then reviewed the accident reports and the manufacturers' submissions on confidentiality and determined that the bulk of the material was not exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.850" offset="990751">The Commission notified the manufacturers of its determination and told them they would withhold three categories of information, accident data that identified the name and address of an accident victim or included other personal information, the release of which might result in an invasion of privacy, accident data in the form of legal material such as legal memoranda and correspondents with an attorney privilege because of the attorney-client relationship or the attorney work product doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.056" offset="1107571">And finally, technical data that the submitting company had kept secret and the release of which might have caused substantial harm to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.300" offset="1144560">The Commission also informed the manufacturers that because of the apparent variations in the way the manufacturers had maintained their accident records over the years between 1969 and 1974 that the release of those records under the FOIA would be accompanied by a statement to the effect that because of the variations, some of the data could be misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.926" offset="1243094">Now, there's never been any dispute in this litigation about anything but the accident reports, because in May 1975, the requesters agreed to limit their request to those reports, edited to eliminate the personal information about the accident victims and the legal materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.810" offset="1314565">After the Commission announced this decision, respondents, who are 12 of the affected to television manufacturers, filed separate lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and three other District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.272" offset="1364511">All 12 suits were eventually consolidated in the District of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.540" offset="1381543">In addition to their -- repeating their contentions regarding the FOIA exemptions in the Trade Secrets Act, respondents, for the first time, alleged that the Commission's proposed release of the accident reports would violate Section 6 (b) (1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.401" offset="1448939">The District Court accepted this argument and permanently enjoined the Commission from releasing the materials without complying with the procedural requirements of Section 6 (b) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="346.991" offset="1491362">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, rejecting the analysis of the Second Circuit in Pierce &amp; Stevens Chemical Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.180" offset="1524067">Now, because both Courts have -- have decided this case in reliance of Section 6 (b) (1), neither has ever addressed the allegations by respondents that the accident reports are exempt from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.181" offset="1588120">So the case comes to the Court in a posture that disclosure is required under the FOAI, unless respondents are correct about the proper interpretation of Section 6 (b) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="383.635" offset="1637961">Now, Section 6 (b) (1) applies to public disclosures of information by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.279" offset="1664502">The statute provides that when the Commission proposes to make a public disclosure of information.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="413.972" offset="1759274">Now, the statute provides that when the Commission proposes to release information from which the public could readily ascertain the identity of a particular consumer product and the manufacturer or a labeler of that product, the Commission must follow four procedural rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.802" offset="1826565">The first one, is that the Commission must notify the affected manufacture, must provide him with the summary of the information to be disclosed, and it must afford him a reasonable opportunity to comment on that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.315" offset="1884662">The second requirement is that the Commission must take reasonable steps to assure the accuracy of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.116" offset="1911829">The third requirement is that the Commission must take reasonable steps to ensure that disclosure would be fair under the circumstances and reasonably related to effectuating the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.797" offset="1962611">And the fourth requirement is that if the Commission discovers after a disclosure had been made, that some of the information disclosed is inaccurate or misleading, it must publish a retraction “in a manner similar to that in which the original disclosure was made.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="482.013" offset="2031470">Are you referring now, Mr. Buscemi to the language of 6 (b) (1) itself or to the regulation?</text>

            <text syncTime="488.634" offset="2057906">Language of 6 (b) (1) itself, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.672" offset="2074102">Now, the Commission's position is that these four requirements of Section 6 (b) (1) did not apply when the Commission responds to and FOIA request.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.255" offset="2112345">Stated it in a different way, the Commission believes that Congress did not intend the phrase “public disclosures of information” under Section 6 (b) (1) to include releases of information in response to the mandatory disclosure provisions of the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.287" offset="2184547">The Commission arrived that this interpretation of the statute that it administers for three principle reasons that I'd like to discuss in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.193" offset="2216103">The first one --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="529.465" offset="2221223">Before you get to that, you concede that this interpretation is one of the so-called Skidmore versus Swift &amp; Company-type of interpretations where the Commission has not been granted the authority to fill in blanks.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.705" offset="2282141">It's simply a -- an interpretation by the agency charged with the administration of the statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="551.604" stopTime="569.050">
            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="551.604" offset="2309831">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.009" offset="2311398">And the Commission was confronted with the situation in which it had to decide -- it receives many FOIA request and it therefore had to decide whether or not, and if so how Section 6 (b) (1) applied in that context, so it was necessarily required to make this kind of interpretation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="569.050" stopTime="606.155">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="569.050" offset="2379525">But it -- it's not as if the -- if Congress had authorized the Commission to define particular items or to make rules and regulations pertaining to disclosure which would have taken it outside of the Swift and Skidmore type of regulation and into the -- simply, is it rational type of thing where you -- which you frequently find where Congress has left the Commission to the -- left the Commission the job of filling in blanks which it didn't want to fill itself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="606.155" stopTime="800.851">
            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="606.155" offset="2528005">No, I think the critical consider -- consideration here is Congressional intent, although the Commission is certainly authorized to promulgate regulations to explain how it's going to interpret and apply the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.135" offset="2575862">Now, the -- the first of the principal reasons or the set of reasons that I want to discuss are the contrasting structure and purpose of the Consumer Product Safety Act on the one hand, and the Freedom of Information Act on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.696" offset="2630196">Now, when Congress we used the phrase “public disclosure of information” in Section 6 of the Consumer Product Safety Act, it was referring to the sorts of affirmative disclosures made at the Commission's initiative and with the Commission's endorsement that are mandated elsewhere in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.644" offset="2701981">The Act taken as a whole makes clear, and respondents have never disputed that the primary function assigned to the Commission by statute is the collection, analysis, and dissemination of consumer product safety information.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.315" offset="2756629">We've listed in our brief at pages 15 to 17, a number of the Act's provisions that direct the Commission to make public disclosures or to require such disclosures by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.896" offset="2798947">The most important example of those provision is Section 5 (a) (1) of the Act which directs the Commission to maintain an injury information clearing house, to collect, investigate, analyze, and distribute injury data and information relating to the causes of death, injury, and illness associated with consumer products.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.365" offset="2880867">The Commission is, thus under a statutory obligation to investigate possible safety hazards and to disclose the results of its investigations even if no one ever asks for those results.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.985" offset="2927261">And Section 6 of the Act follows immediately after Section 5, and the Commission believes that even the placement of the two sections in the statute supports its view that the public disclosures of information to which Section 6 refers are those undertaken by the Commission in the performance of it's statutory duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.517" offset="3005419">This interpretation makes sense, in light of the purpose of the Consumer Product Safety Act, which is to educate the public with respect to product safety hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.386" offset="3052962">When the Commission makes a public disclosure of the kind described in the Act, it wants and expects the consuming public to trust the accuracy of the information disclosed and to rely on it in making purchasing decisions with respect to consumer products.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.253" offset="3124433">The protections required by 6 (b) (1) fit perfectly in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.701" offset="3142196">Indeed, the statute was designed, specifically, to protect against the harm that a manufacturer might suffer, if the Commission, through its weight behind a public disclosure of information that reflected adversely on a particular product and that subsequently proved to be erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.217" offset="3212204">That was the danger that Congressman Crane stressed on the House floor in his discussion of the FTC's treatment of Zerex antifreeze that we reprint in the brief at pages 34 to 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.434" offset="3257135">And it was the danger against the rep -- against which the representative of respondent, General Electric Company, warned when he testified at the House Subcommittee hearing on the consumer product safety legislation that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1905.673" offset="7726059">Let me take an example, suppose the New York Times comes to the Commission and says, “Give us this material,” and the Commission gives it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.839" offset="7758764">Instead the New York Times goes under the federal FOIA and asks for the information.</text>

            <text syncTime="1987.941" offset="8055097">In Pierce &amp; Stevens, Judge Feinberg expressly contrasted the industrial nature of the supplier and the single person character of the requester who had a very appealing case, Your Honors, and who came to the Commission with not information supplied by others but as a woman who had suffered, her house completely burning down, herself being injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.336" offset="8180694">And an examination by the agency itself and she said, “Can I have the result to that -- that examination?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.131" offset="8207862">It was a rather easy case and Judge Feinberg said, “Well, when you have all of these industrials and a person asks for it, isn't it fair to give it to the person?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.516" offset="8249448">I think he lost sight of the fact that most often -- by the way, it is not individuals who go to the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.774" offset="8278497">It's of course industry, it's of course the press, it's of course interested parties, it's of course consumer groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.012" offset="8307440">And as the Chief Justice pointed out to say that it has an imprimatur if it comes directly from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.420" offset="8357073">But it has no imprimatur if it goes through the FOIA even though the Commission hasn't the right to say, “You must say it comes through the FOIA.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.001" offset="8391346">It's in my mind Your Honors simply to state the fact that beggars belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.251" offset="8432410">Now, as to why it was that Section (6) (b) (1) was put into this particular statute, I must say to Your Honors that sometimes, doubting the wisdom of Congress as some of us do perhaps unwisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.073" offset="8507643">This was one time when it acted with a great statesmanship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.007" offset="8551424">The Commission foresaw that it would require for its particular assignment, it must remember, if it please the Court, that this came in 1972 when consumerism was enveloping the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.256" offset="8632404">And this was an endeavor and the biggest thing the consumers were asking, “Protect the consumer,” by the Congress to answer that persistent demand hammering at its doors with representatives, crowding its galleries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.298" offset="8708577">And the House Report, the Commission studiously avoids going into the legislative history and as our brief discloses and obviously, I won't have time to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2513.094" offset="10155760">Public information, identical.</text>

            <text syncTime="2521.372" offset="10188884">Public disclosure of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.064" offset="10199646">The Act use identical information how they can argue that one applies and the other doesn't, really is a -- certainly beyond the language of the Act, certainly beyond the legislative history of the Act and that's categorical on our brief, again and again quotes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.310" offset="10308629">And except for having quoted to Your Honors what I think is the most important, I will not quote the legislative history any longer in the interest of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.149" offset="10347917">The problem here is the interaction of two statutes, and a kind of endeavor to have the philosophies differentiated by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.845" offset="10410715">In the first place, that can't be done because of the clear language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.680" offset="10430046">Your Honors, all these words that have been used by my friend, this word “affirmative” that appears nowhere in the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.301" offset="10464528">The evidence of exclusivity appears nowhere in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.364" offset="10480828">His whole argument is because Congress hasn't introduced the Section 6 (b) (1) in the Federal Trade Commission Act, how can there be a Section 6 (b) (1) in this Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.985" offset="10523355">Well it's there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.360" offset="10528789">And why that Congress did it is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.079" offset="10543731">And I might say to Your Honors that in my judgment if the Federal Trade Commission Act had been passed under the same pressures of the consumers that this was and there had been the same knowledge that that's the way they get the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.363" offset="10600782">I'm a practicing lawyer as Your Honors know and let me tell you, if not for Section 6 (b) (1), when RCAS are advise, and we said, “Give them everything you want.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.884" offset="10646862">We would've said, “Give them nothing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.755" offset="10658356">Then what would've happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.569" offset="10665671">Years of litigation would've been sued and years of litigation would've been sued as to every endeavor by the Commission and that's what Congress recognized in its wisdom and that's what was avoided here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.603" offset="10717811">They got this -- they got really everything in the files of RCA pertaining to -- we didn't know what, pertains anything that relate -- remotely related to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.795" offset="10766503">Now, we could show if they are in conflict, rules of statutory construction, I could say to Your Honors the obvious since this is a 1972 Act, of course, it prevails over in 1966 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.751" offset="10842363">I could say to Your Honors since this is specific, it prevails over the general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.170" offset="10864097">But I have tried to give you what I regard as really a very much more basic underlying reason for this Act, because I do believe that the consumers are entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.399" offset="10920939">When you get into this kind of thing, first, they're entitled to a different kind of treatment than the Commission gave a whole subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.092" offset="10947688">They're entitled to deliberate consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.363" offset="10960854">The Commission can't now endeavor to remedy its errors by saying, “Well, there's no difference.We'll just ask for it through the FOIA and then everything will be cleared up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.300" offset="11000560">Don't worry about the fact that's deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.347" offset="11008711">Don't worry about its being a mélange of errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.824" offset="11018637">Don't worry about its being abysmally unfair to the manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.005" offset="11035355">Don't worry about how it could hurt a manufacturer who turned overall his files on the assumption that the Act meant what it said.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.178" offset="11068061">If the Commission hadn't done that, but had acted here deliberately and states them, why, we wouldn't be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.412" offset="11100975">And as I said earlier, we wouldn't be here, if it pleased the Court, if they had simply removed the names of the manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.430" offset="11137128">What use could that be since the Project Director said he had to say frankly that it would be no good for that purpose at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.161" offset="11175999">It couldn't be any good for comparisons among companies, then why will you give names of companies?</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.568" offset="11193657">Just the kind of abstinency, just the kind of adherence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.273" offset="11204420">Well, this is FOIA, so we're in the clear, we don't need to abide by even rules of decency.Now, the Pierce case, Your Honors, was a very compelling case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.132" offset="11243917">The Pierce case was a case in which a woman had had her house burned down, had been severely injured and she asked for the labels to see whether the label on her bottle was the same as the other labels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.861" offset="11350810">And the Commission advised her or the department advised her that there were questions about it, if it had an investigation but we have to go to the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.407" offset="11400965">Now, I suggest to Your Honors that if that case hadn't gone the way it did and the information had been supplied, no Court in the land would have undone or would have reversed that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.306" offset="11472645">And to show you how much Judge Feinberg's emphasis was on the incident and not the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.025" offset="11503470">I might say to Your Honors with the greatest of deference to accord of which I hold the highest regard, I'm sure if it rereads that opinion, it would not want its standing in the legal community to be determined by that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.042" offset="11555506">That simply doesn't address the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.751" offset="11566373">It simply doesn't address the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.077" offset="11575672">But to show you the unitary attitude, I just quote you one statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.414" offset="11605034">We believe that in this statute affecting only commercial enterprises, Congress did not intend to reduce disclosure called for by the FBI when a person requests documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.081" offset="11675669">Now, a person requested in that case, but the case applies if a corporation asked it, if an organization asked it, if the New York Times asks it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.508" offset="11733452">And somehow, the sympathy for the case, I'm afraid, overrode the kind of analysis and the kind of opinion that the Second Circuit has become admired for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.601" offset="11793742">Now, Your Honors, there's a great deal I could talk about concerning the language of the courts but I don't see any reason to take Your Honors' time unless there's a question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.340" offset="11900740">This case is purely a case of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.460" offset="11917249">Respondents have not replied to either of two points that the Commission relies on in both of its briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.912" offset="11947029">The first is, respondent has not explained why Congress would have decided to place a provision like Section 6 (b) (1) in the Consumer Product Safety Act but not in any other statute that in -- that creates an agency and empowers an agency to require private parties to produce information submitted to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.609" offset="12045772">All Government agencies are subject to the FOIA and that includes Government agencies created by statutes even after 1972 when there has this -- been this atmosphere of avoiding overregulation, Commodities Futures Trading Commission is just one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.490" offset="12109302">And there's no indication anywhere in respondents' argument or in brief, what the explanation would be for applying 6 (b) (1) to the Consumer Product Safety Commission alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.885" offset="12158934">Moreover, there's -- there's a second point where there's no explanation.</text>
