            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="70.969" offset="387218">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.098" offset="399757">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.084" offset="423685">It concerns the proper interpretation of the statutory provisions that guarantee certain reemployment rights to veterans upon their return to employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.775" offset="462451">These provisions are now codified in 38 U.S.C., 2021. The question here is how those provisions apply to the supplemental unemployment benefits or SUB's that are provided under the collective-bargaining agreement between respondent and the United Steel-workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.891" offset="534967">Specifically, the question is whether the guarantee against loss of seniority under the Act requires that the time spent by a veteran in the service be included in the time used to compute SUB's.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.310" offset="588570">SUB's are payments that are made by the employer to employees who have been laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.818" offset="610617">These payments are over and above the unemployment compensation that the employee otherwise receives from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.249" offset="640397">Under the SUB plan involved in this case, which is set out beginning at page 17 of the appendix, SUB payments are made on a weekly basis for a period of up to 52 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.507" offset="693373">That period depends upon the number of SUB credits that the employee has accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.615" offset="717824">The amount of each weekly payment is determined according to a formula set out in Section 1 of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.646" offset="745932">That formula depends on several factors, including the employee's present salary and his number of dependents and the amount of compensation that he receives from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.774" offset="790444">The formula does not depend on the amount of time that the employee has been employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.750" offset="810402">Therefore, there is no dispute in this case about the amount of each weekly benefit that was received by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.951" offset="843212">What the dispute in this case does concern, is the length of the time period over which this weekly SUB payments continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.864" offset="874872">This period is determined by the number of SUB credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.473" offset="889292">And these credits are earned through the passage of time as described in Section 2 of the SUB plan on page 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.511" offset="921370">One-half credit is earned per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.851" offset="934745">An eligible week for which 1/2 credit maybe on, is one and which the employee has any of the following hours; hours worked for the company, hours that are not worked but for which the employee is paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.812" offset="990647">For example, vacation time or time spend on jury duty and also, certain categories of hours not worked and for which the employee is not paid, where the employee is performing certain duties for the local union or as on a certain specified disability leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.868" offset="1066820">When an employee is laid off and receives weekly payments, he uses up the SUB credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.352" offset="1100779">Finally, under the plan an employee is not eligible to receive SUB payments at all, no matter how many credits he has accrued until he has two years of continuous service with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.984" offset="1155323">As an example of how the system works, if an employee begin work for the company and worked or engaged in time of these other eligible activities for continuous period the year and a half and was then laid off he would have accrued 39 SUB credits by that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.227" offset="1224286">That would be at the rate of 1/2 credit per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.120" offset="1235884">However, because he had not reached the 2-year eligibility threshold, he would not receive any SUB payments when he was laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.504" offset="1269426">In this case the petitioner began working for respondent in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.567" offset="1289592">And work for respondent for a period of four-and-half months during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.604" offset="1305788">He was then laid off and he then left respondent's employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.411" offset="1328985">He had accrued 9 SUB credits during the time that he was employed in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.761" offset="1350405">However, because he elected to leave respondent's employment those credits were canceled.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.030" offset="1375483">He then begun to work for respondent again in late January 1969 and continued to work for respondent until he entered military service in September of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.828" offset="1422712">He thus earned approximately 16 SUB periods, excuse me SUB credits during the slight of period.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.544" offset="1453537">He served in the military unit August 1971 when he was honorably discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.958" offset="1479241">He was the reinstated to this previous position with respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.903" offset="1495019">However, because of respondent's economic situation, he was immediately placed in layoff status.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.933" offset="1523127">He remained layoff for period of 9 1/2 months until July 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.805" offset="1550608">During the layoff period, petitioner received SUB payments for approximately 16 weeks, corresponding to the 16 SUB credits that he had earned before he entered the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.299" offset="1596583">However, he did not receive any payments for the remaining 5 1/2 months that the layoff continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.069" offset="1623646">Had petitioner not entered military service and continued in respondent's employment, the parties have stipulated that he would have 52 SUB credits at the time of his layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.407" offset="1668995">Thus, he would have received SUB credits for the, excuse me, SUB payments for the entire duration of his layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.266" offset="1696475">The question presented in this case then, is simply whether petitioner should have had his military service counted in determining his total SUB credits when he was reinstated following his military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.615" offset="1749870">Petitioner originally brought suit in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleging that the failure to consider his service time in computing his SUB credits violated his statutory rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.876" offset="1798875">The District Court rejected petitioner's contention, holding that the SUB plan established a bona fide work requirement for the earning of SUB credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.864" offset="1838791">Petitioner appealed and while the case was pending on appeal, this Court handed down its decision in Alabama Power Company v. Davis, holding that pension benefits or perquisite of seniority under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.856" offset="1890826">The Court of Appeals then vacated the District Court's decision and remanded for reconsideration in light of Alabama Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.379" offset="1920920">The District Court again held for respondent, stating that, “entitlement to SUB benefits requires more than continued status, such as a work requirement to any actual performance on the job”.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.547" offset="1977553">The Court of Appeals then affirmed for the reason stated by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.224" offset="2000227">The relevant provision of the statute involved here is that portion of 38 U.S.C 2021 (b) (1) that requires veterans to be reinstated without loss of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.851" offset="2050800">If this Court finds that SUB payments are perquisite of seniority within the meaning of that section then petitioner must be given credit for his army service time in computing his SUB credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.015" offset="2103463">That is a consequence of two main principles that were established in this Court's decision in Fishgold.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.948" offset="2131153">First, the escalator principle was established, that is that a veteran who returns to his employment is to be reinstated at the same place, he would have been had he remained in the employment, that is, at the place he would have been on the escalator, that he remained in employment not at the place he got off the escalator when he entered the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.094" offset="2215790">Secondly, Fishgold also established that the provisions of the act ought to be liberally construed for the benefit of the veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.406" offset="2249017">In this Court's decision in Alabama Power, it established the appropriate analysis for determining whether a particular benefit is indeed a perquisite of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.797" offset="2294575">The real nature of the benefit is to be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.018" offset="2307427">And it is to be determined whether other one hand the benefit is primarily in the nature of a reward for length of service in which case it is a perquisite of seniority or on the other hand whether the benefit is primarily short-term compensation for work performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.391" offset="2376913">Applying this test, severance pay and pension benefits have been held by this Court to be perquisites of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.621" offset="2405857">Vacation pay has been held to be primarily in the nature of compensation for work performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.492" offset="2433337">Before I turn to discussion of those factors that we believe indicate that SUB should be treated as a perquisite of seniority, I would like briefly to discuss the notion of a work requirement upon which the District Court and respondent have focused some of their attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.887" offset="2502928">There is no dispute here that SUB credits are primarily earn by employees who are workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.630" offset="2533857">This is naturally true of most benefits that this Court has dealt with whether they are determined by language in the collective-bargaining agreement that refers to work or whether that it is determined by language that refers use of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.788" offset="2594565">Now, in Alabama Power, a contention was made to this Court that any benefit that is determined by work requirement, that is where the collective-bargaining agreement specifies that most of the employees who earn the benefit will be working, should automatically dispose of any contention that the benefit maybe treated as a perquisite of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.268" offset="2684426">The Court expressly rejected that contention in Alabama Power and it noted that almost any benefit could be tied to a work requirement such as existed in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.676" offset="2726118">That would permit the employer himself to decide whether a benefit was a perquisite of seniority and the employer himself to decide whether the veteran was entitled to have his service time credited.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.774" offset="2774497">However, Congress has not left that decision up to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.428" offset="2793096">This is a decision that Congress has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.872" offset="2822875">Now, as far as the work requirement in this case, it is significantly less in the work requirement that this Court rejected in Alabama Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.805" offset="2862582">There, the question was whether the employee was entitled to accredited service time for the time that he spent in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.076" offset="2891630">Accredited service was defined in terms of full time service at 40 hours per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.801" offset="2918588">Moreover, the limited exceptions in Alabama Power, applied only to employees who are on paid leave not employees who are in certain categories of unpaid leave as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.161" offset="2971982">We believe that SUB benefits should be treated as a perquisite of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.148" offset="2996015">They serve a purpose that is akin to the most traditional seniority benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.665" offset="3018062">And this analysis incidentally was made by the Third Circuit in the Foster decision which was later affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.550" offset="3049618">The -- the primary purpose of SUB benefits is to protect employees against economic loss during periods of the diminished employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.155" offset="3087966">It acts as an adjunct to the normal layoff protection that employees get when they accrue seniority benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.476" offset="3117328">Thus when, there's an economic downturn and the employer is forced to layoff a number of employees, what happens, is those employees that have accrued the most amount of seniority are protected from layoff because of the seniority that they have accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.209" offset="3180231">Employees who have not accrued enough seniority to be protected from layoff get this more limited protection of the SUB benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.540" offset="3217533">That is they receive some money to tie them over the period for which they are unemployed and employees who have the least seniority at all will either not be eligible at all for SUB payments or they will receive less because they have accrued fewer credits.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="793.738" offset="3278346">All -- all employees laid off I take it will receive unemployment benefits from the State?</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="799.333" offset="3300707">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.018" offset="3303424">The SUBs are only intended to be a supplement to the unemployment benefits provided by the State and the formula for figuring out how much SUB is to be paid inclusive deduction for the amount of State on employment benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.405" offset="3360998">And in fact if an employee, for some reason, does not get State unemployment benefits for reason that was within his control if he doesn't apply for them for example, then he will not be eligible to receive SUBs.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.121" offset="3419826">We think the best analogy to the SUBs is a quite similar benefit of severance pay that this Court held to be a perquisite of seniority in the Accardi case.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.522" offset="3469458">Severance pay also provides income that ties an employee over a period of unemployment as to SUB's.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.615" offset="3497880">The difference essentially is that with SUB's layoff is only temporary and severance pay deals with the issue of permanent layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.996" offset="3539362">As in the Accardi the intent of SUB's, is to provide compensation for the lost of the rights and expectations that the employee has accrued over his period of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.009" offset="3591398">It is not to provide compensation for the work that the employee did in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.745" offset="3610311">The amount the SUB benefits as the amount of severance pay benefits are not at all tied to the amount of work that was done in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.034" offset="3647509">Moreover, the provisions of the plan are completely inconsistent with any notion that SUB's are to be treated as compensation for work performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.776" offset="3690454">First of all, SUB credits are forfeitable at anytime if the employee incurs a break in continuous service.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.018" offset="3719398">Therefore, an employee could work for 20 years and then if he incurred to break in service, he would loss all the SUB credit that he had accrued and if he hadn't been laid off in the time, he never would have received any benefit at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1183.401" offset="4837021">There is an entire section of the SUB plans, Section 4 that is devoted to the question of what benefits are paid when employee does not work 32 hours.</text>

            <text syncTime="1236.082" offset="5047672">It depends upon the number of dependents that he has, it depends upon his salary at the time of layoff, not at the time that the credits are earned and it depends on the amount of money in the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.981" offset="5095320">Now, in fact the -- the fact that it depends to some extent upon his salary at the time of layoff is an aspect of seniority, if anything in determining the amount for this payment – or these payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.743" offset="5142340">That was discussed by this Court in Alabama Power where as well it was noted at the pension benefits that were paid depended upon the employees compensation at the time that he was -- began to receive pension benefits not at the time that he earned the credits for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.246" offset="5212348">Finally, the specific points that this Court mentioned in Foster as indicating some sort of correlation between the amount of work and the amount of earning a credit are absent in this case. There are two factors that this Court mentioned in Foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.834" offset="5278699">First, that vacation benefit -- more vacation benefits were earned by employees who worked overtime, than employees who did not and there was a special provision that was made for overtime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.717" offset="5334288">Secondly, in Foster, employees who did not meet the minimum threshold, there you had to work 25 weeks per year in order to get a vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.354" offset="5368769">Employee -- certain employees who did not work 25 weeks per year were entitled to pro rata vacation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.121" offset="5531878">Now, what Section 4 of the agreement does is that it defines what's called the “short week benefit”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.930" offset="5559045">That is if an employee works 24 hours in a week, he is entitled to a benefit that he'll be paid as if he had worked 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.301" offset="5600528">But, and -- and the idea I think of that provision is probably -- it was probably put in mostly the instigation of the union is to encourage the employer to make sure that -- I should say to penalize the employer for not allowing employees to work 32 hours per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.346" offset="5660714">It acts as disincentive to the employer, to schedule employees for less than 32 hours per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.987" offset="5691329">Now, as far as how it fits into the SUB plan, an employee who works less than 32 hours per week does get half in SUB credit no matter how many hours he works he maybe eligible for a benefit under Section 4 of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.648" offset="5757994">Again he is not eligible for that benefit unless he's already got 2 years of service under his belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.344" offset="5788714">If he receives a benefit under Section 4, he would still accrue 1/2 SUB credit for that time but -- but because he's receiving a benefit he would also have to give up one SUB -- excuse me 1/2 SUB credit for that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.514" offset="5853393">So, he would end up in not accruing additional credits if he was actually receiving a benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.873" offset="5962898">Had he remained in a civilian employment, he would have had 52 SUB credits and would have received payments for an additional 22 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.698" offset="5994141">Having served in the military he was denied these payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.142" offset="6007933">We believe that this is precisely the result that Congress was intending to avoid when it passed the Veterans' Re-employment Rights Act statute and we submit that this Court should -- should hold that SUB benefits are perquisite of seniority and the petitioner was entitled to his credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.498" offset="6073344">If there are no further questions I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.504" offset="6605406">And I -- I don't think that that analysis would make this benefit or the vacation benefit in Foster a perquisite of seniority or it would make every benefit of perquisite of seniority --</text>

            <text syncTime="1722.220" offset="6992227">But once you have work in 2 years and accumulated 52 credit units not only increased seniority will not give a greater benefit, increase work won't give you a greater benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.391" offset="7044890">Further, the amount of the benefit represented by each credit unit also bears a reverse relationship to seniority if it bears any relationship to seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.896" offset="7094941">The plan provides that the amount of benefit that you'll receive in the event that you ever receive supplemental unemployment benefits is affected by four factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.782" offset="7142484">Number one, the wage rate of your job classification, that wage rate is established by the collective-bargaining agreement for each job classification and has nothing to do with seniority other than in the sense that in some jobs preference is a factor of seniority, and your ability to hold a particular job maybe depended upon seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.488" offset="7245302">But the actual wage rate for that job classification will be the same whether the individual holding that is a 2 year man or a 5-year man or a 10-year man or a 20-year man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.789" offset="7290546">The second factor in the amount to the benefit is the number of dependents that the employee has, obviously that has no relationship to seniority with the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.703" offset="7330147">The third factor in determining the amount of the benefit for each credit unit was the amount of state unemployment compensation which the employee receives from what ever state programs exists in that particular State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.320" offset="7388662">That has no involvement with sen -- with seniority and finally, the fourth factor that influences the amount of benefit is the amount of money remaining in the plan as whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.218" offset="7436204">The obligation if the industry is to fund the plan with a finite number of dollars agreed to in the collective-bargaining process then as the plan is exhausted through the layoffs once it reaches a sufficient diminution to key in that part of the formula, the amount of benefit represented by each credit unit drops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.014" offset="7535470">So that you actually have the anomalous situation if you're focusing on seniority that the 3-year man is much more likely to have his benefit be 100% of the possible benefit than the 20-year man because if a layoff in fact gets severe enough to reach the 20-year man, you'll likely to have the fund substantially depleted by the previous payments made to persons of lesser seniorities so that the 20 year man in fact finds he's getting a lesser benefit if his seniority number is in fact reached during the layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.409" offset="7688965">But we don't believe that that kind of a benefit should be classified to be a perquisite of seniority and indeed the -- the testimony in the record below is clear that it's -- it's not thought certainly by the industry and the by the people who negotiated it to be in any sense of perquisite of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.723" offset="7770258">Rather it is based upon the formula which is governed by the actual practical realities of the steel industry which found that prior to 1960 they actual had a SUB plan which had a very precise relationship, between how many hours you worked and the accumulation of credit units, and they determined that that wasn't necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.086" offset="7863672">It created an administrative headache that they didn't need because in point of fact people who are working at least 32 hours, if they worked at all because of the existence of the short-week benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.015" offset="7915395">And the short-week benefit provides that if you call an employee in during a week and have him worked less than 32 hours, essentially you're going to have to pay him for 32 hours anyway and so naturally your try not to call an employee at all unless you actually have 32 hours of week for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.057" offset="7995643">So the SUB plan and the formula for the earning of credit units in the SUB plan is tied to a formula which in the industry and the practical reality is based upon at least 32 hours of work achieving the earning of the entire -- of entitlement to 1/2 credit unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.469" offset="8077249">Now, whether or not that ever translates into a benefit, of course, depends upon whether the employee has to get laid off and that admittedly is a factor of his seniority, but the benefit as suppose to the layoff is not a factor of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.965" offset="8143182">Indeed it -- if it has any relationship with seniority it's a reverse relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.961" offset="8167215">One of the arguments that the Government has made in this case is that in trying to analogize to other benefits which have been before the Court, the closest benefit according to the Government is the severance pay that was before the Court in Accardi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.709" offset="8238164">Respondent believes that that analogy is faulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.427" offset="8253106">Severance pay is normally and was in Accardi very much a factor of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.061" offset="8283617">Somebody who had worked for that particular railroad 19 years and the 20-year people were not subject to the discharge but it was people with less than 20-year seniority, somebody who had worked for the railroad for 19 years was entitled to a larger amount of severance pay than somebody who had worked for 18 years and 17 years, and 16 years and back down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.762" offset="8386435">And that we submit was key to this Court's analysis of severance pay being a long-term benefit which really the notion of compensated service before the Court in the Accardi case really measuring only time on the role as an employee, but the SUB benefit is very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.148" offset="8467937">The 15-year man has no advantage whatsoever over the 2-year man so long as each have accumulated the maximum number credit units available are 52 and indeed as we've shown it might happen to work out that the 15-year man is at a disadvantage because of the diminution in the money in the fund should layoff reach his level of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.609" offset="8561768">So we don't feel that the SUB benefit can possibly be analogy -- analogized properly or fairly to a severance benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.822" offset="8598653">The Government has -- has argued this morning that in a sense the steel industry is acting in an inconsistent fashion in treating the 2-year continuous service requirement as seniority and crediting the veteran for that, but not crediting him with the time in the military for purposes of accruing credit units.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.691" offset="8694157">We don't feel that's inconsistent at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.002" offset="8703352">In the first place, the applicable bargaining agreements and plans expressly provide for both of those situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.861" offset="8734804">They expressly provide that service in the military will not break continuous service in the company and they expressly provide that there will be no accrual of credit units for the individual during the period of time he's in the military, so they're certainly consistent with the underlying contractual documents, but more important, they're consistent with what the industry regards as the law being as interpreted by this Court and other courts throughout the last several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.761" offset="8858415">Continuous service as that is defined in the pension program has indeed notions of seniority, notion of simply being on the rules as an employee and the industry recognizes that and does not break continuous service for pension purposes, for SUB purposes, for any benefit purposes when the veteran leaves the civilian employee and then comes back within the permitted statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.861" offset="8978787">But that's no different than the situation that was in front of this Court in the Foster v. Dravo case in which this Court considered vacation entitlement and this Court pointed out in a footnote that while you have to work in the required number of weeks in order to earn vacation eligibility for any particular year, if in fact a 5-year man has two weeks vacation and a 10-year man has 3 weeks vacation, and a 20-year man has 4 weeks vacation, in that sense under the plan in front of the Court in Dravo, the -- the defendant there, the company there did credit time and service for purposes of determining the maximum amount of vacation eligibility which an individual employee would have, and the Court noted that in its footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.107" offset="9191842">But that doesn't mean that earning that four weeks vacation that you may have the potential entitlement to is also a factor of seniority, the Court found that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.796" offset="9242520">It found that it was conditioned upon a bona fide work requirement that a traditional notion of a vacation is a short-term reward for work actually rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.764" offset="9282435">And that wasn't changed by the fact that also it's traditional that the amount of vacation you can earn a reward for is a factor of your total service over a large number of -- of years, and therefore a 20-year man may get four weeks vacation while a 15-year man get three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.234" offset="9356309">That didn't change the actual earning of vacation in any particular year as being key to a bona fide work requirement, as being reasonably key to such a requirement, that didn't change the traditional notion of vacation in this work site.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.779" offset="9414510">We think that the same is true with the SUB plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.321" offset="9428616">There is a minimum vesting period of 2 years, but it also should be understood that that period relates only to the actual entitlement to payment of a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.522" offset="9481488">It does not relate to the earning of the credit unit, so that the first week in which the individual employee works, he accumulates 1/2 credit unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.347" offset="9524746">He merely has a 2-year eligibility requirement before he can receive a benefit in the event of layoff, but that's -- that's no different than with lots of other benefits which don't kick in until an employee has had some minimum period of time with the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.579" offset="9597680">That's true in many companies of hospitalization benefits or sick pay of many other kinds of benefits which I think the Court would readily agree that if the focus is on the real nature of the benefit, those benefits are thought to be short-term compensation benefits rather perquisite of seniority, but they still may have an eligibility requirement that you be with the company 1 or 2 years before the company starts to fund those benefits for you and we don't think that that changes every benefit that may exist into a perquisite of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.415" offset="9732995">We don't think the Court found that in the Foster v. Dravo decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.565" offset="9765595">So in summing up, unless the Court has other questions, we think that the District Court in this case wrote two very detailed opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.793" offset="9810526">He wrote the first opinion before he had the benefit of this Court's guidance in Alabama Power in which he analyzed why the industry had the work requirement it had, why it had the formula it had, how the benefit was applied and as he interpreted the Court's decisions up to that point in time, he wrote a -- we believe very detailed opinion as to why the SUB benefit was not a perquisite of seniority and why the plan should be administered according to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.690" offset="9938108">Following this Court's decision in Alabama Power, he wrote another detailed opinion focusing precisely on the real nature of the benefit and concluding based upon the record made in front of him, that the real nature of the benefit with short-term compensation was substitute for wages in areas where wages had traditionally been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.421" offset="10029014">We believe those two decisions correctly interpret the plan and the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.319" offset="10048658">We believe the affirmance by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.155" offset="10071960">Would -- we would say one thing, there is of course a conflict between the Courts in this case and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which also had the steel industry plan in front it and it's decision in Hoffman v. Bethlehem Steel, but that decision and Your Honors I'm sure we'll read it carefully, was rendered in 1973 prior to either the opinion of this Court in Foster v. Dravo or the opinion of this Court -- of this Court in Alabama Power v. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.846" offset="10210722">And the focus of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Hoffman was that since it was theoretically possible to earn a 1/2 credit unit with as little as one hour work in a week, the Third Circuit felt that the same bizarre result which this Court had mention in Accardi was possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.035" offset="10299538">But this Court has indicated in its decision in Foster v. Dravo and its decision in Alabama Power v. Davis that that bizarre result theoretical though it maybe is not the appropriate analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.469" offset="10441226">I do have a couple points I would like to make Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.390" offset="10456900">First, in regard of the comment about the bizarre results, as Mr. Justice Blackmun pointed out, that is merely a theoretical analysis and I'm sure it was theoretical in Accardi as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.917" offset="10507055">The Court there was just using the bizarre results to indicate that the plan in no way attempted to compensate for the amount of work performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.871" offset="10542895">The same is true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.121" offset="10547806">There was absolutely nothing in this plan that indicates that SUB benefits are intended to be compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.030" offset="10579466">Respondent has noted the four factors that go into determining the amount of the weekly payment that is made, not one of those factors has anything to do with compensation for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.176" offset="10632025">The only work requirement that is involved in this case is the fact that most of the employees who earn this benefits work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.157" offset="10660028">There is not a requirement that all employees work.</text>
