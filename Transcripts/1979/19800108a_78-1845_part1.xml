            <label>Mr. James S. Veldman</label>
            <text syncTime="57.082" offset="331734">Thank you very much, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.517" offset="349393">Good morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.422" offset="353050">My name is James S. Veldman, and I represent the people of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.883" offset="370918">We are your petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.986" offset="383352">We are concerned in this case with the applicability or I might say our position being the complete lack of applicability to the facts in this case of the double jeopardy provisions of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.501" offset="457331">On November 20, 1974, John Vitale struck with his automobile and killed two young children.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.474" offset="497246">On December 23, 1974, he was found guilty on a traffic ticket which was issued at the scene of the collision, charging him with failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.463" offset="553253">On the following day December 24, 1974, Vitale was charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter and because he was a minor at the time those charges took the form of a petition for adjudication of wardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.066" offset="639666">The judge in the juvenile court branch of the Unified Circuit Court of Cook County finally dismissed the involuntary manslaughter charges out among other basis, on the basis of double jeopardy and the people have appealed up through the state court system and now come before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.073" offset="727646">As Your Honors undoubtedly know, the Supreme Court of Illinois has certified that its decision was based squarely upon its interpretation of the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.123" offset="771845">As you also know, I am sure, there was a very strong dissent in this case and I rely on a great deal of the logic and thinking of that dissent in my argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.298" offset="824613">It is our position that these offenses are not the same offenses for double jeopardy purposes in that, one, they are not the same offense as defined under double jeopardy purposes and, secondly, that the traffic offense is not a lesser included offense of the offense of involuntary manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.638" offset="933909">It is absolutely clear, Your Honors, that a person may not be twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.198" offset="972152">What the clause protects is it prevents multiple prosecutions and/or punishments for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.976" offset="1019277">And those are the critical words, as this Court well knows, the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.960" offset="1047176">The identity of the offense and not the act or series of acts involved is the crucial question presented in a double jeopardy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.961" offset="1087195">Blockburger v. United States, Ciucci v. Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.054" offset="1115617">Where one act or a series of acts in a violation of more than one statutory provision and where those violations are not the same offense as defined under Blockburger, that there is no prohibition about twice trying, convicting or punishing the defendant upon those charges, Blockburger as I have indicated, and Gavieres v. United States.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="282.249" offset="1232332">My problem, Mr. Veldman, in this case is, as you might have anticipated would be the problem of one or more members of the Court, is that whatever we might independently think about it, the Supreme Court of Illinois through the opinion of the late Mr. Justice Dooley has told us that in Illinois this is a lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.527" offset="1349465">And to be sure, there was a very vigorous dissenting opinion, but that is the construction of the law of Illinois by the Illinois Supreme Court and we have no choice but what to accept it, don't we?</text>

            <text syncTime="324.192" offset="1400142">Might I suggest to Your Honors that you do have a choice, and I suggest to you this.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.517" offset="1425429">In Brown v. Ohio, as I attempted to note in my second point in my reply brief, in Brown v. Ohio the question of whether the offense was a lesser included offense came before this Court more or less as a fait accompli.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.289" offset="1612570">In any event, the court has spoken through the late Mr. Justice Dooley, that is your court, the highest court of your state, and it has told us that in Illinois this failing to stop or rather driving at excessive speed is a lesser included offense of manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.386" offset="1684877">And we can't independently reexamine that holding, can we?</text>

            <text syncTime="399.423" offset="1701073">I believe that you can, Your Honor, because I believe that this Court must look at Mr. Justice Dooley's holding and I believe that you must consider it in light of, number one, the dissent, which I don't think of as subversive in this particular case at any rate, and also in light of the very clear definition of what is a lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.922" offset="1807026">I don't think this Court must find itself bound by a holding of a state court which would, of course, in effect -- if Your Honors feel bound by Mr. Justice Dooley's determination, then you must apply Brown v. Ohio, and for this Court to be put in that position where it has no choice but to follow Mr. Justice Dooley I submit is cutting unnecessarily down on what are obviously the powers of this Court.</text>
