            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="66.440" offset="369142">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.743" offset="382307">This case is here on the Government's petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.567" offset="409684">That Court granted respondent collateral relief from his conviction on the ground that certain testimony admitted at his trial of a jail cellmate was admitted in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.877" offset="478856">In the Fall of 1972, respondent was arrested and indicted on a charge of participation in a bank robbery in Norfolk, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.178" offset="512084">At his trial some months later, the prosecution's evidence included the testimony of two individuals who had been cellmates of respondent's at the Norfolk jail during the period between respondent's indictment and his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.915" offset="567045">One of the cellmates, Nichols, was a Government informant, the other Saddler was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.575" offset="593690">Both men testified about damaging admissions that respondent had made to them which indicated that he was a participant in the bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.397" offset="629008">Several years later, respondent filed a motion for collateral relief in which he charged for the first time, among other things, that the admission of Nichols' testimony violated his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.284" offset="680521">His motion was denied, but on appeal the Court of Appeals remanded for an evidentiary inquiry into the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.458" offset="709256">On remand, the District Court again denied the motion without a hearing on the basis of affidavits submitted by the two FBI agents regarding the nature of their contacts with the witness Nichols.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.763" offset="758471">The significant affidavit for purposes of this case was that of Agent Coughlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.646" offset="777906">Perhaps the best way to put the issue that is before the Court today into focus, is if I read the pertinent excerpts from his affidavit which are at Page -- begin at Page 57 (a) of the appendix of the petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.065" offset="847600">Agent Coughlan averred that on November 21, 1972, I contacted it with Benjamin Nichols at the Norfolk City Jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.062" offset="883649">Nichols had been contacted by me for approximately a year prior to this and during my contacts with him he had provided confidential information to the FBI and had been paid for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.368" offset="936835">The time that I contacted Nichols, Nichols advice that he was in the same cellblock as Billy Gale Henry as well as other prisoners who had federal charges against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.890" offset="974973">I recall telling Nichols at this time to be alert to any statements made by these individuals regarding the charges against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.159" offset="1004022">I specifically recall telling Nichols that he was not to question Henry or these individuals about the charges against them, however, but if they engaged them in conversation or talked in front of him, he was requested to pay attention to their statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.813" offset="1058670">I recall telling Nichols not to initiate any conversations with Henry regarding the bank robbery charges against Henry that if Henry initiated the conversations with Nichols, I requested Nichols to pay attention to the information furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.760" offset="1118438">The affidavit goes on to relate the provision of information to -- by Nichols to the agent after Nichols got out of jail and then it states at Page 59 (a), Nichols was paid by the FBI for expenses and services in connection with the request that Henry had made of him in jail and for the information furnished by Nichols.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.931" offset="1211120">Finally, it says I never requested that anyone affiliated with the Norfolk City Jail to place Edward Benjamin Nichols in the same cell of Henry.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.695" offset="1250200">Now, on the basis essentially of this affidavit, the District Court denied relief and on exactly the same basis, the Court of Appeals majority upheld respondent's Sixth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.371" offset="1296906">The Court described the issue before it is whether undisclosed Government monitoring of respondent's conversations while he was in custody violated his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.467" offset="1341210">In responding to the Government's argument based on language in Brewer against Williams suggesting that some form of interrogation is a prerequisite to finding a Massiah violation, the court held that requirement satisfied by general conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.150" offset="1395963">The holding which is under review today may perhaps best be summarized in the following statement from the Court of Appeals' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.820" offset="1422608">In the instant case, even if we assume that Nichols obeyed these instructions not to interrogate Henry about the bank robbery, Nichols did testify that he engaged in conversation with his cellmate Henry.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.227" offset="1468270">If by association, by general conversation or both, Henry developed sufficient confidents in Nichols that Nichols bared, excuse me, that Henry bared his incriminating secrets to a non-disclose paid informer, we think that there was interrogation within the meaning of Brewer and therefore violation of the Massiah doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.414" offset="1573073">Unfortunately, the facts are not very well developed, but in effect what happened was that the Court of Appeals granted summary judgment against us, determining that the mere fact that Nichols was informant, that he shared cell with Henry and then he engaged in general conversation --</text>

            <text syncTime="385.483" offset="1645275">Well, you don't mean in a technical sense that the Court of Appeals granted summary judgment against you, do you?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="391.699" offset="1670144">They granted relief without a hearing having been held on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.137" offset="1691878">In other words, they granted a relief on the assumption that the fact that there was association and general conversation was sufficient to make out a violation of the Massiah doctrine.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="408.853" offset="1738794">Has this Court ever held who has the burden of proof in a federal habeas action?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="413.848" offset="1758751">The habeas petitioner would have the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.248" offset="1772335">However, if as here was the case, it is conceded the operative facts on which the decision of the Court of Appeals rested or conceded by the Government and I think they are, then this Court can review the question of whether the Court of Appeals was correct in saying that was enough to grant relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.351" offset="1852792">Now, in dealing with the issue posed by this case, I think there are two different sets of variables to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.540" offset="1885497">The first set involves the manner in which the witness came to share a cell with the defendant and agreed to testify at trial on the prosecution's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.835" offset="1918725">The one extreme is a case like Milton against Wainwright, where an undercover officer posing as fellow inmate, is deliberately placed in the defendant cell.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.287" offset="1952475">Do you think it -- the case turns on whether he was deliberately placed there or he got there?</text>

            <text syncTime="471.658" offset="1989987">That is we think that they would have to be a reversal in either event, but in this case, as the record stands, there is no evidence that he was deliberately placed in there for the purpose of extracting statements from the respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.830" offset="2414738">Again, the possibilities can be rated along the spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.307" offset="2428635">At one end of the spectrum is an informant in an adjoining cell to the defendants who simply overhears incriminating statements, but has no interaction whatsoever with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.232" offset="2468342">At the other end is the situation in Milton in which an extended and calculated effort is made to “open the defendant up by repeated questioning about the crime of which the defendant stands charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.639" offset="2521945">Now unless the rationale underlying the Massiah doctrine is to be entirely reexamined, it seems clear that the Milton situation constitutes a denial of the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.640" offset="2561964">Conversely, I see absolutely nothing in the Court's opinions on the subject to suggest that the purely passive overhearing of conversations between the defendants and some third-party, other than the defendant's lawyer, could properly be held to evade the right to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.895" offset="3038960">I think that there is no basis in any of these Court's decisions to suggest that the transmitter would violate the right to counsel and while the opinion of the Court of Appeals initially cast the issue in terms of monitoring the defendant's conversations, I don't think even its decision really can be read to hold that near overhearing violates the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.753" offset="3126418">They relied on also the fact that there was conversation between the witness informant and the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.688" offset="3154108">It is clear, however, that the Court did not require that the conversation relate in any way to the defendant's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.333" offset="3184724">Accordingly, the narrow question before the Court is whether general conversation about sports, the weather or other neutral topics makes any incriminating statements thereafter volunteered by the defendant to a cellmate, inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.477" offset="3245328">Now as I understand that the Court of Appeals theory for finding a violation in such circumstances is thereby manifesting friendliness the informant will create an atmosphere in which the defendant is more likely to trust him and to reveal incriminating information.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.573" offset="3305618">Now, it seems plain to me that the Court of Appeals' decision cannot be squared either with the past descriptions of the kind of conduct that the Massiah rule prohibits or with the right to counsel rationale of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.717" offset="3358281">Looking first at what the Court has said is prohibited the Massiah opinion speaks of deliberate elucidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.850" offset="3386807">Now, elucidation is a somewhat vague term, but to me it clearly suggests some kind of drawing out, of overcoming some resistance to speak or at least of constructing some artificial situation that is particularly likely to produce the desired statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.162" offset="3452008">Massiah in fact involves specific questioning of the defendant about the crime by being informant and in Brewer, the Court made quite clear that interrogation or something quite like it is the touchstone for finding a violation of the right to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.394" offset="4264939">It's true that the state lost Brewer, but it is also true that the opinion in Brewer makes clear that there was both extended association and general conversation over a wide-ranging variety of topics and yet the Courts said that these ingredients alone would not render William's incriminating statements and actions admissible, at least that is how I read the statement by the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.807" offset="5262608">Now, Ash speaks of trial like confrontations and as I read the Spano opinion, it focuses on the notion that extra judicial interrogation of the accused which was unquestionably what there was in Spano, constitutes in effect the pre-trial trial, a trial outside the trial to invert the Hamlet metaphor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.664" offset="5350066">Now, bringing these notions to bear upon the present case, I don't think that there is anything about association and general conversation among cellmates in a jail that remotely resembles the trial type confrontation that brings the requirement that counsel be present into play.</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.628" offset="5625919">In the present case, the record is entirely consistent with the conclusion that respondent was quite willing to volunteer information about the crime and denied the specific interrogation or any kind of trick was necessary to draw him out on the subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="1709.739" offset="6942281">Here, we had Mr. Nichols in the jail and he knew from his past experiences I expect most people in jail cells probably know that if they can provide information that would be helpful to the prosecution on one of their cellmates they could expect some kind of consideration for this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.805" offset="7014588">I think it's fairly clear that if Nichols had not talked to agent Coughlan, but had simply in the expectation that he would probably get something listened though a saddler did and then come forward afterwards there would be no issue in this case from the Massiah violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.736" offset="7070281">Yet, what we have here is that Nichols and the agent communicate, the result of this communication is not really to impart any new information to Nichols that the FBI would like any confessions that Henry makes, Nichols knew that, but to impose constraints on the way Nichols' behaves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.412" offset="7365047">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.610" offset="7377795">In my view, the Court of Appeals was perfectly correct both in its view of the law and in its handling of the case given its peculiar procedural history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.493" offset="7421367">If we look at that procedural history, what we say is first of all the fact that the trial testimony of Mr. Nichols came before the jury without any knowledge of, excuse me, on the part of the defense that Mr. Nichols was an informant and because of that the deficiency in the development of the record as to the way in which he and Mr. Henry interacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.252" offset="7516348">The issue was squarely put by the first motion to vacate and the District Judge dismissed it without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.049" offset="7547591">The Court of Appeals then remanded to the District Judge with an opinion in which it explained to District Judge what facts to find and the District Judge rather than holding that evidentiary hearing, wrote a letter to the prosecutor, indicating that he believe the matter could be disposed of without the necessity of a public hearing and advised them if the agents did request Mr. Nichols or Sabbath to interview Henry, we probably will have to grant the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.333" offset="7668694">At that point, the affidavit of Agent Coughlan comes forward and says that he advised Mr. Nichols not to initiate conversations with regard to the bank robbery or to question Mr. Henry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.690" offset="7730134">Now, in that light, I think it is easy to understand that the Court of Appeals saw the question as whether or not the record was adequate for outright reversal of the conviction or whether on the contrary, it made sense to remand one more time for an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.934" offset="7803068">And with that in mind, I'd like to going on and take a look at the record because I believe the record strongly supports the conclusion that Court of Appeals was correct, no matter how we interpret the Massiah decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.003" offset="7859388">We know from the record that the bank robbery occurred on the 28th of August of 1972 and on that date, Mr. Moore and Mr. Locke were arrested and charged with a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.458" offset="7905155">On the 22nd of September, a complaint was sworn out by Agent O'Hara, who was the supervising agent in charge of the investigation, which indicates that at that time the case against Mr. Henry consisted of the FBI's knowledge that he had participated in the rental of the house on Wales Avenue in Norfolk at which Mr. Moore and Mr. Locke were arrested.</text>

            <text syncTime="2030.042" offset="8223535">As I was saying, when the complaint was sworn out in September with the case against Mr. Henry consisted of was evidence that he was connected with the rental of the house which was Mr. Moore and Mr. Locke were found in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.086" offset="8283721">On the 8th of November, the warrant turned up in Atlanta, Georgia and on the 10th of November, Mr. Henry was arrested in Atlanta, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.206" offset="8332204">On the 15th of November, Mr. Henry was indicted and charged with the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.395" offset="8360939">On the 21st of November, 1972, after a period of transit Mr. Henry arrived in Norfolk was put in a Norfolk City Jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.982" offset="8407333">At that time, from all we can tell from the record and I think the record clearly establishes that the government's case still consisted of the evidence that he was a participant in the rental of the hideout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.422" offset="8461040">On the 21st of November, Agent O'Hara visits Mr. Henry in the Norfolk City Jail, interrogates him of that and finally Mr. Henry refuses to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.092" offset="8515688">According to Agent O'Hara Mr. -- and his testimony which is at the transcript Page 106, Mr. Henry stated he would not like to answer general questions in regards to his activities as he was afraid, we would change his answers around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.762" offset="8582457">On the same day, without any more of a case then I've already laid out, on the very same day Mr. Coughlan tells us from his affidavit, Agent Coughlan, said he went to visit Mr. Nichols in the Norfolk City Jail at which time he gave him instructions with regard to Mr. Henry and although the affidavit of Agent Coughlan tells us that he placed limitations on what he wanted Mr. Nichols to do, it also tells us that he advised Mr. Nichols that there was a bank robbery, a bank robbery charge against Mr. Henry and what the agency was interested in was getting statements about the bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.274" offset="8756433">It was quite clear even if we believe that Mr. -- Agent Coughlan's affidavit in all of its nuances it is quite clear that he put Mr. Nichols on notice precisely as to what he wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.524" offset="8805439">On the 27th of November, Mr. Henry appeared in court for arraignment for the -- this is the first court appearance that we know from record on the morning he appeared without counsel before Judge McKenzie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.222" offset="8868237">Judge McKenzie asked him if he wanted counsel, he said he did and Judge McKenzie appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.937" offset="8891120">There was a recess taken and Mr. Henry was arraigned that afternoon and appeared in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.345" offset="8916720">The next thing the record tells us is that on the Sixth of December, Agent Coughlan again visited with Nichols and Nichols told him what information he had obtained from Mr. Henry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.641" offset="8977951">The information was essentially the same information that he testified to a trial, this we get from Agent Coughlan's affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.634" offset="9013896">Now, if we -- so, what we're talking about is the period of time from the 21st of November through the Sixth of December during the majority of which period Nichols and Henry and others were in jail together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.046" offset="9083591">Now, if we look at Nichols' trial testimony which admittedly is not laid out in -- admittedly was not the result of specific questioning on what happened between Nichols and Henry, we nevertheless see that the conversations that occurred between Henry and Nichols were quite directed and related quite specifically to the crime in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.348" offset="9976769">On the right to counsel question, it seems to me that the Hoffa case turns on the proposition that the evidence obtained from Hoffa by the undercover agent Partin was used in another case and that if the information had been obtained four years in the case before the Court at the time then we have Massiah.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.648" offset="10089932">By that, I mean if the Court, if you remember Your Honor, Hoffa was on trial in something referred to the opinion is the Test Fleet trial and Mr. Partin came to see him in an undercover role while he was awaiting trial during the period of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.639" offset="10169971">The testimony that Partin gave that was before this Court was his testimony in the jury tampering trial which resulted from, in part from the information that he developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.596" offset="10217723">On the Sixth Amendment question, it seems to me that the case turns on that and the Court -- in the Court's opinion we see a reference to that part of the Massiah opinion said -- which says that the crucial question is whether or not information in the pending case is elicited and used in the pending case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.271" offset="10288462">With regard to Hearst, Hearst of course relates to Mr. Chief Justice Burger's question before as to the placement of a listening device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.280" offset="10328482">The Ninth Circuit's opinion in Hearst turns on the fact that the listening device is a listening device which was generally available and used in that jail for the purpose of monitoring security matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.379" offset="13832861">And then finally we have on Page 137 again, the use of the word “described” in the questions and answers and again “tell,” all of which seems to leave me to the conclusion that although we believe the proper reading of the Massiah decision of the two pre curiums and of Brewer is that the Government may not after formal adversary proceedings seek to obtain information from the accused without respecting the right to counsel if we have to find what's tantamount to interrogation in this case under the circumstances of a jail cell, we got an adequate record to support the Court of Appeals in doing so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3477.241" offset="14012374">There's just a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.909" offset="14023032">I want to make clear what our position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.685" offset="14030137">It's not that the informant can't open his mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.144" offset="14043930">It said the informant can't lead the defendant to talk about the subject which he would not otherwise have talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.967" offset="14075277">Now, with respect to Justice Marshall's question of Professor Geltner, I think it's quite clearly our view that we could send somebody down to the bar to listen because we expect him to make statements at the bar about the crime and we could use those statements without violating Massiah.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.127" offset="14155839">Our motive to acquire information in my view is clearly not enough in the Court unless we do something more that constitutes elicitation by us the Court is being led to what seems to me an extreme position and it is an extreme position which is not the defensible under the right to counsel rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.950" offset="14231176">I did not hear Professor Geltner once to explain why the right to counsel is implicated in the listening post kind of situation.</text>
