            <label>Mr. Ned L. Conley</label>
            <text syncTime="134.179" offset="640084">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.559" offset="657638">I would like to illustrate the issue in this case with the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.815" offset="674670">Two people discover that two different chemicals can be used as herbicides to kill weeds in ricefields.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.893" offset="710928">These chemicals both kill weeds perfectly satisfactorily.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.218" offset="728273">One of the chemicals had no other known use and that is the kind of chemical we call in this case a non-staple material.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.062" offset="763591">The other chemical also has other known uses as, for example, maybe it could be used making a dye.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.320" offset="796609">This is called a staple material in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.346" offset="812805">The contention of the respondent Rohm and Haas in this case is that one of these inventors whose discovery uses the non-staple material should receive a greater reward for no reason other than that the material has not previously been known to have a use.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.927" offset="883127">Rohm and Haas' patent is on a method for killing weeds in ricefields by spraying a chemical called propanil on those weeds and on the ricefields.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.695" offset="918131">Now, propanil is not patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.654" offset="925968">Monsanto Company received a patent on propanil in 1968 and they sued Rohm and Haas for infringement of that patent and Rohm and Haas proved that the patent was invalid, that propanil had been known for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.201" offset="984168">Now, Rohm and Haas doesn't practice its patented invention, which is in the method for using propanil.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.553" offset="1005589">Instead, since they are a chemical company they manufacture propanil and they sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.415" offset="1025024">And there are instructions on the containers for using the patented method.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.784" offset="1046549">By virtue of this the purchasers, the farmers who use this and spray it on their ricefields have an implied license to use that patented method.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.636" offset="1085942">In addition to this, Rohm and Haas has refused to grant licenses to these farmers in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.935" offset="1115094">If the farmers want to use the patented process the only way they can do it is to buy the unpatented propanil from Rohm and Haas.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.164" offset="1148008">Otherwise, they are infringers.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.304" offset="1160547">Now, the petitioners in this case sell propanil, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.073" offset="1175698">They sold it long before the Monsanto patent issued in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.922" offset="1199104">Our containers also have labels on them which give instructions for using the propanil on ricefields.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.767" offset="1226480">We are required to do this by law, by the EPA, because otherwise people might misuse it and cause harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.344" offset="1260753">Because of this Rohm and Haas sued the petitioners on the patent, on the day it issued in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.170" offset="1288025">We filed a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.701" offset="1298160">This motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.661" offset="1305997">In its very thorough opinion the District Court held that using a patent to obtain a monopoly in propanil, which Rohm and Haas did not invent and which was not covered by the patent, was a misuse of the patent.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="315.154" offset="1363989">Mr. Conley, if you will notice the last page of Judge Gee's opinion in the Fifth Circuit at page A-48 of the petition for certiorari he quotes Judge Richards, saying that -- I think he says himself these are the kinds of cases that are argued by professionals to amateurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.317" offset="1460642">And so you may take my question in that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.732" offset="1482271">Is it fair to say that both the doctrines of contributory infringement and patent misuse are to a certain extent the obverse sides of the same coin, neither of them are the substance of the patent or what can be patented?</text>
            <text syncTime="360.859" offset="1546846">One is trying to expand what is patentable and the other is enabling the patentee to police the patent?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ned_l_conley" startTime="371.229" stopTime="408.685">
            <label>Mr. Ned L. Conley</label>
            <text syncTime="371.229" offset="1588328">I believe I can say a qualified "Yes" to that, because certainly the doctrine of misuse is a doctrine that grew out of attempts by patent owners to expand the patent grant beyond something or to use the patent in such a way as to obtain a control which the patent grant in and of itself does not grant them.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.207" offset="1668159">Whereas, the doctrine of contributory infringement was a doctrine which grew up for the purpose of allowing patentees a way to enforce their patents to prevent infringement in situations where it was impractical to file suit against all the individual direct infringers.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.732" offset="1734301">Does that answer --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="408.685" stopTime="411.865">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="408.685" offset="1738062">That would be particularly true in combination patents, wouldn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ned_l_conley" startTime="411.865" stopTime="495.291">
            <label>Mr. Ned L. Conley</label>
            <text syncTime="411.865" offset="1750810">Yes, that is primarily true in the case of combination patents but I believe it is also applicable in the case of the type of patent we have here, which is a patent on a method of using a chemical.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.061" offset="1811623">Now, Rohm and Haas agrees, and I think the Court of Appeals decision agreed, that the owner of a patent on a method which uses one of these staple chemicals cannot compel those people who want to use the patented process to buy the staple chemical from the patent owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.172" offset="1872018">But the Court held, this Court of Appeals held, that Section 271(c) and (d) were enacted by Congress for the purpose of authorizing the patent owner to monopolize these non-staple materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.905" offset="1919039">That was the effect of their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.644" offset="1929906">As agreed by everyone who has filed a brief in this case that 271(c) and (d) were enacted as an outgrowth of the decisions by this Court in the two Mercoid cases in 1944, in those cases this Court found there was patent misuse by one who sold a non-staple element of a patented combination, the type that you just discussed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, who licensed, as the patentee did there, other people to sell this unpatented element and they sued contributory infringers who made and sold the unpatented element without a license.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="495.291" stopTime="496.938">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="495.291" offset="2084551">Was that a staple or a non-staple?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ned_l_conley" startTime="496.938" stopTime="558.591">
            <label>Mr. Ned L. Conley</label>
            <text syncTime="496.938" offset="2091133">It was a non-staple it was conceded to be in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.705" offset="2110151">The Court went further then and raised the question as to whether this decision left anything at all of the law of contributory infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.089" offset="2143692">Because of the -- well, at least unrest that this caused there was great effort made again to get a statutory law of contributory infringement enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.030" offset="2195519">And such a law was enacted, one which specifically defines in subsection (c) a contributory infringement is, in effect, the selling without a license from the patent owner of the nonstable material.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.927" offset="2247032">And then subsection (d) was enacted which said that those specific things, that is the selling of the non-staple material, the licensing others to sell, and the suing of people who sell it without license, that those things would not be misuse and that such a patent owner who was doing these things would not be held guilty of misuse if he was otherwise entitled to relief.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="558.591" stopTime="560.973">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="558.591" offset="2337729">Were they conjunctive or disjunctive?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ned_l_conley" startTime="560.973" stopTime="651.953">
            <label>Mr. Ned L. Conley</label>
            <text syncTime="560.973" offset="2347238">In the statute it says if you do anyone of these or any combination of the three.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.895" offset="2379003">Well, the Mercoid case did not involve merely the selling, the licensing and the suing, it involved a great deal more.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.517" offset="2409409">In the Mercoid cases this Court repeated the long-standing rule limiting patent monopolies to the inventions defined by the patent claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.003" offset="2443368">Now, that rule has been around probably since the patent law was first enacted in 1790 or when claims were first thought of in about 1836.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.675" offset="2482030">It was held to be misuse in the Mercoid cases for a patent owner to condition a license under his patent on the purchase of an unpatented element.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.367" offset="2516825">And the Court specifically held that that rule applied to non-staple materials or elements as well as to staple materials or elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.463" offset="2553187">Now, there is nothing in Sect-on 271 or any other part of the 1952 Act which recodifies the patent laws which changes those specific rules of law which were the real basis for the decision finding misuse in the Mercoid cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.457" offset="2613164">Instead, to the contrary, the recodification included Section 154 which defines the scope of the patent grant as the right to exclude others from making, using or selling the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.253" offset="2668335">It is conceded that Rohm and Haas did not invent propanil.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.605" offset="2685785">That is the way the law has always been and it was continued without dissent in the 1952 statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="651.953" stopTime="666.303">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="651.953" offset="2711176">But the question is whether the doctrine of contributory infringement has been reintroduced and Mercoid, in effect, either sharply cut back on or overruled by the congressional Act, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ned_l_conley" startTime="666.303" stopTime="733.042">
            <label>Mr. Ned L. Conley</label>
            <text syncTime="666.303" offset="2768541">Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.141" offset="2779930">The real issue, I think, is just that, as to whether or not in 271 that the doctrine of contributory infringement was restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.763" offset="2826428">And the reason that that question arose was because there was a serious question as to whether it existed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.843" offset="2850774">And so the arguments were made to the congressional committees that we had to have a statutory statement of contributory infringement so that this Court would recognize that Congress wanted patent owners to have a right to sue contributory infringers.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.066" offset="2915662">And that is what Congress did, is enact a statute that says it is O.K. to sue contributory infringers.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.600" offset="2945755">But the patents, the patent grants the exclusive rights only to the invention, and 271(b) did not say, or 271(c) did not say that the patent owner has exclusive rights in the non-staple element or component of the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.815" offset="3010644">That grant is stated in Section 154, which says it is just the invention that the exclusive right extends to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.971" offset="5931238">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.347" offset="5944717">I believe that the fundamental question before the Court is whether or not the language of the 1952 Patent Act and, in particular, Section 271 approves of Rohm and Haas' conduct in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.883" offset="6002918">Now, the Court of Appeals in a lengthy, detailed and, I think, scholarly analysis unanimously held that Section 271 did in fact approve of Rohm and Haas' conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.020" offset="6051401">And we submit, needless to say, that that decision is entirely correct and should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.535" offset="6077524">And I think as Mr. Justice Rehnquist mentioned, that basically what we have involved here and as the Court of Appeals also recognized, we have a clash between two principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.356" offset="6124753">We have the principle of the patent laws which attempts to stimulate innovation and protect inventions on the one hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.437" offset="6161115">And we have a clash with the concepts of the patent misuse doctrine on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.709" offset="6182222">And in principle those two concepts are antagonistic and logically they cannot coexist one with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.747" offset="6214405">That conflict is precisely what was presented to Congress when it debated whether or not to pass what is now Section 271.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.459" offset="6253171">The Mercoid decision had drawn the line with respect to that conflict and it had drawn that line on the side of misuse almost to the exclusion of the law of patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.939" offset="6303117">And for the next four years people attempted to draft an Act that would move that line to more of a middle road position and for the next four years through three separate hearings, many debates, Congress attempted to draw that line in a manner consistent with public policy as Congress perceived it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.608" offset="6393814">Prior to Section 271 it of course had been the courts that had drawn the line and now it was time for Congress if you will, to try its hand at drawing that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.392" offset="6432893">Congress determined public policy and it drew that line dependent upon the distinction between staple and non-staple articles.</text>

            <text syncTime="2140.753" offset="8666363">Well, we can only that, Your Honor, by looking at others who produce propanil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.682" offset="8690082">There are approximately 9,000 rice farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.390" offset="8704920">There are approximately 3,000 aerial applicators who would be practicing directly the method of our patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.978" offset="8735326">And this is one of the fundamental problems when you are dealing with a patent of this kind is trying to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.735" offset="8758314">If you had to go out and try to license all 9,000 farmers or license all 3,000 applicators it would cost you more to get the licenses, in all likelihood, even if you could get the farmers to agree to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.716" offset="8810245">So as a practical matter the only way you can enforce your patent and maintain your exclusivity is through the doctrine of contributory infringement which permits you to go to the source, if you will, of the infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.680" offset="8866043">It should be kept in mind there is no legitimate competition at the present time in propanil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.076" offset="8895718">By its very definition as conceded, anytime you sell propanil you are guilty of contributory infringement under Section 271(c) and because of the definition of contributory infringement the sale of propanil by the petitioners necessarily leads to a direct infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.839" offset="8974712">That is the whole basis of the distinction between staples and non-staples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.649" offset="8993938">With staple products there is a legitimate existing business outside of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.428" offset="9021106">With propanil, there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.732" offset="9030301">It has no other use except to infringe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.473" offset="9045243">Propanil of course was known from back in 1903 as a chemical compound but for 50 years it had no use, it was a laboratory curiosity, it was of no benefit to mankind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.008" offset="9099368">Rohm and Haas, through the expenditure of a lot of research dollars and development dollars and obtaining approval from the Government, developed a specific use for propanil which has been a great benefit to rice growers, to farmers and the public in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.469" offset="9157256">They created the market for propanil and today, some 20 years after the original disclosure and knowledge and invention, the only use of propanil remains in the patented invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.466" offset="9213262">And for so long as it remains a non-staple, namely no use other than as an infringement, we believe in accordance with Section 271 that we are entitled to the conduct and the activity which we have carried out today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.765" offset="9278464">And that activity and that conduct was known to those who considered the Patent Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.746" offset="9306363">My opponent has said that in the early hearings -- I assume he is referring to the 1948 and the 1949 hearings -- that Mr. Rich, now Judge Rich, who was a speak on behalf of the Act indicated that that was the intention of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.190" offset="9372087">That is very clear, he did indicate and stated specifically that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.389" offset="9388910">Now, the language has not changed in any substantial manner from the time it was first presented in 1948 until the present day when it was enacted as Section 271.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.176" offset="9432064">Not only did Judge Rich indicate that this was the intended meaning or one of the intended activities that would be permitted without it being a misuse but the Justice Department vigorously protested the passage of Section 271.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.167" offset="9500087">They testified in 1949 and they testified in 1951 and in '49, page 2, they said that enactment would enable the patentee to exercise control over the unpatented materials usable in his patent process and oust from the marketplace his competitor dealing in the same material.</text>

            <text syncTime="2489.378" offset="10060884">And I started to respond to your question with reference to the Mercoid decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.548" offset="10077602">There were a lot of things decided in Mercoid but one of them dealt with the situation in which licenses were granted only with the sale of a non-staple and the Justice Department recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.548" offset="10125563">For example at page 54 of the '49 hearings they characterized the Mercoid decision, and if I may indulge, it said."</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.143" offset="10159940">Instead of meeting its competition in traditional ways it sought a competitive advantage by permitting those who bought its switches to use them in the patented combination, whereas those who bought the switches elsewhere were subject to attack for infringement and those who sold switches were sued for contributory infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.807" offset="10226604">And that is a characterization of the Mercoid facts which can be found at 320 U.S. 676 in the concurring opinion of Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.493" offset="10269341">So that one of the evils, if you will, of Mercoid was exactly the alleged evil that we have here, and it was recognized as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.334" offset="10304658">And Mr. Rich was questioned whether or not that wasn't a fundamental reason for the Mercoid holding, and he agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.612" offset="10333811">And Mr. Rich was asked, well, would that behavior be permitted under the Act? And the answer was "Yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.738" offset="10354291">Very clearly, "Yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.369" offset="10360874">So I would submit that the Justice Department has raised in 1948 and 1951 exactly the arguments that were raised here and fundamentally Congress faced that question, Congress was faced with a public policy decision Where do we draw the line between these competing doctrines?</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.789" offset="10442480">And it drew that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.807" offset="10450631">It drew that line after very, very careful consideration with all of the opponents and all the proponents and all of the consideration that went into that wording.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.181" offset="10488142">And as I stated earlier, the wording remained remarkably the same from the time the Act was first introduced in 1948 until today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.918" offset="10527013">And I would respectfully submit to this Court that the decision by the Court of Appeals is eminently correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.903" offset="10562957">It was a scholarly analysis, yes, they weighed things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.011" offset="10579466">They said, well, if we look at it through the lens of misuse we reach one result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.859" offset="10594826">If we look at it through the lens of the patent law, we reach another result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.719" offset="10610291">It was very careful balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.938" offset="10619173">What my opponent has done is to select certain portions where the Court was doing the balancing and has ignored what the Court ultimately held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.334" offset="10660760">And what the Court ultimately held was there is no obligation to compulsorily license your patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.793" offset="10690539">What the COURT held was Section 271 permits you to do one or more of the defined acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.735" offset="10714363">It doesn't require you to license in order to sell propanil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.443" offset="10733171">The effective result of reversing the Court of Appeals would be a compulsory licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.744" offset="10762324">My opponent claims that it would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.121" offset="10771832">I would respectfully submit that it is and it was recognized to be the result of compulsory licensing by the Court of Appeals as well as by the lower court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2815.498" offset="11365334">For example, there are the 9,000 rice farmers and, in addition, that is complicated further by the fact that they just don't spray this, they use aerial applicators to spray the propanil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.277" offset="11420505">There are 3,000 aerial applicators, using 86,000 aircraft.</text>

            <text syncTime="2841.718" offset="11470242">The hub of the contributory infringement doctrine is that it is impractical to go after these 9,000 farmers plus 3,000 aerial applicators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.688" offset="11510157">But it is practical to stop the contributory infringers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.016" offset="11527398">And Congress in section 271(c) and (d) was explicit with respect to non-staple articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.474" offset="11557282">The significance of the non-staple article is that it creates a market.</text>

            <text syncTime="2869.294" offset="11580583">A monopoly means that there is something there before that was taken away.</text>

            <text syncTime="3154.485" offset="12721298">And the significance of it as a resource is, Point 1, there are 10 million compounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.553" offset="12837595">Point 3, the universities -- researchers at universities and elsewhere want to publish and in publishing they frequently publish compounds that are in the early stages for which they have no known use or utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.438" offset="12901125">And by having this patent protection available, as you move down the line this gives an opportunity to promote further work with respect to those then useless chemicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.372" offset="12956818">And in Item 4 within the area of the pesticides, a survey conducted in 1972, 20 percent of the pesticides had no use other than this use protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.646" offset="13017945">And the character of the investment and high risk involved here, for example to get a pesticide approved requires going through the EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.957" offset="13083251">And in going through the EPA, there is much experimental work required and it runs over several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.178" offset="13108120">The year factor is eight years at a cost of roughly $15 million-plus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.759" offset="13130376">Now that eight years also comes out of the patent grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.407" offset="13145004">But in looking at the character of the protection provided, in dealing with patents we are talking about subject matter and conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.379" offset="13176874">The subject matter is defined by the claims but then before that patent is granted it is screened by the Patent Office to insure that it meets the conditions of patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.142" offset="13219924">And patents are classified in several ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.345" offset="13236746">One of them is in products, per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.535" offset="13253465">Another is in the use patent which is set forth in 100 (b) and 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.505" offset="13273422">100 (b) is new with the 1972 Patent Act.</text>
