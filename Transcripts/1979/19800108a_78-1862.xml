            <text syncTime="56.895" offset="331003">Mr. Chief Justice and Members of This Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.163" offset="352005">Fred Walker was a carpenter, and on August 22, 1975, he was driving an ARMCO nail into a piece of wood and it shattered, putting out his eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.844" offset="406758">He came to my firm and eventually we filed a suit on August 19, 1977, within the two-year statute of limitation in the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.828" offset="450644">And the summons were, what shall we say, lost?</text>
            <text syncTime="93.263" offset="476453">We thought the marshal had them and the marshal thought the Clerk had them.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.290" offset="488573">And we did a file review some 90 days later and we found them in our filing cabinet.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.348" offset="504769">We took them down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.362" offset="508844">I want to be square with you.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="103.309" stopTime="105.111">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="103.309" offset="516577">In your filing cabinet?</text>

            <label>Mr. Don Manners</label>
            <text syncTime="105.111" offset="523786">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.693" offset="526190">I can't find who -- no one will admit in the firm ever bringing them back but, anyway, we found them in an unmarked folder in the filing cabinet on a file review.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.177" offset="560044">That's how we found out they didn't get to the marshal.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.082" offset="571747">In any event, the summons are taken to the marshal and ARMCO is served some 104 days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.003" offset="603408">Now, Oklahoma has a statute that they must be served within 60 days beyond the statute of limitation, part of their statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.422" offset="637053">It's a question of whether or not it is procedural or substantive, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.320" offset="652622">And, of course, under Rule 3, you don't have that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.209" offset="668191">Anyway, service was had and then the Ragan Case came like a falcon out of the skies and struck down our lawsuit, and here we are.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.854" offset="718764">The Ragan Case was decided somewhat before your lawsuit, wasn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Don Manners</label>
            <text syncTime="173.233" offset="796296">Anyway, Judge Doyle of the Tenth Circuit, when he wrote his opinion, the last paragraph states, "The Supreme Court would perform a great service if it were to clear away the dilemma which exists as a result of the conflict between Ragan and Hanna."</text>
            <text syncTime="192.904" offset="874977">He says, "We recognize that decisions are frequently allowed to die on the vine, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.806" offset="902562">We also recognize under such instances death does not, as a practical matter, take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.699" offset="922206">If, however, Ragan was intended to die a natural death, it failed to happen."</text>
            <text syncTime="209.390" offset="940910">So what we are here -- I am attempting to persuade--</text>

            <text syncTime="224.362" offset="1000782">Now, Chief Justice Warren in the Hanna Case wrote a spectacular decision, well-reasoned, well thought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.733" offset="1042265">And Justice Harlan in his concurring --</text>

            <text syncTime="243.417" offset="1077060">But Justice Harlan stated in his concurring opinion that he thought Ragan was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.363" offset="1100779">And you know, going back at the beginning, under 28 -- Section 2072, when they enacted the Rules, the Federal Rules, it said, "All laws in conflict with such Rules should be a little further force or effect unless, of course, they invade the substantive portion."</text>
            <text syncTime="272.834" offset="1194715">So, really what we are talking about is whether or not the Federal Rules of commencement of an action in service are procedural or substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.134" offset="1239960">You know, I am from Oklahoma and I don't like to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.622" offset="1261902">Basically speaking, we've got an awful good State there, but I'm not much in favor of a service statute where your defendant can hide out for 61 days and you've lost your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.524" offset="1305475">If you can't find him in 61 days or prove he's out of the State, you're just dead in the water down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.585" offset="1329716">I don't think it was intended that the Federal Rules for the Courts of all the Federal Courts here, I don't think it was intended that the 60-day--</text>

            <text syncTime="322.070" offset="1391679">I think you have a very hard time trying to find somebody in Manhattan, and that's a lot smaller than Oklahoma City.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.232" offset="1440266">This is not the first time I have run afoul of the 60-day deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.177" offset="1456044">Sometimes you just can't find them, and you're dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.461" offset="1465240">But in this case I feel particularly bad because Mr. Walker had an injury and somehow or other, like something dropping from the skies, I find the summons in the filing cabinet back in the office on a file review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1181.717" offset="4830229">MR. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.881" offset="4842872">I am Jay M. Galt, from the Law Firm of Looney, Nichols, Johnson &amp; Hayes, Oklahoma City, representing the Respondent ARMCO Steel Corporation, an Ohio corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.641" offset="4889893">The facts of the case are much as outlined by Mr. Manners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.258" offset="4920404">However, I would like to point out to the Court that ARMCO Steel Corporation retains a National Service Corporation as its resident agent in the State of Oklahoma, whose office is located within four blocks of the Federal Courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.816" offset="4998666">And when service was effected, 101 days after the statute of limitations had run, that was the very first notice, the first notice that ARMCO had received of any claim by Mr. Walker against ARMCO for injuries he allegedly sustained by reason of a defective nail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.382" offset="5100857">The Petitioner in this case is a resident of the State of Oklahoma, took advantage of the diversity statute, and chose his forum in the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.846" offset="5174732">The Petitioner admits that had he filed this case in the State District Court, and, in fact, it might have been an after thought that he filed it in the Federal Court, his initial pleading is denominated a petition rather than a complaint, and in our State Court we would call our initial pleading a petition, he chose the Federal Court and has admitted that had he filed this in the State Court, and the same facts had existed, no service for 101 days, without question, his case would have been barred and dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.162" offset="5352051">But because he was fortuitous enough to file it in the Federal Court, we are now before this Honorable body today asking and questioning whether or not Ragan should prevail as the rule covering this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.138" offset="5427911">It is the position of the Respondent, obviously, that Ragan is good law and that if this Court were to reverse Ragan and hold that Hanna applied, and that the commencement of this action by filing with the Clerk tolled the statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1394.205" offset="5680149">We think that Rule 3 does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.006" offset="5699375">State law applies, and the State law is very clear that if you file your action within the appropriate statute of limitations period, from the time that that statute runs, you then have 60 days to effect service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.256" offset="5756426">And there is a case Taylor v. Taylor that Judge Doyle cites that is out of our Court of Appeals, that says that the filing commences the action, but there is one step more required to effect jurisdiction of the State District Court, and that is service on the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.768" offset="5838451">And it sets that other step that the Petitioner in this case failed to take for reasons that he has been very honest with the Court about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.024" offset="5895502">The important thing that I see in this case is that should this Court decide that Rule 3 commences an action to toll the limitations, what happens to the diversity defendant who has the same case filed in the State Court, the same facts being present, no service for 101 days, and then mistakenly that diversity defendant to obtain the benefits of the diversity rule removes his case to the Federal Court, files his motion to dismiss and finds that it will be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.454" offset="6077210">Because had he stayed in the State Court, his motion to dismiss would have been sustained but because the Federal Court--</text>
