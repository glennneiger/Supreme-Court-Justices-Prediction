            <text syncTime="15.409" offset="164968">Just before the Court rose yesterday, Mr. Justice Marshall asked me what would be wrong with our having to comply with Rule 23 in suits in which make whole relief is sought as well as injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.084" offset="251695">Basically there would be three things that would be wrong with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.323" offset="272697">They are somewhat interrelated.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.556" offset="281579">The first is there is no reason to think that Congress intended so sharp a change from the traditional practice in suits by the government or its agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.984" offset="347303">Not only was Congress presumably familiar with the pattern of government litigation under many other statutes, but there had indeed been 69 suits filed by the Attorney General between 1964 and 1972 under section 707 of this act, some of which had sought relief that would benefit a class of persons such as preferential hiring order, constructive seniority and the like, and in none of those cases had it ever been suggested by anyone that Rule 23 procedures need be used and --</text>

            <text syncTime="105.580" offset="525667">None of them up until 1972 did, although some decided shortly thereafter did include claims for monetary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.957" offset="571225">The legislative history indicates that the newly authorized governmental suits under section 706 were to be assimilated to the section 707 suits to the point where the sponsors of the legislation said section 707 would essentially become a redundancy in the law and that everything could be accomplished under section 706 that previously could be accomplished only under section 707.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.562" offset="797654">Except for that quality, as far as we can see in the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.276" offset="844466">The government to be able to sue under 706 as well as 707?</text>
            <text syncTime="190.108" offset="863796">Apparently it was the idea that the commission would become the primary enforcement mechanism and that there would be -- that the law would be enforced primarily by governmental suits rather than private suits and that the government should not have to sue only in pattern or practice cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.075" offset="955643">Even though if one takes a generous enough view of pattern or practice, most cases could be sit into the pattern or practice terminology, but not all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.519" offset="1001409">That seemed to be the predominant thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.610" offset="1013844">I think it was really part of the compromise between those who thought that the commission should have the cease and desist authority and those who thought that court enforcement should continue to be the method of enforcement, but that the commission would have the responsibility of bringing most of the court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.818" offset="1094614">The second thing that would be wrong with this, and this cuts it seems to me a little more deeply into the case, is that it would cast the government in an inappropriate role in enforcement of the statute, and in some ways this is among the most important things about the Court's opinion in this case, the role to be envisioned for the government in the enforcement of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.940" offset="1215091">The commission and the Attorney General have never understood that role to be the role of a proxy for individual complainants or for any particular class of persons, and there is no lawyer-client relationship established with any particular group of persons as there is in the statutes that we discussed yesterday, where possibly the government could bring a class action where it is serving as a lawyer for particular individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.540" offset="1357511">The commission's assignment and the Attorney General's assignment in the cases that they are to bring or he is to bring is to enforce the law rather than to act on behalf of any individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.966" offset="1411218">This is indicated on the face of the statute itself, which is section 706 is set forth on page A34 of the appendix to the petition for certiorari, and it starts off saying the commission is empowered as hereafter provided to prevent any person from engaging in any unlawful employment practice as set forth in the other provisions, not to represent any group of individuals, and there are other references that are consistent with this view of the government's role in enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.053" offset="1579551">I want to refer to only one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.732" offset="1586343">On page A-37, in section (f)(l) there, it says, "If within thirty days," et cetera, "the Commission has been unable to secure from the respondent a conciliation agreement acceptable to the Commission, the Commission may bring a civil action"</text>
            <text syncTime="392.955" offset="1675160">The responsibility is to see to it that the law is enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.416" offset="1693027">If the commission is satisfied that the agreement properly implements the law, there is no obligation to any particular group or class of persons to make sure that they are satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.707" offset="1738167">Of course, if they won't agree to the agreement, there might be litigation in any event, but the commission would not have the responsibility to conduct that litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.519" offset="1861465">It has always been, the practice has always been that they have statutory authority to seek the relief for -- to see to it that the law is complied with and that those who have been denied proper wages are made whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.765" offset="1914441">It is part of the statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.379" offset="1924890">There never has been the use of Rule 23 in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.713" offset="1950177">Those cases don't present some of the complexities and considerations and the possibilities for divergence of the public interest from private interests that are involved in Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.567" offset="2009631">The standards are very clear under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.562" offset="2025618">It is almost once you've done your factual investigation, it is almost a mathematical exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.211" offset="2048188">Title VII is very different from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.389" offset="2060936">Even if one takes a rather one-sided view of the government's enforcement responsibilities, if you pose an example of getting rightful place seniority relief under this Court's decision in Franks v. Bowman Transportation Company, for example, the question is who is entitled to that rigthful place in seniority relief in many situations, what classes of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.004" offset="2179427">If it can be secured only for a particular racial group, that is more advantageous to the members of that class than if it is broadened to include other ethnic or gender groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.106" offset="2223835">On the other hand, if it isn't broadened to include these other groups, they are being disadvantaged by the granting of it to the first group.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.165" offset="2264064">There are strains here, there are possibilities of competition among claimants so that the commission would be embarked on a treacherous course if it thought of its role as anything other than seeing to it that the law is properly enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.439" offset="2333132">If it thought of itself as to be cast in the role of a representative for any particular group and --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="565.287" offset="2364479">What if it thought the law wasn't being properly enforced, why can't it gain everything it wants by a simple injunction?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="573.072" offset="2395617">Well, there is make whole relief and part of what the legislative history reflected was that the commission was to be able to get broader based relief and more comprehensive relief, similar to the relief that had been secured in class actions brought by private individuals theretofore under section 706, even though for other purposes the action by the commission or the Attorney General was to be assimilated to the familiar kind of action under 707.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.201" offset="2540126">The example that I have given is really two one-dimensional examples because Title VII protects the rights of all persons not to be discriminated against on the basis of their race and their sex or their sex or the other classifications, and while the commission, the United States are of course committed to an effective enforcement policy of putting an end to discrimination wherever it is found, to finding effective remedies to make whole the victims of discrimination and to prevent its reoccurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.861" offset="2694771">As this Court is well aware, sometimes remedies can be excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.483" offset="2721311">Sometimes this Court has found remedies that we have contended for to be excessive, and they can in extreme cases become an instrument that treats other unfairly, an instrument of discrimination in themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.201" offset="2776168">And when the United States or the commission brings its weight and its resources into the enforcement of this law, it must be with an awareness of all of the rights that will be affected, including other rights that were respected under Title VII, collective bargaining rights, managerial prerogatives, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.960" offset="2871254">It must not approach these cases with a one-dimensional view that it is serving only as a representative of a particular class of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.760" offset="2914408">That to us is at the heart of this case and that is our understanding of the way Congress expected governmental authorities to carry out their responsibilities under this statute, just as they do under any other statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.764" offset="2986402">It is a law enforcement responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.561" offset="3013569">And this element of detachment of the commission or of the Attorney General from the particular interests involved is reflected in many details of practice under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.757" offset="3078353">The commission need not include all of the issues raised by a charging party in its suit, if it concludes that some of them are without merit, and it is not limited to the issues raised by the charging party or even to the interests that the charging party represents because the failure to include the interests of others found to be victims of this discrimination might result in the suit working to their detriment in some circumstances actually, and the commission's responsibility is to enforce the law in a more comprehensive manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.548" offset="3217533">Moreover, the charging party is not bound when the commission thinks there is no merit in the charge at all and refuses to bring suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.209" offset="6704253">They were not bound by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.474" offset="6709269">They were entitled to bring their own actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.735" offset="6826297">So the only people bound are those who file a written consent, and the only people who get relief are those who file a written consent to be a party plaintiff.</text>
