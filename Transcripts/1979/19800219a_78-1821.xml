            <text syncTime="12.202" offset="152221">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.434" offset="165073">This case is here on writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, reversing respondent's conviction for possession of heroin on the ground that the heroin in question had been discovered as a result of an illegal search.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.444" offset="229125">The case began when two trained DEA agents assigned to the Detroit Airport observed respondent deplane from an early morning flight from Los Angeles which they knew to be a major source city for heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.887" offset="282937">The agents became suspicious when she exhibited unusual nervousness and scanned the terminal area as though looking for surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.750" offset="314389">After following her through the airport and having their suspicions reinforced, they approached her as she was proceeding down the concourse toward the gate for an Eastern Airlines flight to Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.892" offset="358902">They identified themselves as federal agents and asked if she would show them some identification and her ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.703" offset="390144">She did so and they discovered that she was traveling under an assumed name.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.047" offset="411564">After several more questions, they asked if she would accompany them to the nearby DEA office for further questioning, which she did.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.234" offset="448345">Once inside the office, the agents asked respondent if she would consent to a search of her pocketbook and of her person, informing her that she had a right to refuse consent to the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.700" offset="494216">She consented and the ensuing search disclosed over half a pound of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.675" offset="518040">The entire encounter took about ten minutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.377" offset="628903">In any event, up to the point where the consent was given to the search was a relatively brief period of only a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.631" offset="669863">The District Court found that the agents had a reasonable suspicion that respondent was engaged in criminal activities at the time they first approached her, that she went to the office with the agents voluntarily in a spirit of apparent cooperation, and that she thereafter voluntarily consented to the search.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.473" offset="1065253">No, I intended to rely on Martinez-Fuerte for that proposition, because in Martinez-Fuerte, as I will get to, the Court suggested that the quantum of suspicion that was needed for a roving patrol stop in Brignoni-Ponce was not necessary for a referral to the secondary inspection area for questioning in Martinez-Fuerte, and I think -- while I think they had enough suspicion to meet the normal Brignoni-Ponce standard in this case, I think the minimal nature of the intrusion required even less suspicion than that.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.037" offset="1235571">Well, it is difficult to say whether Terry -- Terry enunciated a standard on the facts of Terry and held that what was known to the officer justified the action that he took in Terry.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.651" offset="1281964">I think that the Court's ensuing cases have made clear that the inquiry is a measurement of the degree of intrusion involved in the particular police action weighed against the degree of suspicion, the basis for the officer's action in the law enforcement needs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.205" offset="5996231">In fact, he is asked to recite in specific words the words that he used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.007" offset="6019427">Now, let me turn briefly to the question of whether what happened here was a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.170" offset="6052028">The position of respondent and of the ACLU essentially is that when a police officer approaches someone whom he finds suspicious and asks that person questions, that ought to be presumptively a seizure in the absence of a statement to the individual that they have a right to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.551" offset="6145546">Now, as Terry makes clear, seizure is an actual restraint upon the individual's freedom to walk away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.812" offset="6174595">Accordingly, we agree with Professor LaFave's analysis of the problem and we quote from him in our brief, that this kind of encounter is only properly deemed a seizure if the officer is engaged in some additional conduct beyond the approach and the inquiry, whether by action or by statement that would indicate to the individual that his freedom of movement has been curtailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.020" offset="6271457">Now, the Court has not squarely decided this issue, but we do think Terry indicates the Court's view on it, and I refer to Footnote 16 in Terry, where the Court, in talking about whether the initial contact between the officer and Terry at which he walked up to him and asked him for identification was a seizure, saying that it didn't have to, wasn't going to decide that, the Court said obviously not all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involve seizures of persons, only when the officer by means of physical force or show of authority has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a seizure has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.319" offset="6448671">We cannot tell with any certainty upon this record whether any such seizure took place here prior to Officer McFadden's initiation of physical contact for the purpose of searching Terry for weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.533" offset="6489527">Now, of course, if the view of respondent were correct, they could have told perfectly well that there had been a seizure because --</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.657" offset="6985958">But in Martinez-Fuerte what was involved was an initial stop at a check-point followed by a referral to a secondary inspection area based essentially on the officer's suspicion and nothing more than an indication of Mexican ancestry on the part of the passengers of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.633" offset="7057951">That unquestionably is a seizure of the occupants of the car within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and yet the Supreme Court upheld that on the basis of suspicion that they said was not to satisfy the requirements for stopping an automobile in Brignoni-Ponce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.337" offset="7128691">Now, in this case what everyone may conclude about the suspicion that existed on the part of the officers, I think there was a great deal more than the suspicion that was considered satisfactory in Martinez-Fuerte.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.326" offset="7212701">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.341" offset="7224717">I am Randall Karfonta, representing Sylvia Mendenhall in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.029" offset="7243525">Initially, I would briefly like to clarify some of the facts on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.025" offset="7263483">First of all, the agents were looking for basically any citizen to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.984" offset="7283336">There was no information that any specific heroin was coming to Detroit, nor were they looking for any specific individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.782" offset="7318549">As far as the lack of baggage factor goes, a close reading of the record will show that at the hearing the agent didn't contend that this was of continuing significance; rather, the government has continued to argue it in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.853" offset="7378735">As far as the detention in the office, the record contains no written or oral consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.428" offset="7409037">It is absolutely barren of any consent to going to that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.001" offset="7435368">Once Sylvia Mendenhall was in that office, she was asked to take a seat and then for the first time the matter of a search was raised. The matter of a strip search was first raised after the consent was allegedly given, and at that point Sylvia Mendenhall said I have to catch my plane, I've got got to leave, and she was told that she would be free to leave if she had nothing on her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.252" offset="7564413">She kept repeating that and, as the testimony states, then began taking her clothes off, taking her time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.372" offset="7596910">As to the matter of time that was raised during the prosecutor's argument, the time as is reflected on the record was five to six minutes until the consent to search was given, but the record does not reflect how long it took to call the female officer for the female officer to come to the office and for the actual search itself to begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.897" offset="7694921">Our first contention is that the defendant was arrested within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when she was in that private locked DEA office for the purpose of a search of her body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.299" offset="7748524">The entire transaction, the design and execution was for an investigatory seizure to search Sylvia Mendenhall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.252" offset="7784364">A reasonable person in those circumstances could only believe that they were under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.335" offset="7808711">She was not told she was free to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.611" offset="7817801">She was not asked when her plane was leaving, and the setting of the office itself makes that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.676" offset="7846118">The facts in this case are nothing like any of the stop facts this Court has discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.133" offset="7875897">I believe as far as this Court has gone was in United States v.

            <text syncTime="3844.547" offset="15481605">Yes, I have a couple of minor points and one I think of fairly major importance that I hope to be able to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.520" offset="15509504">The first point is on the question of where she was going, whether she was going on American Airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.082" offset="15531656">You are being asked to take judicial notice of facts for the first time in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.852" offset="15550777">I think there is a lot of difficulty with doing that in a case where the respondent's own lawyer in the District Court was not aware of this supposedly obvious factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.533" offset="15589543">Indeed, everybody conceded in the District Court that she was changing her flight and the whole case was argued on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.435" offset="15613158">There was no exploration on cross-examination, and the Fourth Amendment does not require that he be right in his belief that she was changing flights but only that he have some basis that would add to his suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.768" offset="15666448">Now, with regard to Brown v. Texas, it has absolutely no bearing on this case because in Brown v. Texas, Brown was convicted of failing to give his identification after having been lawfully stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.584" offset="15717752">It would have availed the State of Texas nothing to argue that he was not stopped in that case, since that would have been a confession of error, and the Court makes quite clear in its opinion that since the conviction can be sustained only if he was lawfully stopped, the question is whether the facts known justified a stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.701" offset="15794134">There was no occasion in Brown to discuss whether the initial encounter was a stop.</text>
