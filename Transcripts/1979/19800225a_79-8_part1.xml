            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="70.718" offset="386278">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.429" offset="405086">This case is here on the government's petition to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.794" offset="430582">At issue is the construction and the constitutionality of the Federal Magistrates Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.913" offset="451062">The respondent, who has previously been convicted of numerous crimes, was indicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on one count of unlawful receiving a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.579" offset="497664">Prior to trial, the respondent moves to suppress various statements he had made to the Chicago police at the time of his arrest and also to federal agents on two subsequent occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.069" offset="535698">The respondent claimed that these statements were inadmissible as a matter of both Fourth and Fifth Amendment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.667" offset="566000">In accordance with section 636(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Magistrates Act, the District Court designated a magistrate to conduct and evidentiary hearing regarding respondent's pretrial suppression motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.348" offset="616782">Following an extensive hearing, the magistrate made proposed findings of fact, rejecting respondent's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.383" offset="644890">In particular, the magistrate found that the testimony of the federal agents was more credible than that of respondent and he recommended that the motion be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.401" offset="696926">The District Court thereafter, pursuant to section 636(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Magistrates Act, made a "de novo determination" of respondent's motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.333" offset="736737">That is, the District Court made a thorough review of the transcript of the hearing held before the magistrate, the magistrate's report and the submission of the parties, and he thereafter denied the motion to suppress evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.231" offset="792325">Subsequently, the respondent was convicted based on the evidence at the suppression hearing and some stipulated facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.020" offset="823463">On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.387" offset="836942">The court first acknowledged that the proceedings in the District Court had complied with the Federal Magistrates Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.325" offset="864632">The court further found that the Federal Magistrates Act did not violate Article 3 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.908" offset="890964">Nonetheless, the court concluded that the due process clause of the Constitution requires the District Court either to defer to the magistrate's proposed findings of fact or to rehear the testimony itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.203" offset="940178">And since the statute prohibits the deference that the court felt that the due process clause requires, the Court of Appeals sent the case back to the District Court for a second duplicative suppression hearing to be conducted personally by the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.622" offset="1001827">Mr. Levander, what if after the denial of the suppression motion but at the point at the trial of the case, where the government sought to introduce the confession, the defendant had objected and said under Jackson v. Denno, an opinion of this Court, I am entitled to the judge's determination as to whether it is voluntary or nog before it goes to the jury?</text>

            <text syncTime="257.378" offset="1132857">The trial was based on the stipulations and the transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.279" offset="1144456">Well, that is how lots of trials are conducted nowadays, because the defendants don't have any defense if they lose their suppression motion.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="267.425" offset="1173086">But let's suppose we are talking about a defendant who really did have a defense and had an argument to make, not only his confession was involuntary but he had witnesses to put on and an alibi and that sort of thing, do you think that the District Judge would have been required under those circumstances, when the confession was offered at trial, to conduct a hearing and listen in person to the suppression motion?</text>

            <text syncTime="298.416" offset="1297011">Let me understand your question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.151" offset="1311953">In your hypothetical, the defendant moved prior to trial and had a hearing before a magistrate?</text>

            <text syncTime="313.044" offset="1355525">Again, that would be the same thing as this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.603" offset="1365765">Once the magistrate has conducted the hearing and a District Court has made its de novo determination of the motion, that is the end of the ball game.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.794" offset="1418533">That's right, he has had an impartial arbiter evaluate his testimony and thereafter the District Court makes its de novo determination of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.743" offset="1458343">He has gotten more in fact than what Jackson v. Denno requires.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.283" offset="1504528">The evidence as to the -- if it is jury trial, the evidence as to voluntariness goes to the jury, too, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="381.218" offset="1628244">In Jackson v. Denno, of course, the Court held that the jury that determines guilt or innocence is not permitted to make that initial determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.338" offset="1700760">Well, I don't know how you would compare one to the other, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I would say that he is an impartial arbiter, he is not some person off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.423" offset="1737017">He is a federal employee who -- you know, there is no claim in this proceeding that the magistrate misconducted the hearing in any way.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.763" offset="1766379">Well, there is no claim in most proceedings that juries have misbehaved either, and yet Jackson v. Denno says you can't submit a confession to them without --</text>

            <text syncTime="426.014" offset="1807444">In a footnote in Jackson v. Denno and also in Lego v. Twomey, the Court reiterated that you could give it to a jury, it just can't be the same jury that decides guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.071" offset="1843702">In other words, you could have a suppression hearing at which a jury was empaneled and listen to the evidence and made a determination of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.734" offset="1878288">Thereafter at trial you would have to have another jury decide the question of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.731" offset="1898245">The Court made quite clear in both Jackson v. Denno and in Footnote 9, I believe it is, of Lego v. Twomey that it has just got to be a neutral fact-finder, that is the trial judge, another judge or another jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.670" offset="1958013">It just can't be the jury that tries guilt or innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.507" offset="1977448">Well, the theory I think in Jackson v. Denno is that the jury will be misled as to the question of voluntariness because it will look to reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.417" offset="2029066">And since the question of voluntariness does not involve the question of reliability but rather involves solely the question of the policeman's behavior or the constable's conduct, the Court said that due process requires that a neutral fact-finder that is not concerned with guilt or innocence make the determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.309" offset="2168560">The statute divides pretrial matters into two kinds of categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.110" offset="2187786">As to most pretrial matters, which I will call procedural for want of a matter nomenclature, or subsection (a) matters, the magistrate is authorized to "hear and determine the matter," and as to that the District Court makes a review as if it were a court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.599" offset="2249749">That is, it can reverse for errors of law and for findings of fact which are clearly erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.543" offset="2753494">Our position and a critical question on the statutory matter is what is a "de novo determination."</text>
            <text syncTime="668.782" offset="2778467">Our position is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.776" offset="2786513">A de novo determination is a thorough review of the evidence induced before the magistrate, the magistrate's report and submission of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.271" offset="2824443">The respondent's position is not quite so clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.732" offset="2834265">They say that de novo determination means what we say it means some of the time, but other times it means a de novo hearing, and they distinguish and they say that it means that a de novo hearing any time that the credibility of the witness is called into question, in other words any time there is a conflict in testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.344" offset="2904795">But of course in a suppression hearing, and certainly habeas proceedings and all of those kinds of proceedings, virtually every pretrial hearing is going to involve conflicting testimony, so therefore respondent's real position I take it is that in most cases two hearings will be required.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.181" offset="3068113">At the outset, it is quite apparent in our view that the act, that respondent's construction of the act would utterly defeat Congress' purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.573" offset="3101654">Congress enacted the Magistrates Act to relieve the District Courts from the tremendous burden in litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="756.692" offset="3130180">And in particular, Congress said in 1976, when it amended the act, we want magistrates to conduct these kinds of evidentiary hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.474" offset="3161318">To require two hearings in every case would just obviously defeat what Congress sought to do, to relieve the District Courts of pretrial matters so that they could conduct trials and make decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.816" offset="3286601">The act does not say the District Court is required to make a de novo hearing of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.023" offset="3311470">It says it must make a de novo determination of the magistrate's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.636" offset="3329964">This distinction in language makes it clear, it seems to us, that there is not a de novo hearing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.655" offset="3362043">It is simply, on contrast to subsection (a) motions, a kind of review pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.743" offset="3382314">It is not the clearly erroneous pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.288" offset="3388479">It is a de novo determination pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.594" offset="3397778">Moreover, the act itself empowers the District judge to conduct a second hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.869" offset="3418885">Now, if that grant of power be wholly unnecessary, if de novo determination meant de novo hearing, the power would already be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.365" offset="3456815">Obviously Congress thought it meant something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.013" offset="3467473">Finally, where Congress thought it important in the body of the act to require the District Court to make a second hearing or to reheat the testimony, it expressly provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.027" offset="3507493">636(d) talks about contempt proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.096" offset="3519718">When contempt occurs before a magistrate, Congress specifically stated that the District Court must hear the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.809" offset="3546572">Here, however, he only must make a de novo determination, something quite different.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.931" offset="3607071">The legislative history I think answers any questions on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.092" offset="3627760">The original version of the 1976 amendment provided that the District Court would have to rehear the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.943" offset="3655137">Congress rejected this language and said instead of hear de novo, they put in de novo determination, and the legislative history makes clear that that language comes from a Ninth Circuit decision called Campbell v. United States District Court, which is quoted at length and with approval in the House report accompanying the 1976 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.813" offset="3726608">In Campbell, the Court of Appeals concluded that a District Court could designate a magistrate to conduct a suppression hearing and that thereafter the District Court make a de novo determination of the motion, which did not mean that it had to rehear the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.805" offset="3782614">And the report itself, the House report itself states that, and I roughly quote, "use of the words de novo determination is not intended to require the district judge to conduct a new hearing on contested issues," squarely and flatly refuting the respondent's construction of the act.</text>
