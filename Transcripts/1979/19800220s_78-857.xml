            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="12.077" offset="48274">The question in this case is whether the National Labor Relations Act requires Yeshiva University to bargain collectively with school and faculty members.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.292" offset="93100">The dispute arose when the university refused to bargain with a union representing the full-time faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.214" offset="120790">The university contended that faculty members are supervisory and managerial employees and therefore are excluded from the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.026" offset="160078">The National Labor Relations Board disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.568" offset="174184">But the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit refused to enforce the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.764" offset="199053">Concluding that Yeshiva faculty substantially and pervasively operates the enterprise, the Court of Appeals determined that full-time faculty members were managerial employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.480" offset="257881">We agree with this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.755" offset="266971">The record demonstrates that the faculty exercise its authority which is unquestionably managerial.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.290" offset="301140">They effectively determined for example what courses will be offered, when they will be scheduled, to whom they will be taught, and who will be graduated.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.585" offset="346279">They also make recommendation usually accepted as to faculty hiring, tenure, sabbaticals, termination, and promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.985" offset="391837">Faculty members undoubtedly also exercise professional judgment in making these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.028" offset="420049">It is clear however that the decisions reflect the interest and policy of the university as well as the professional interest of the faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.363" offset="461427">Nor can we defer in this case to the expertise of the Board as it made no specific findings of fact and arrived at a conclusion we think is inconsistent with the policy of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.027" offset="520046">Accordingly we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.221" offset="536869">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
