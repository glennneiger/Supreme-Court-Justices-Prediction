            <text syncTime="46.692" offset="292195">Yes sir, but most important, he would have been able to plead payment as indeed we are free to do though not to defeat the award of $17 million, but to determine whether there was a -- a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.231" offset="342350">The Court of Claims in this case was very clear about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.537" offset="355516">They held that although the gratu -- the provisions supplied were not allowable as an offset against the award, they were to be taken into account in determining whether there was fair dealing or whether Congress acted in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.438" offset="431167">Now, whether Congress acted in good faith depends on whether at the time the value of the provisions was sought to be somewhat equivalent to the value of the Black Hills.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.336" offset="482785">The value of the Black Hills is a matter which a century later gave rise to enormous controversy where the Commission experts varied between less than $5 million to more than $25 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.764" offset="532522">The Commission after months of hearings and with years to ponder came up with the figure of $17.1 million, but Congress cannot be faulted if in 1877 it did not accurately know that value.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.646" offset="591976">It would still have been acting in good faith if it had somewhat undervalued the value of that territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.714" offset="620293">It certainly cannot be faulted because in fact its promise was over generous and as to that promise and its implementation, my learned friend has suggested that the figure of $43 million is confected.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.877" offset="684972">It comes out of the Government Accounting Office reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.173" offset="702109">It is a finding of the Court of Claims in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.990" offset="725410">It was increased by an admission of former counsel in the 1950s.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.506" offset="755399">It is not a figure taken out of the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.780" offset="768564">It is well-known and was then well-known that this obligation would exceed some million dollars a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.444" offset="795209">Congress had deleted the limitation to 10 years obviously anticipating that it might need to be continued longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.680" offset="832094">At the very least, Congress undertook a very serious substantial obligation which was fully fulfilled and it ought not now to be said to be to have been acting in such bad faith as to constitute an unconstitutional taking.</text>
