            <text syncTime="109.908" offset="543013">When it was heard on a wiretap and then a green jaguar, he was alleged to have delivered $50 or $100 worth of drugs and was observed at the situs of the tap.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.731" offset="598288">The young lady who owned the car was summoned to the stands subpoenaed to the US Attorney's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.240" offset="616364">At this point, there were no indictments or criminal charges pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.869" offset="630888">She was asked “who drives the car?”</text>
            <text syncTime="133.995" offset="639352">She said, “The only other person that drives it is her male friend, Winfield Roberts and he's right outside the door.”</text>
            <text syncTime="140.638" offset="665893">Impressed with their good fortune, the district attorney and the police officers there invited him in to discuss the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.672" offset="690030">And, as the District Attorney Mr. McSorley said, as soon as you walked in the door, the defendant or potential defendant, he was not a defendant at that time, was read his Miranda rights pursuant to the PD 47 which is a compilation of those rights, except the one that indicated he was under arrest because, clearly, he was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.975" offset="771323">He was advised he had the right to remain silent anything he said --</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan M. Palmer</label>
            <text syncTime="183.437" offset="837151">-- so to speak, and he was told that “If you want to answer any questions now with a lawyer present, you have the right to stop answering in any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.924" offset="875081">You also have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to a lawyer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="196.032" offset="887515">This is standard PD 47 warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.661" offset="897964">Now, as the district attorney testified at this hearing at transcript 38, he said, “The petitioner fully understood his rights and the trial court agreed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="208.802" offset="938611">Now, initially, the petitioner was vague about any involvement in the case until an actual tape of his voice was played indicating when his own voice, the jaguar, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.395" offset="992946">At that point, he admitted what was on the tape to the extent of, on two occasions, he delivered drugs with $50 or $100 to this Charles B. Thornton in a jaguar.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.893" offset="1042996">At that point, the Prosecutor Preston said, “Well, where did you get the drugs from?”</text>
            <text syncTime="241.134" offset="1067865">And, as the testimony indicated, at that point, police officers testified, at transcript 12, the petitioner was -- gave an evasive answer, “He refused to tell us.”</text>
            <text syncTime="250.059" offset="1103600">The prosecutor testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.700" offset="1110183">He clamped up and the conversation ended because he wouldn't go any further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.060" offset="1139649">He was advised to come back in two or three days and think it over.”</text>
            <text syncTime="262.150" offset="1151979">He did so and he said, “I can't help you anymore,” and he left.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.296" offset="1172564">Now, obviously, the defendant who was not advised by counsel at that point, he was not under duress, only admitted that which the Government knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.186" offset="1212165">When he heard his own voice on the tapes to deliveries, he said, “Yes, I was involved in that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="281.747" offset="1230346">As to any further involvement, any conspiracies of the persons who may be involved, he relied and, pursuant to his warning to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.928" offset="1267127">And, indeed, this is the very consequence envisioned by this Court in the Miranda opinion where it indicated that if the individual indicates in any manner at any time prior to or during questioning, he wants to rely on these warnings, rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.416" offset="1328985">At this point, he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.661" offset="1349987">This is precisely what this petitioner did.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.439" offset="1365138">He was then indictment, arrested and indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.115" offset="1375796">He was arrested about a month later, indicated about two months after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.092" offset="1395754">Here, again, after the indictment on three or four occasions, now, there's a transcript -- the remand transcript of January 28, 1977 that was sent to this Court also in December 5th, alluded to in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.426" offset="1445073">On three or more occasions, personally, the prosecutor spoke to his attorney for cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.965" offset="1467225">He wanted his cooperation to testify in open court against the codefendant and to identify the other people he was involved with, the places, locations, the full conspiracy, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.516" offset="1517484">And, as the prosecutor testified at the remand hearing, “This was rejected out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.675" offset="1538069">There was never any indication that Mr. Roberts would assist us and, indeed, throughout the course of this three-year-litigation."</text>
            <text syncTime="366.484" offset="1569311">Mr. Roberts, the petitioner, consistently relied on his right to remain silent until, at the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor urged this noncooperation as a basis for increasing penalty or, as a sentencing aggravating factor and the court relying thereon and enunciated this as one of the reasons for the consecutive sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.519" offset="1661471">At that point, Mr. Roberts, the petitioner was penalized for relying on his Fifth Amendment rights which the Government concedes, at brief 37, it could not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.607" offset="1709850">The court that is could not so penalize him.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.270" offset="1720404">Now, the Government, in its brief, argues a waiver theory that this was never actually urged by petitioner during the course of the three years or the sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.363" offset="1772857">He says, at page 35 of the brief, petitioner as counsel never said that non-cooperation was based on constitutional rights and in cri -- and, immunity was never sought by petitioner or his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.792" offset="1830536">And, further, goes on to say the, point two, that, at no time during the sentencing hearing that, in fact, counsel elude to Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.127" offset="1867839">Now, these are important considerations and we're going to answer them fully, as we have in the brief, we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.594" offset="1901798">Insofar as the three-year phase --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="450.956" offset="1907231">But this isn't true -- true Mr. Palmer, that there was a colloquy at least before the trial where you -- where, in defense counsel, agreed to withdraw their motion to recues Judge Pratt if he would agree to concur in sentences.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allan_m_palmer" startTime="465.248" stopTime="649.549">
            <label>Mr. Allan M. Palmer</label>
            <text syncTime="465.248" offset="1964387">We filed a memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.848" offset="1970761">We don't -- previously had a -- we filed a memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.335" offset="1984763">There was a mandamus petition we set to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.213" offset="2000227">“We'd ask you to recuse yourself because, under the Greg opinion of this Court, you've already sentenced the man, you've heard the -- you've read the presentence report.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.425" offset="2033037">Out of an abundance of caution to preserve this issue of fairness, the preservation, the appearance of fairness, we think the Court should recuse itself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="490.831" offset="2066683">And, in fact, if the Court does recuse itself in the -- well, it didn't recuse itself, we said.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.013" offset="2107434">But, if it did not recuse itself, if it gave concurring sentences, we would withdraw that claim, that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.464" offset="2133243">In a footnote, we did indicate that upon consent and advice of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.979" offset="2163336">Now, in many cases, petitioners arrest to cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.366" offset="2180786">It happens all the time in District Courts, and it is understood by all experienced counsel, defense counsel, that if the man says no, obviously he's relying on his Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.340" offset="2232717">He does not have to confess, say anything to the Government at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.669" offset="2254033">And, indeed, in this case, the petitioner was brought -- not brought into court during the three-year-period and said, “Well, while I have you not confessed late at the scheme for the benefit of the prosecutor?”</text>
            <text syncTime="549.622" offset="2301889">It was understood by the prosecutor and defense counsel that, by not cooperating, the defendant simply relied on his right to remain silent as he had throughout the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.512" offset="2349432">And so, when the Government says that the defense never came forward during these three years and said, “Well, we're relying on the Fifth Amendment as such” or that “He never asked for cooperation,” that argument is long -- the brief in that regard is long in argument and short on experience because it is generally understood that there is no right for the Government to compel this incriminating statement from the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.697" offset="2458206">And, furthermore, we're not familiar with any instance where or a general practice whereas the defendant who says, “I would like immunity prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.665" offset="2494046">Please give us immunity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="598.973" offset="2499271">The Government knows what to -- knows what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.441" offset="2513168">If it wants to, it could put the man before the grand jury, if he claims his Fifth Amendment right, then give him immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.097" offset="2535737">It's not up to the defendant to ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.048" offset="2547545">It's up for the prosecution to confer it if it deems fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.543" offset="2569592">Now, at the time of the sentencing or prior thereto, from day one, June 13, 1975 when the defendant walked into the prosecutor's office, through the morning of the sentencing hearing, not one time in writing or otherwise did the Government ever urge noncooperation as a sentencing factor for aggravation or as any factor at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.767" offset="2762480">On these facts, it is a one-way street in the sense that the man is consciously giving up right to self-incrimination if he cooperates.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.365" offset="2800828">In narcotic cases especially, there's a danger to one's safety, there's a danger to one's life, the -- his family, and he consciously gives up these factors, these rights, the right to silence, the right not to endanger himself or his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.762" offset="2858402">And, for that reason, when a man cooperates, he does so voluntarily, fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.044" offset="2883584">Courts have indeed given benefit to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.406" offset="2896959">But at the Congress, it's not true because if he doesn't cooperate, there are many valid reasons such as, in this case, his reliance on the right of self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.665" offset="2934053">Well, he did not cooperation -- did not cooperate and, in fact, Judge Lombard, in considering the issue in the Ramos and DiGiovanni case, a most experienced federal appellate judge, has indicated that it is a one-way street in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.179" offset="5788087">Where is that report?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allan_m_palmer" startTime="1421.404" stopTime="1751.771">
            <label>Mr. Allan M. Palmer</label>
            <text syncTime="1421.404" offset="5789027">Well, it was based on (a) my experience of 17 years in the District Court, having conferred with drug agents, etcetera, and the Government conceded it at the sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.475" offset="5833226">It was never controverted in the Court of Appeals and, indeed, not controverted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.843" offset="5858722">In fact, the prosecutor said that, in asking for consecutive sentences at appendix 34 and 45, we realize we're going against custom and practice in this courthouse and I'd like to explain why we're doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.823" offset="5922670">It's not to appear as to sigh and agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.201" offset="5932178">And then, he launched for three pages the argument that this lack of cooperation should move the District Court to do what no other District Court had ever done before, that is, impose consecutive sentences for two telephone counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.442" offset="6001142">Now, after he allocuted, the Court turned to us and said, “Do you want to make a response, Mr. Palmer?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.294" offset="6044505">and, remember, at this point, the issue had not been joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.145" offset="6055999">Of course, the Government had never, until that moment, urged this is a sentencing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.011" offset="6079404">And, for a brief paragraph, we de -- when you're dealing with an allocution, you're trying to persuade somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.599" offset="6105736">It's not a legal argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.257" offset="6112423">And, we said to the Court, “Well, apparently in this situation, the codefendant Thornton got probation."</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.489" offset="6145337">This defendant is before the Court, he isn't -- he hasn't cooperated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.965" offset="6159235">The defendant -- the Government is obviously mad at him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.631" offset="6169893">Let's give him the time we can, as much as we can, while we've got him before us and then, I went on to another matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.893" offset="6198941">And, in these circumstances, we don't think we can be faulted for not raising the issue having -- we never thought about the issue, the implications of the right to remain silent, the Miranda warnings, etcetera when Courts of Appeal are -- appeals are divided on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.871" offset="6262888">In fact, that's why we're here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.290" offset="6272502">So, we can't be faulted for not raising at that time and, indeed, the issue only came into the case when the judge, in imposing sentence, said, “That is one of the factors I'm relying upon.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.132" offset="6315865">After that, the case went on appeal and we researched the law, presented it to the Court of Appeals, and the case ultimately wound its way here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.065" offset="6367587">Now, since the record below was silent, in effect, as to the reasons for the lack of cooperation, other than this Fifth Amendment issue which is clearly there, it was impermissible for the Court to penalize lack of cooperation when lack of cooperation could just as easily have been, as Judge Lombard said in his opinions, from fear of harm, danger to himself, or his family, or other like reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.270" offset="6488482">In other words, there's no reason to say that failure to cooperate on these facts was because the man was not amenable to rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.597" offset="6529755">Now, there's a further consideration here, and that is the fact that, in this case, the prosecutor urged consecutive penalties because petitioner failed to cooperate over the entire course of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.597" offset="6581791">At appendix 36, he said, “Throughout the long process that has occurred some-June of 1975, when he first came into my office, up to today, he still has refused to cooperate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.344" offset="6628707">Now, at the stage where the defendant was in the prosecutor's office and he refused to cooperate, the defendant was then penalized in part because, at that point, unrepresented by counsel, he didn't confess everything the Government wanted to know, indicate where he got the drugs from and things of that nature, and we think that is clearly impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.857" offset="6718777">Secondly, between the -- the indictment and the plea, as we understand it, the defendant has pleaded not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.681" offset="6766111">He has no duty to confess, cooperate with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.787" offset="6778546">He's Fifth Amendment rights have not been waived in any shape or form and, yet, the defendant was penalized in this case, during this phase of this case also, because he never came and said, “Prosecutor, let -- I want to lay my soul bare to you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.219" offset="6840299">I think that's impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.558" offset="6845628">And, in line with the question that Justice Stevens asked, for example, under Grayson, we think a judge could probably say to a defendant “Mr. Defendant, you're going to testify.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.358" offset="6892753">The Supreme Court has said, “If you do and do so falsely, and you're convicted, I'm going to take that into account when I impose sentence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.660" offset="6922010">But, we don't think that, prior to the disposition of the case, the defendant can be brought into the courtroom and the judge say to him, “Now, Mr. Defendant, you know, I've heard you haven't cooperated in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.808" offset="6978644">The Government wants you to testify against your codefendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.870" offset="6990869">You haven't done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.043" offset="6995571">You haven't indicated who you got your drugs from, and I think that's something that should be done and, if you don't do it, when -- if you're convicted and the sentencing comes about, I'm going to penalize you for that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.763" offset="7038412">I think that is totally impermissible, coercive, collides with fundamental rights of a defendant in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.863" offset="7070804">And, for these reasons, we think the sentencing in this case on these facts was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.601" offset="7093791">Now, I have five minutes to go and I'd like to reserve those for rebuttal.</text>
