            <text syncTime="18.911" offset="178970">The Stuyvesant was the recipient under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, so two kinds of financial assistance in its construction; one was a guaranteed loans in the amount of $30 million and the subsidy of $27.2 million which is designed to equalize the cost of between building that vessel and a domestic shipyard and what it would have cost to build that vessel in a foreign shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.708" offset="274160">And, as a result, the contract of CDS contained a provision required by Section 506 of the statute that the owner of the vessel shall agree to operate that vessel in the foreign trade except, incidentally, on the foreign travel and accept temporarily upon the consent of the Commission and with a limit of six months out of every year of its economic life.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.972" offset="371231">In each instance, a pro rata repayment of the subsidy would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.985" offset="391293">Between the time that that contract was entered into in 1972 and 1977, all foreign trade opportunities for the vessel were nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.727" offset="430268">The Arab oil embargo and the subsequent downswing in the international market had rendered there are no need for this vessel in the foreign trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.736" offset="462346">At the same time, however, there was a domestic market that had developed, the carriage of oil from Valdez, Alaska, at the end of the Alaska pipe line around to the west side of the Panama Canal for throughput to the east coast.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.828" offset="990647">I think the Judge Bazelon indicated that he would require that to be paid back.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.106" offset="1015829">Actually the -- and the Solicitor General has said in his papers here that the Secretary would now require that interest, in addition, to be paid back, the interest for that time period, but in terms of -- in the case, the original decision by the Secretary was not to require that interest and that decision was reaffirmed on the remand.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.688" offset="1194088">I suppose you wouldn't -- I suppose you wouldn't challenge the idea that the payment of interest might be a reasonable or sensible administrative decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.978" offset="1227316">I suspect, Your Honor, that's a request that we would not refuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.873" offset="1238915">If that was to be the position of the Secretary that, now, that would be required, our clients would acknowledge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.332" offset="1264724">The Secretary did analyze the financial aspects of it in remand to show that it did not result in any competitive disadvantage to the Plaintiffs, but we would not quarrel with that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.621" offset="1313834">The question of statutory interpretation, her power to make this amendment and to accept subsidy repayment involves the first instance of the language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.230" offset="1352286">And, Section 504 gives the power to contract in the CDS area and gives with it necessarily the power to amend and terminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.425" offset="1389066">In addition, Section 207 of the Act specifically gives the Secretary powers to contract consistent with the purposes of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 and specifically, further, to protect and to preserve or to improve a collateral position.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.966" offset="1451238">We submit that the exercise of the power, if you look to the circumstances of this case, fully met each and every one of the purposes of the Act set forth in Section 101, as well as fully met a desire to preserve and protect and improve the Secretary's collateral position.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.869" offset="1514872">It met the purposes of the Act because the shipyard was benefited by the ability to sell the vessel and to have financial commitments recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.090" offset="1555728">The vessel itself is a viable vessel, instead of going into layup, it's a viable vessel with American built, American owned, and operated by American crew available for any national need.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.014" offset="1599404">The trade area itself was in need of further tonnage and still is.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.148" offset="1615914">There was an under supply of this type of shipyard tonnage to carry the Alaskan oil and, therefore, the Secretary was able to address a need in the trade by permitting the domestic use of this tanker.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.126" offset="1663875">Furthermore, her collateral position was protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.530" offset="1677458">First of all, the Secretary will receive back $27.2 million that, obviously, would not otherwise have to be repaid since at the outset it was a direct subsidy grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.861" offset="1718836">In addition, there are $28.6 million of the proceeds of the sale went immediately to discharge loans on -- which the Secretary guaranteed under EDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.515" offset="1765439">So, $28.6 million went directly to discharge those guaranteed loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.975" offset="1787277">In addition, the $30 million of Title 11 assistance which was guaranteed loans, which was increased to additional $30 million at the closing, received an improved collateral position because the vessel was a viable vessel in a trade earning charter rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.992" offset="1855300">We submit, Your Honor, that this -- the statutory construction question is aided by the principle that the Secretary's interpretation would be given great weight if it is consistent with the purposes of the Act and should be accorded unless there are compelling indications that it's wrong, particularly whereas here, the Secretary's interpretation has been longstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.473" offset="1945266">It was first done in 1964 in the Grace Line decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.524" offset="1961462">It's been consistently spoken about by the Secretary ever since, both in terms of other, although infrequent, applications for this relief and its messages to Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.256" offset="2176397">And, the power is well known in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.860" offset="2190817">It's been spoken of before Congress by industry spokesman, as well as the legislators themselves and this particular power survived the amendment of the statute in 1970 and has been specifically been called to the attention of Congress twice in 1972 and again in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.060" offset="2263646">And, I think the 1972 history is most important because in 1972 Congress specifically enacted positive legislation to facilitate the Secretary in granting trade release restrictions -- release the trade restrictions and repayment of the subsidy because it amended Title 11 to provide guaranteed financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.008" offset="2351417">In the cases of an applicant who seeks to repay like $27.2 million to gain trade restriction release.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.768" offset="2382451">As ultimately enacted, the bill was broadened to include financing of any repayment of subsidy, including the more common repayment pursuant to the temporary release authorized by Section 506, but it's clear that the Grace Line precedent was called to the attention of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.845" offset="2450787">Congress not only did not disapprove of it but specifically granted positive legislation facilitating its exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.775" offset="2482448">Now, in light of these aspects and canons of statutory construction, there is not in this case any compelling indication, either in the language of the Act or its history or its purposes, that the Secretary's interpretation is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.429" offset="2541066">The language which the Plaintiffs rely upon is Section 506 of the Act which provides for when a vessel can enter the domestic trade while it retains its subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.183" offset="2588087">We submit that that section, by its very language, has no application to a vessel such as the Stuyvesant which has repaid its subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.798" offset="2622568">There's nothing in that section that precludes the Secretary from exercising the power here, nor is there anything in the legislative history that suggests this action is contrary to the intent of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.153" offset="2668022">In 1936, Senator Hugo Black, at that time, issued the report which formed the basis of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.956" offset="2691218">His report to Congress indicated that the Secretary should have this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.357" offset="2708773">Each of the framers of the statute indicated that the Secretary should have this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.789" offset="2730506">And, the 1936 Act itself contained language which described this power in Section 506 wherein it indicated that the Secretary could do this upon her consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.119" offset="2783796">The Plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals rely heavily on the 1938 legislative history wherein that descriptive language which I have described was removed from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.506" offset="2829354">It was deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.288" offset="2836564">This, however, was done and the legislative history speaks only to it being done in the context of addressing a totally separate problem whether or not there would be required for any and all partial returns, any and all temporary returns the repayment of subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.326" offset="2904691">The -- Chairman Kennedy, who presented the amendment, said that there was an ambiguity in the 1936 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.753" offset="2934366">The only ambiguity in that statute, upon analysis, is that it seem -- it appears to permit the subsidized vessel to return to the trade for a period of three months and not have to remit any pro rata share of the previous subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.228" offset="3000299">This section was entirely rewritten in 1938 and, as rewritten, it makes the matter of trade restrictions a contractual term to which the owner shall agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.824" offset="3054634">We submit to the Court there is nothing in the legislative history that suggests that that omission of the language was done with the intention of depriving the Secretary of the power she's exercised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.176" offset="3100087">Not one word of such intent was -- is in the legislative history and, indeed, the people from the industry, who spoke about the amendment at the time, considered the amendment to increase the opportunity for competition between subsidized vessels and nonsubsidized vessels, rather than decreasing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.544" offset="3277511">That was found to be an inadequate and improper way of subsidizing vessels for the foreign trade.</text>

            <text syncTime="1191.167" offset="4868054">The Government commenced its jurisdictional argument by filing briefs in this Court which almost didn't address the issue of Rule 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.398" offset="4909014">The initial Government briefs on the jurisdiction were all addressed to the finality issue as that concept is understood under 28 U.S.C., 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.828" offset="4954676">In our reply briefs, we focus the argument on Rule 54 (b) because it was a Rule 54 (b) order that was entered by the District Court and because our complaint so clearly asked for relief more than the mere barring of the Stuyvesant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.051" offset="5031581">The Government initially made its final order argument purely on the supposition that the only relief that the Plaintiffs below had asked for was the barring of the Stuyvesant, and the Government said “you had two theories for that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.130" offset="5095842">You had a theory that the -- there was no power to wave the Stuyvesant into the domestic trades and you had a theory that if there was power, the competitive effect was such that the power shouldn't be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.657" offset="5158013">And, we said “no, that isn't our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.306" offset="5168567">You've rewritten our complaint.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.972" offset="5175254">What our complaint said was that the Stuyvesant should not be in the domestic trades because the Secretary has no power and, for other reasons, they were claims of violations under the Administrative Procedure Act, but we also said that the Secretary has no power to waive any vessel built with subsidy into the domestic trades.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.864" offset="5258846">And, we asked for a declaratory judgment to that effect and we asked for an injunction to that effect, and we referred in our complaint to the Bay Ridge which is the sister ship of the Stuyvesant, built by the same interests, nearing completion as to which we allege that if the power to waive the Section 506 bar were upheld for the Stuyvesant, that they would be a similar exercise for the Bay Ridge because the Bay Ridge was also built with subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.950" offset="5383189">They were-- the same government collateral at risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.453" offset="5397191">There was heavy government loan guarantees from the Economic Development Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.611" offset="5417775">And, we asked for an injunction barring the exercise of the waiver power for the Bay Ridge and for any other vessel ever built with construction differential subsidy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1451.960" offset="5911176">So, the Stuyvesant could have been barred for reasons going to issues involved in the remand, but the general injunction against waiver of the power for any vessel could only be granted upon the determination as to statutory authority and, that was the determination made by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.380" offset="5988916">So that once the District Court decided that the Secretary had the disputed authority, the issue as to our entitlement for an injunction, as to the Bay Ridge and all other vessels in that class was finally and irrevocably decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.984" offset="6175326">I think that we finally convinced the Government that our complaint said what we said it said instead of what they said it said because, on the reply briefs, the Government moved away from the claim -- from the contention that we only advance one claim for relief which was to bar the Stuyvesant, and the Government said that we had no right to ask for anything other than the barring of the Stuyvesant because we weren't presenting the judiciary with the case of controversy under Article 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.864" offset="6306879">And, the reason for that was said to be that we were asking for something that wasn't concrete.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.318" offset="7460655">Petitioners' statutory construction rests upon the conception that this statute establishes a quid pro quo relationship and that's the key.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.684" offset="7502137">That's the theme that the statute carries out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.588" offset="7513736">If subsidy is retained, there is a restriction against trading -- domestic trading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.432" offset="7541112">Once subsidy is returned, it is said that the restriction dissolves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.713" offset="7566190">We think that that isn't what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.103" offset="7579773">While there is some quid pro quo relationship, it is not an open-ended quid pro quo relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.797" offset="7606523">The statute says that subsidy is given for operation in foreign trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.371" offset="7628884">The statute has two exceptions to that; incidental domestic trading and domestic trading, purely domestic trading for no longer than six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.868" offset="7674859">If those two exceptions -- if the vessel engages in those two exceptions, the vessel must return subsidy pro re nata, that is the extent of the quid pro quo relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.587" offset="7717700">The opportunity to engage in trading other than foreign is limited, but there is no open-ended statutory scheme whereby a vessel operator can decide to go into any trade other than the ones that he's -- that subsidy was given for merely by repaying subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.905" offset="7798993">Now, Petitioners, in effect, acknowledge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.862" offset="7806830">They don't say that “well, you can go into any incidental trade, for example, other than the enumerated four incidental trades.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.688" offset="7834102">They don't say you can go into domestic trade for eight months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.929" offset="7851133">They say there's only one other, one-third example where you can go into where the quid pro quo relationship is carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.740" offset="7890317">And, that third example is, they say, that if you return all the subsidy or the unamortized subsidy at any point during a vessel's life, then the restriction just dissolves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.471" offset="7933262">Now, the first two quid pro quo relationships are found directly in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.401" offset="7953011">The third one is not found in the statute, but the Petitioners say that's okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.660" offset="7974013">It should be implied into the statute and the reason it should be implied into the statute is because it carries out the quid pro quo theme, but the quid pro quo theme itself is a concoction, we submit, of petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.847" offset="8026781">There is no general quid pro quo theme and, indeed, they acknowledge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.130" offset="8043917">Moreover, the fact that there are two instances in which a vessel built with subsidy can engage in the in -- other than foreign trades upon a repayment of subsidy clearly doesn't imply this third quid pro quo relationship that the petitioners have concocted for the reason that it was the very category of instances that unquestionably was taken out of the Act in 1938 when the statute was rewritten.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.467" offset="8165230">All parties here agree that the 1936 Act, the Act as originally enacted, had a Section 506 that might be interpreted as establishing precisely these three quid pro quo relationships, but in 1938, unquestionably, that third quid pro quo came out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.693" offset="8246105">Now petitioners here spend a lot of time on the 1936 Act, but the 1936 Act isn't the law anymore.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen N. Shulman</label>
            <text syncTime="2320.816" offset="9386611">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.396" offset="9408972">I would like to pick up one or two points with regard to the jurisdictional question that strike me as still hanging a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.499" offset="9453380">One was that Mr. Justice White asked whether or not there was still a case or controversy or there would still be a case or controversy vis-à-vis Seatrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.418" offset="9497057">And, previously to that, there had been questions raised as to what will happen if there were 15 or 16 ships in the wings, I believe, Mr. Justice Stevens raised that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.921" offset="9543032">The important point to remember is that the Stuyvesant itself was standing in the wings because with the only relief that could be gotten, injunctively, given the District Court's order, what you will have was an injunction against the Stuyvesant then based upon the competitive conditions then and there could have been a new attempt, 30 days later, to put the Stuyvesant in again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.153" offset="9652015">So that, the Stuyvesant itself was waiting in the wings to be entered again into domestic trade when the petition -- when the respondents had been denied a permanent injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.534" offset="9701543">I would like also to advert to the point that Mr. Levander made suggesting that following a remand proceeding before the Department of Commerce, it would have been possible to question the standing of the -- what li -- then of the plaintiffs' to bring the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.710" offset="9782209">And, I would say, one, it's a strange procedure indeed that if you are remanded for a determination of competitive impact and there's a finding of no competitive impact, you thereby lose your standing to attack or to review the finding of no competitive impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.601" offset="9845739">And, quite apart from that, it is certainly true that a two-year-charter of the Shell ship is which what -- which is what happened, does not take care of 20 years of injury when the Stuyvesant is permanently waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.604" offset="9913762">Now, the question came up, Mr. Chief Justice Burger raised the question about the similarity between this case and the Chase Manhattan Bank financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.273" offset="9984502">And then, Mr. Justice White raised the point that you might be able to pay back the Chase Manhattan Bank and that Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out that you might need a prepayment requirement, but that the Secretary might not be able to be forced to take back CDS. Instead, the Secretary would have to make some findings before she could take back CDS.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.158" offset="10088051">Now, the only place where there are any findings suggested at all that the Secretary might have to make is in the opinion of Judge Richie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.307" offset="10124622">The statute doesn't set forth any findings for the Secretary to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.477" offset="10141236">The reason why the statute doesn't set forth any findings for the Secretary to make is because there never was a thought that there would be a permanent payback of CDS.</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.137" offset="10195884">The finding is that it is necessary or appropriate to the purposes of the Act, and that is one of the reasons why Chairman Kennedy raised the question in 1938 with regard to the ambiguity because there was absolutely no standard suggested other than the three-month standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.038" offset="10279476">Now, the -- finally, I would like to make this -- the point in response to Mr. Justice Stevens' question with respect to whether or not a one-time statute with a one-time contract with restrictions would be amendable by the contracting party to which Mrs. Klein answered “No, it would not be,” and I certainly want to endorse everything that Mrs. Klein says before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.386" offset="10400893">But I would add one additional point, that the words of Title 506 -- Section 506 are not the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.572" offset="10441644">The words are “every owner.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.287" offset="11260531">That question, Mr. Chief Justice, exactly explains why you deal in temporary transfers in this connection because six months is the kind of discrete unit as to which a rational judgment can be made. One of the things that came out of the remand proceedings was the statement by the Secretary of Commerce that you could not make a projection more than three years into the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.685" offset="11346108">Now, that is some sort of basis on which to allow a ship to engage permanently in foreign trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.129" offset="11367842">It also speaks to why there really are no standards in the Act because Congress never intended that there would be a transfer longer than a six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.832" offset="11410683">There is only one provision in Section 509 which deals with the question of loans as this is -- attempts to be described here or which deals with the question of building for the domestic trade and that's Section 509 which allows the Secretary to make provision for building a ship and then sell it to the purchaser for 12.5% down or 25% down, depending upon what type of ship it is and Section 509 specifically says “no construction deferential subsidy shall be allowed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.908" offset="11575045">With regard to construction deferential subsidy, Title V is perfectly clear that foreign commerce is the sole purpose of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.886" offset="11610885">Section 501 establishes construction deferential subsidy in these words “to aid in the construction of a new vessel to be used in the foreign commerce of the United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.128" offset="11667832">The Secretary of Commerce must determine before approving an application to “the plans and specifications call for a new vessel which will meet the requirements of the foreign commerce of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.705" offset="11718196">She has to determine “that the plans will aid in the promotion and development of such commerce” and Section 506, as I pointed out before, is a continuing prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.746" offset="11774307">It does not apply to the purchaser or the shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.751" offset="11790399">It applies to every owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.871" offset="11850898">It allows only the two indicated domestic uses, one incidental and two for six-month periods and it is the result of an amendment in 1938 at which time, Chairman Kennedy did submit a draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.229" offset="11924250">Chairman Kennedy's draft was enacted and the words that Chairman Kennedy said to describe this were, “if the owner desires to engage in domestic trades other than those enumerated in this section he can do so only by receiving the consent of the Commission.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.993" offset="12199372">The only way that the section can contain an ambiguity is a way that is classically brought out by footnote 2 of the Government's reply brief which says that “a ship that has repaid the subsidy in full and, therefore, no longer enjoys the benefits of that subsidy” is simply not a vessel for which subsidy has been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.567" offset="12297592">If it sells like a ship which has been paid subsidy in order to repay subsidy, it is not a ship as to which subsidy has been paid, I don't know what ship it might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="3095.750" offset="12486405">I think that the statute clearly sets forth the kinds of findings that the Secretary must consider when it says in 207 that she may contract consistent with purposes of the Act, it's also set forth in 101, and to protect and preserve her collateral in which she did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.529" offset="12549517">It would be an unreasonable interpretation of the statute to bind the Secretary where, in the one hand, you give her the power to invest $70 million of the taxpayers' money to say she can never react to the volatile trading circumstances that could concur in the maritime trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.406" offset="12613047">She must have this flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.409" offset="12620988">And, with respect to the 1938 history, Mr. Justice Stewart, the key there is this language that Mr. Kennedy proposed was set at the same time that he says we have no intent to change the original purpose of the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.909" offset="12671039">The original purpose of the section was to remain the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.240" offset="12680338">It clearly countenance the right to have permanent payback, and the fact that, since 1936 and 1938 and, clearly, since 1964, the unsubsidized carriers have realized that this possibility existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.759" offset="12742405">They proposed -- the unsubsidized carriers proposed legislation to permanently ban forever a subsidized vessel from ever coming into the domestic trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.280" offset="12776469">Congress has never done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.129" offset="12783888">Congress has never passed that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.053" offset="12791620">Instead, the statutory scheme permits a half of the life, 10 years of the vessel's life while subsidized, can be spent in direct competition with the subsidized vessels.</text>
