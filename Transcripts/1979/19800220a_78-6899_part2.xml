            <text syncTime="35.642" offset="245948">And then he adds on "If yes, state extent of harm or torture - excluding the actual murdering of the two victims."</text>

            <text syncTime="47.558" offset="293595">He qualifies it, saying there is definitely physical harm to the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.833" offset="318673">And I think the record more than adequately establishes that by virtue of the nature of the wounds to these two victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.762" offset="366425">We have argued and still maintain, consistently maintain, that the Supreme Court of Georgia when it conducts its review, as mandated by our general assembly, carefully goes over the facts to make sure that they are supported by a reasonable doubt, compares them with similar cases, and then also looks to determine whether or not there has been any arbitrariness or discrimination or prejudice in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.025" offset="483453">We have had the argument by petitioner that (b)(7), the seventh aggravating circumstance, is a catch-all.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.312" offset="520652">And yet we have had language by our court in Harris which looked for guidance from the Dixon case.</text>

            <text syncTime="658.304" offset="2736567">I would like to make a couple of points that were raised during the questioning on the Gregg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.952" offset="2771153">The first point that I would like to make is that we take the position very strongly that the Gregg case did not hold Section (b)(7) constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.563" offset="2821622">There was a limiting footnote in that case, footnote No. 51 that referred to limited grant of certiorari in that case, which was limited to the question of whether the death penalty in that case was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.085" offset="2879718">In that case, even though Section (b)(7) was charged, it was not found.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.453" offset="2901138">The Court in responding to the arguments of counsel that Section (b)(7) could apply to any murder, the Court said in part it is of course arguable that any murder involves depravity of mind or an aggravated battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.184" offset="2968116">But this language need not be construed in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.676" offset="2978043">And there is no reason to assume that the Supreme Court of Georgia will adopt such an open-ended construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.593" offset="3081697">Footnote 51 I think indicates that Section (b)(7) was considered in that case only to the extent they considered the attack against the entire system.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.558" offset="3129553">So, I do not believe the Court has really decided that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.621" offset="3145853">But this question is somewhat somewhat narrower because this question is limited to how the court, the Supreme Court of Georgia, has construed Section (b)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="770.122" offset="3183888">They have construed it, as conceded by the state, to really only include outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, and inhuman.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.942" offset="3219101">And another case, I think the Blake v. State case, has said that outrageously and wantonly only modify vile, and they do not modify horrible and inhuman.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.837" offset="3262673">And since the statute is couched in disjunctive terms, that means that a jury would be authorized to find the death penalty in Georgia on a finding that the murder was horrible.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.689" offset="3318157">That is why we say that the open-ended construction that this Court was not willing to assume that the Georgia Supreme Court would adopt has in fact been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.412" offset="3360998">And the facts of this case with reference in the brief to the 42 to 45 other domestic murder cases in Georgia that have been appealed where life sentences were granted, of those there has been no death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.148" offset="3431946">Many of those cases--they are indicated in the brief--are similar on the facts to this Godfrey case, including two or three multiple murders.</text>
