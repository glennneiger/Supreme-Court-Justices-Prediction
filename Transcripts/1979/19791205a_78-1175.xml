            <text syncTime="53.980" offset="319300">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.849" offset="334764">This case which is here on certiorari to the Court of Claims presents the question whether the United States may be sued as a party to an implied contract of bailment when goods seized by the Customs Service are lost while in the custody of Customs.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.979" offset="419297">The Court of Claims granting summary judgment for the United States, held that by reason of a provision in the Federal Tort Claims Act, particularly Subsection (c) of Section 2680, the United States is totally immune from any consequences which follow -- and here's the language of the statute itself -- "the detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of Customs or Excise or any other law enforcement officer."</text>
            <text syncTime="110.536" offset="545520">This reading of Section 2680(c) conflicts with the 1958 holding of the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in a case called Alliance Assurance Company v. United States, which is recorded in 252 Fed. 2d, and also with a very recent construction of that statute by the 9th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.420" offset="629008">And this Court has now granted certiorari to resolve that conflict.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="138.298" offset="656593">Mr. Lewin, it has been my experience in my service here that the Court of Claims is usually astute to seize opportunities to broaden its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.721" offset="714271">It resolves doubtful questions frequently in favor of its jurisdiction, and if it were a very close case, I would have thought the Court of Claims would have decided it the other way.</text>

          <turn speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="169.861" stopTime="227.069">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="169.861" offset="782817">Well, I think quite frankly the Court of Claims did not consider in this case the location of and the language of this particular subsection as compared with those that were near it, nor indeed did it consider the legislative history of Section 2680(c), which we've set out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.792" offset="858572">I think the Court of Claims was quick, maybe, to seize on the language of 2680(c) and to view it as applying to these kinds of situations because it viewed that subsection as granting broad protections to the Customs Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.888" offset="918967">We think that is not what the legislative history shows about Subsection (c) and we think that's not what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.426" offset="945089">It did not intend to say Customs Service is immune from suits against it as for example the Tennessee Valley Authority is under the provision of 2680, the last subsection, or other agencies of government, the military service or others.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.738" offset="1034324">You think it changed its character at a point?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="235.045" stopTime="377.967">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="235.045" offset="1043519">Well, of course, this case was decided on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.353" offset="1056789">All the facts were not presented, in terms of the history of how this property came into the possession of the United States and what steps led up to the notice of seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.122" offset="1091897">An interesting fact which appears just from the record, and of course that would have to be amplified, if there ultimately had to be a trial on this question, is that there were 11 weeks between the time that these goods came into the United States and until a notice of seizure was sent out.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.458" offset="1145187">Now, the notice of seizure, of course, is not a forfeiture, contrary I think to implications that might emerge from the brief filed by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.988" offset="1179355">A notice of seizure in the Customs procedure, ordinarily, just initiates the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.547" offset="1209553">It says to the importer, "Now, look.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.970" offset="1219271">We expect you now to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.717" offset="1226271">If you want to claim that there should not be a forfeiture, if you want to claim that there are circumstances which relieve us of the right to forfeit these goods, file a petition," which is exactly what was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.237" offset="1276322">But in this case, the notice of seizure didn't immediately even follow upon the arrival of the goods to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.522" offset="1301504">The goods arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.596" offset="1305788">Let me just go through those facts very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.464" offset="1313207">The goods arrived in March and April from Hamburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.859" offset="1326791">There was apparently a discrepancy between what appeared on the bills of lading, with regard to these goods, which described them all as razor blades, although in a corner it described film, and the invoices, which were equally available to Customs and were just open and notorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.558" offset="1389589">The invoices specified there were camera supplies and film and things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.322" offset="1408711">The importer, upon being notified that the goods had arrived, has the alternative under the Customs procedure, by statute and indeed, I am advised, this is routine with Customs, they encourage it, that you ask for immediate delivery rather than going through all the paper work, you can go to a Customs House broker, you can fill out a few papers and say, "Under the provision of the statute, we want immediate delivery," and then the rest of the paper work is done later.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.261" offset="1500453">That was done through a Customs House broker who took the description of the goods from the bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.300" offset="1528560">From all that appears, it was a totally innocent mistake that the Customs House broker made.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.308" offset="1564609">It was submitted to Customs and they said, "Look, there's a discrepancy between what appears on your application for immediate delivery and what appears on these invoices.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.897" offset="1598986">Consequently, we're not releasing the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.841" offset="1610689">"This led to various --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="377.967" offset="1615287">By paying $60,000, though, to dispose of this matter, there is some intimation, at least, that it wasn't totally inadvertent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="388.065" stopTime="570.699">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="388.065" offset="1655620">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me point this out What happened, those goods contained, and the first letters that went to the Customs Service contains strong protest about the fact that these goods were dated film, most of them were dated film which would expire a year and a half later.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.996" offset="1711313">By the time the Customs Service sent a notice of seizure, which was in May, by the time the protest -- protests were filed a week after the notice of seizure; within a week the requests for remission were filed -- Customs waited four months, until October of 1970 before saying, "Now, you have to submit $40,000 to get these goods out."</text>
            <text syncTime="422.478" offset="1793233">At that point the importer felt that he had written to Customs, these were dated films, the summer season had passed for which the films really were originally hoped to be out on the market, and he paid the $40,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.436" offset="1849135">I can represent to the Court again, it's not in the record, there was a petition submitted afterwards to seek to return that $40,000 to Customs because it was felt that it was inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.284" offset="1884557">But the importer is in a position in those circumstances where he can't really argue with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.802" offset="1902529">They've got his dated film, which is perishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.275" offset="1912456">They have stainless steel razor blades, which were in there, too, and the record reflects that the attorney then representing the importer wrote to Customs and said, "Look, chromium-plated blades are coming out on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.846" offset="1958745">There's a very limited period of time in which we can still sell stainless steel razor blades.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.198" offset="1976195">So we really have to get those off the dock and out into the market as quickly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.032" offset="1995525">"Under those circumstances, the importer had no choice other than to pay the money to get what was really close to $600,000 worth of goods, and hope that a subsequent petition might result in some remission of that $40,000 demand by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.248" offset="2056338">Of course, when the goods came back, 165,000 was missing, and that's what gives rise to the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.547" offset="2085595">And the question in this case is, whether if the United States finally, having taken these goods -- certainly the importer was not voluntarily surrendering them to the United States, but the United States having taken the goods -- having taken them under a statute and under a procedure whereby it was really inviting the importer to submit applications following the time that these goods were being detained -- now, the statute provides that if there's any case of forfeiture, it can't be done unless there's a libel, a proceeding filed, judicial determination with regard to forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.603" offset="2225821">So during the entire period of time that Customs had these goods, it was subject specifically to the statute, and this is not disputed, to 19 USC 1605, which says, "Pending such disposition, the property shall be stored in such place as in the collector's opinion is most convenient and appropriate with due regard to the expense involved, whether or not the place of storage is within the judicial district," and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.358" offset="2336789">The statute says it shall be placed and remain in the custody of the collector for the district in which the seizure was made to await disposition according to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.329" offset="2372733">It's in his custody to await disposition according to law.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.699" offset="2386213">Mr. Lewin, out of that language, I take it you infer a commitment to return the goods on the part of Customs?</text>

            <text syncTime="585.088" offset="2443682">I suppose so, although I think the government's brief in this Court, at least, asserts mainly that there is no bailment in this case, not because the statute does not provide for it but because in some way the custody of the United States is inconsistent with title remaining in the importer.</text>

            <text syncTime="608.332" offset="2536678">They say it's a bailment imposed by law, rather than a bailment in fact, so it isn't the kind of a bailment contract that's subject to suit in a Court of Claims?</text>

            <text syncTime="618.561" offset="2577638">Our position on that is that whether something is a bailment implied in fact depends of course, when you're dealing with the government, on what the government knows about its obligations under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.583" offset="2617657">Of course, the law says to the Collector of Customs, you're the custodian of these goods until such time as the court acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.525" offset="2649422">That means that when the Collector of Customs takes them, he knows, not by operation of law in the sense that it's contrary to his --</text>

            <text syncTime="1088.830" offset="4458663">If one looks at the language -- we've reprinted at pages 1A and 2A of our principal brief -- the language of the Tort Claims Act, the series of exceptions as originally enacted in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.820" offset="4510699">Now, when Congress wanted specifically to say that a government agency should not be liable from any damage caused by loss, it knew very well how to say so, and it did in Subsection (b). It said, "Any claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter."</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.010" offset="4587395">It would have been the simplest thing, had Congress really intended to do what the Court of Claims says, to say is to see any claim arising out of the loss of any goods or merchandise seized or taken by any officer of Customs or Excise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.907" offset="4642983">They didn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.051" offset="4647581">They said any claim arising in respect of the detention of any goods or merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.266" offset="4668479">And that has, we submit, a very narrow and specific meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.504" offset="4681435">It means exactly, if one takes the film in this case, that if the ordinary government processes resulted in all the goods being given back to the petitioner, he got every last piece of film back, and the film was dated and therefore it was of no value because of the delay caused by detention alone, he'd have no tort claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.007" offset="4759385">Detention is what causes the harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.509" offset="4769416">But when the film is missing, when it's lost or when it's damaged, that's not what Congress intended to protect against or intended to provide an exemption for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.947" offset="4803166">Congress didn't say loss or damage to the goods; it said merely detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.892" offset="4818944">Nor, for that matter, did Congress have the intention that the Court of Claims said it had to give this broad power to Customs officers to conduct their duties unfettered or unrestrained by any possibility of civil suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.980" offset="4867323">Because when Congress wanted to have that intention specifically provided for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.825" offset="4886653">Subsection (e), for example, says that there's no claim allowed for any act or omission in administering the provisions of the Trading With The Enemy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.391" offset="4932942">Now, had Congress wanted to say in administering the provisions of that, the Customs law, of the Tariff Act of 1930, or anything like that, it would have said it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.862" offset="4962826">Or, for example, Subsection (1) says any claim arising from the activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.326" offset="4984665">They didn't say any activities of the United States Customs Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.724" offset="5002219">That's what Congress would have said had it really had the intention of immunizing the United States Customs Service, the way the Court of Claims thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.469" offset="5033253">And that's why it appears to me, in answer to your question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the Court of Claims didn't look at the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.505" offset="5057390">They didn't compare it with these other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.169" offset="5064077">They immediately read this section and they said, "Well, now, look.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.363" offset="5076825">Here it says detention of goods and merchandise by any officer of Customs or Excise, and therefore that must have meant that the Customs Bureau is intended to be exempt in all its broad enforcement authority".</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.287" offset="5120502">But that's just wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.075" offset="5123636">If one looks at the language, or if one looks at the legislative history, because we have set it out in our brief, and I certainly don't have the time to go into it in detail, but Judge Holtzoff, later Judge Holtzoff who was then a special the principal proponent of this legislation on behalf of the Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.167" offset="5196048">He testified before the Congress that this provision, Subsection (c), was not like other provisions which were intended, like the Postal Service Provision, which were intended to immunize government agencies which were carrying out important functions and could not therefore be bothered or should not be restrained in some way by the possibility of civil suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.077" offset="5271698">He said certain provisions, including Subsection (c), were designed to simply preserve existing remedies for these kinds of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.434" offset="5313076">Well, the existing remedies with regard to any improper collection of Customs or duty were certain statutory provisions which, again we specified in our brief, which had nothing to do with whether you can bring a lawsuit if goods are harmed or lost or damaged in the course of custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.316" offset="5464586">But certainly so far as the rationale of the Court of Claims is concerned -- let me point out, the Court of Claims said, and the Court of Claims has been very careful in many cases and the has cited them -- the Court of Claims has been very careful in many cases to say, to keep this distinction between bailments implied in fact and bailments implied in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.209" offset="5536162">And yet the Court of Claims said as to this particular bailment that on both, as a result of the statute and as a result of the fact that the notice of seizure, which was served on the petitioner in October of 1970, said, "Look, you give us $40,000, we'll give you your goods back," on that basis the Court of Claims said this is a strong case for a bailment in fact."</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.497" offset="5657370">The statute cited by the plaintiff, along with the action of the United States Customs Service in agreeing to return the seized goods upon payment of a $40,000 fine by Hatzlachh could make a strong case for the existence of an implied in fact contract, properly to preserve and redeliver all the goods to Hatzlachh.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.061" offset="5719646">All other things being equal, such a factual and legal combination might enable plaintiff to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.178" offset="5744097">Now, this is from a court which in a whole line of cases has said, "We don't have jurisdiction over implied in law contracts," and they've drawn that distinction very clearly, and yet as to these facts, they recognize that both the statute and the fact that the notices of seizure anticipate this kind of a thing, makes a case under which they thought if not for 2680 (c) the plaintiff would prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.421" offset="6041057">It's illegal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2833.123" offset="11435865">Both sides have agreed that Congress adopted the Tort Claims Act exception for customs detentions in section 2680(c) in recognition of the fact that there were adequate preexisting remedies for persons who were seized -- whose goods are seized by the customs officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.078" offset="11511724">There is an argument about whether the language of 2680(c) requires that construction, permits it or doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.412" offset="11540982">I think that the answer is that it certainly permits the construction, and what we have to decide is whether the legislative history of the act indicates Congress' intent to cover the situation where there is a private remedy under 28 U.S.C. 2006.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.579" offset="11613706">And petitioner concedes that the traditional preexisting remedy is the remedy under 28 U.S.C. 2006 for negligent loss of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.822" offset="11654666">Section 2006 provides only a limited remedy against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.264" offset="11676400">The United States pays the judgment in the private action for negligent loss of goods only if the seizure is made with probable cause, and petitioner argues that the remedy is no limited that it is inadequate and thus Congress didn't mean to preserve it as the sole remedy for the loss of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.577" offset="11745677">Well, the remedy in section 2006 is obviously adequate in all cases where the goods were seized for probable cause, for the reason I just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.704" offset="11778173">The judgment in those cases is not paid by the customs officer, it is paid by the United States Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.588" offset="11805759">In the relatively few cases where a seizure is made without probable cause, the United States will not pay the judgment but the customs officer then remains personally liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.265" offset="11848391">Indeed, the officer is liable on a theory of conversion for consequential damages as well as the value of the goods themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.467" offset="11881200">Well, that retained personal liability obviously serves the government's interests in preventing misconduct by its officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.500" offset="11913383">The limitation in section 2006 seems designed to advance the government's interest in prohibiting unlawful seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.414" offset="11941073">It doesn't make the entire remedial scheme inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.038" offset="11955493">The relevance of the Tort Claims Act exception and the history of the act to this case to us seems to be simply that it evidences Congress' intent not to disturb the limited preexisting remedy under section 2006 by assuming a general tort responsibility for customs seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.838" offset="12034696">As the Court of Claims reasoned in this case, the government cannot, as petitioner claims, impliedly assent in fact to a contract liability for acts that it has refused by law to be responsible for in tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.258" offset="12092374">Or stated another way, the specific remedial provision in 28 U.S.C. 2006 should control over the more general provisions of either the Federal Tort Claims Act or the Tucker Act, and I think that was essentially the reasoning that this Court decided the Stanzilero case on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.291" offset="12164577">For these reasons, we think that judgment of the Court of Claims should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.632" offset="12197909">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.166" offset="12199999">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.939" offset="12207104">Mr. Jones has been speaking throughout his argument about the traditional remedy under 2006 and saying that we have conceded that that is a remedy that has traditionally been applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.414" offset="12245034">By no means, 2006 is not a statute which grants any remedy whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.117" offset="12267813">Although a hundred years ago and more, there were suits against individual collectors of customs, there are not suits today against individual collectors of customs which -- I think he said during the course of colloquy -- Treasury has always paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.319" offset="12328626">These suits simply don't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.743" offset="12338343">Since the Tort Claims Act has been enacted, since the United States has agreed to be sued directly, the only suits that I have found reference to in this regard have been, for example, the Alliance Insurance Company case, which was a suit that was brought --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3073.860" offset="12398843">That is because of the plaintiff's choice to sue the United States rather than the collector personally.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="3079.048" offset="12419532">But given that the United States has now decided that individual employees are no longer to be sued, they passed the Federal Tort Claims Act so you don't have to go running after the individual employee, it is just totally inconsistent with the current thrust of federal statute and remedies against the federal government to say you have to sue under the cause of action that you had 150 years ago against a collector of customs and under a Civil War statute, 2006, which appears in the footnote on page 27 of the government's brief, is a statute passed in 1863 to keep levies from being made against the property of collectors of customs -- executions shall not issue against a collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.687" offset="12582118">It doesn't say you may bring a suit against the collector or you may bring a suit against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.270" offset="12600404">It says don't execute -- when you bring one of these suits, which people have brought against individual collectors, you can't execute against his property because the United States will pay if he has been acting with probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.818" offset="12650663">That is not a traditional remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.116" offset="12655888">It is just not framed in those terms, it never has been a traditional remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.952" offset="12679189">In terms of this actually being an implied contract in fact, the fact that there isn't that much of a consensual arrangement still doesn't make it different from cases in which the United States, for example, in a taking, for example, has flooded somebody's property -- this Court has had cases such as the Dickenson and Lynah case, we quoted from the Lynah case --</text>

            <text syncTime="3163.871" offset="12758810">That is partly involved in the Fifth Amendment, but this Court has very clearly said, language by Justice Frankfurter, I think, in the Dickenson case, that in no circumstances does either a taking or there was an implied promise by the government to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.020" offset="12807502">We cited in our petition for certiorari the language of Judge Learned Hand in the C. F. Harms case, where a barge was taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="3201.813" offset="12910634">The United States ought to pay if it is lost while it is in the United States possession during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.365" offset="12936861">It is certainly not fair to impose that obligation for that loss on an individual importer who is totally blameless.</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.405" offset="12992972">That is why there is no claim that this is a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.705" offset="13002167">What we are saying is that it is an implied bailment in an implied contract in which the United States, if it has it for government purposes in its possession for temporary detention, if it gives it back that is fine, there is no suit for the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.774" offset="13062457">But certainly if the United States for one reason or another doesn't give all the property back, then it is the one who should be held liable for policy reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="3248.320" offset="13096626">Dickenson and Lynah in part depend on the fact that where the government takes and doesn't bring an action, the person who is the victim of the taking has to bring an action for inverse taking and has to show an authority on the part of the government to take and the taking isn't enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.677" offset="13186069">Isn't that what Frankfurter's language in Dickenson refers to?</text>

            <text syncTime="3283.231" offset="13236328">And Judge Hand spoke about the bailment, an implied contract where you take a barge in emergency circumstances, the Army had neither asked no leave of the railroad for anything it might do, it could move it when it close. Everybody understood that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.875" offset="13298918">The railroad understood that and therefore there was nothing lacking that was essential to a bailment.</text>
