            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">In No. 78-990, United States versus Bailey and the companion case of United States against Cogdell involves the construction of a prison escape statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.950" offset="67709">In 19776, Clifford Bailey, James Cogdell, Ronald Cooley, and Ralph Walker escaped from the District of Columbia Jail where they were being held in federal custody as a result of being either convicted of or arrested for various felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.189" offset="136673">The FBI recaptured these four men separately after they had remained at large anywhere from one to three and one half months and charged them with violating 18 U.S.C. Section 751 (a) which makes escape from federal custody a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.098" offset="220369">At their trial, each of the defendants attempted to prove that he was forced to escape by the conditions that escape of the D.C. jail during the summer of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.721" offset="266867">These alleged conditions included trash fires, objects thrown from the cells, attempted beatings of prisoners by guards and failure to provide adequate medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.450" offset="317753">At each of the trials, the District Judge inquired into the defendant's conduct after they freed themselves from the allegedly oppressive conditions of the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.539" offset="358087">Cogdell and Cooley, each of whom had remained at large for one month offered no evidence of any attempt to surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.627" offset="394449">Bailey who had eluded the FBI for almost three months testified that he had someone contact the jail officials but that he did not turn himself in because he did not want to go back to the D.C. jail and because someone had told him that the FBI would kill him if they caught him.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.799" offset="471144">Walker testified that he spoke on the telephone with an FBI agent three times in an attempt to negotiate a surrender but that he broke off communications when the agent could not promise him that they would not be sent back to the D.C. jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.735" offset="530913">He remained at large another two months before the FBI recaptured him.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.470" offset="553796">At the trial for prison escape, the District Judge ruled that because the defendants had remained at large long after freeing themselves from the allegedly oppressive conditions of the jail, evidence of those conditions was irrelevant to the question whether they had violated Section 751 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="158.577" offset="634253">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed holding that the evidence of the conditions that they jail was relevant in determining whether the defendants had the necessary intent to commit the crime of escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.968" offset="687856">According to the Court of Appeals an escapee was not guilty of violating Section 751 (a) unless he left custody in order to avoid the normal conditions of confinement as opposed to conditions which included trash fires and beatings.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.828" offset="759223">Today we hold in turning the file with the clerk that the Court of Appeals erred in requiring proof of such an intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.905" offset="787540">Section 751 (a) prohibits knowingly escaping from physical custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.989" offset="811886">That section includes within its literal terms prisoners who escape from custody to avoid any aspect of their confinement normal or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.317" offset="853264">It may be that a prisoner who is threatened with death or serious bodily injury might be able to defend an escape charge on the grounds of duress or necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.574" offset="894224">Such defenses however are available only if the defendant had no reasonable alternative to violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.087" offset="932258">Here, Bailey, Cooley, Cogdell, and Walker violated Section 751 (a) not only by their initial escape but also by their continued absence from federal custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.962" offset="979801">Whatever justification they had for escaping from jail on the first place, they offered no legally sufficient reason for remaining at large up to three and a half months.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.113" offset="1024418">We therefore conclude that the District Court did not err in removing the evidence of conditions of the jail from consideration by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.247" offset="1064960">The judgment of Court of -- the judgments of the Court of Appeals are reversed and the cases are remanded for reinstatement of the judgments of the District Court.</text>
