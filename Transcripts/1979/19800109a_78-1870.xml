            <text syncTime="63.627" offset="357857">My name is Robert Mann.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.280" offset="364544">I represent the petitioner, Whirlpool Corporation, in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.543" offset="385546">This case raises a question of statutory interpretation, and specifically, whether under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, Congress intended to confer certain job security rights upon employees who might refuse to work because of perceived safety hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.726" offset="474258">The Secretary of Labor, in 1973, published a regulation purporting to interpret the act, and stating in the regulation that, as a general rule, the legislative history and the act itself indicated that Congress did not intend to create job security rights within the context of OSHA for employees who might refuse to work because of perceived safety hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.944" offset="591182">Within the interpretative regulation, however, but without citing any legislative history or other source, the Secretary of Labor hypothesized situations which might give rise to such job security provisions if an employee refused work in imminent danger conditions, when resort to the normal enforcement procedures were not available.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.709" offset="830255">Whirlpool Corporation agrees with the Secretary that the legislative history of the act, and the act itself, clearly demonstrate that it was not Congress' intent to legislate job security provisions within the scope of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, except perhaps in connection with the protection of employees to invoke the procedures of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.219" offset="924296">However, it is our position, and we believe the facts of this case demonstrate, that that type of exception would not exist in this case, since the work refusal occurred outside the scope or context of any attempt to invoke the statutory procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.178" offset="996080">The case arose in June and July of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.809" offset="1018650">It arose at Whirlpool's Marion, Ohio, plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.934" offset="1039130">And on the night -- on the day shift of June 28th, 1974, an employee who was working at that plant, on a normal maintenance assignment on the overhead guard screen in the plant, fell between two panels of the screen and sustained fatal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.145" offset="1115930">Following that accident, Whirlpool notified OSHA of the fatality.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.527" offset="1133484">And on July 1st, 1974, an OSHA inspector conducted an inspection in relation to the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.217" offset="1164204">He informed management at the conclusion of his inspection that he felt the accident was a result of a mechanical failure, an unforeseeable accident.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.492" offset="1681324">Well, the Secretary's authorization to promulgate regulations under the statute exists with respect to the promulgation of standards, uniform standards, of course; and also, under Section 8(g), publication of regulations governing his own responsibilities under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.394" offset="1752900">We do not read the act to provide him plenary regulatory authority to, in effect, issue legislative-type regulations under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.181" offset="1792084">And I don't believe the Secretary has contended that this particular regulation is a legislative-type regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.216" offset="1816221">He is attempting to interpret Section 11(c) of the act to find that under certain circumstances an employee would have a right to refuse a work assignment without regard to the employment consequences of that refusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.386" offset="1884871">On July 7th, two employees approached their supervision and asked to be relieved of guard screen duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.957" offset="1915173">They were denied in their request, and on July 9th, one of the two employees contacted the OSHA area director for the region and spoke with him about the guard screen.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.985" offset="1963342">Prior to that contact, of course, the OSHA People had conducted their inspection, and as it turned out later, had already decided to issue a citation with respect to the guard screen system.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.032" offset="2007542">The citation was not, of course, however, received by Whirlpool until the 12th or 13th of July.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.719" offset="2038262">On the evening shift of July 10th, a supervisor accompanied the two complaining employees to a section of overhead guard screen; climbed up to the guard screen, the supervisor did, and physically walked across the guard screen for from 10 to 15 minutes, approximately 800 feet in length, to physically demonstrate to these two employees that the screen they were to work on that evening was safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.607" offset="2157798">Following that physical demonstration, he asked the two employees to clean some materials which had fallen on the guard screen, from the guard screen; and they refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.390" offset="2196982">They were subsequently issued a disciplinary warning, lost four hours pay by being suspended, and thus generated this particular litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.652" offset="2237942">Both employees returned to work the following day, and have continued to work on the--one of them has continued to work on the guard screen to date; the other apparently is in another position.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.981" offset="2279320">At no time throughout this proceeding has the Secretary of Labor or his delegate attempted in any way to initiate any type of imminent danger proceeding, as is contemplated under Section 13 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.754" offset="2342431">Nor, so far as we know, have the complaining employees attempted to initiate such a proceeding on their own, as is their right under Section 13 of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.820" offset="2378689">The Secretary of Labor's position under this particular set of facts is to have processed this case through the normal enforcement channels of citation, hearing, and ultimate decision by the Occupation Safety and Health Review Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.369" offset="2448802">The complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.301" offset="2452564">The Federal District Court for the Northern District of Ohio ruled in the case that the Secretary's interpretation of the regulation -- of the act--was so inconsistent, so clearly inconsistent with the legislative history and the act itself that he felt he had no choice but to reject the Secretary's interpretation and dismiss the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.143" offset="13503927">The two bits of legislative history to which he makes reference are, the one pertaining to strike-with-pay, and the other pertaining to shutting down a plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.577" offset="13553664">And in our brief we distinguish them, I believe successfully, by pointing out that the strike with pay provision applied not to imminent danger, but applied to a section of the statute which required the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to develop a schedule of toxic substances, exposure to which created an impermissible hazard; and that after the Secretary promulgated this list -- in fact, six months after that -- an employee could then leave his workplace, and not return until certain protective measures were adopted, including protective clothing and certain kinds of notices and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.627" offset="13761912">This is the provision that was in the Daniels bill that was rejected utterly by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.831" offset="13790647">But we submit that this was not at all related to the question of immediate, imminent danger to life and limb; and therefore, the fact that that was rejected doesn't mean that the Congress meant to reject the ultra-hazardous situation that happened under these narrow circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.063" offset="13879672">The other legislative history related to the right that would be given an inspector for a short period of time to shut down a plant or an operation, and this was similarly rejected when it appeared in the Senate bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.513" offset="13933380">And we suggest the right that we believe the statute implies, as described in the regulations, doesn't shut down a plant or an operation, unless it's just a one-person plant; it just means that the employee who is confronted with imminent danger to life or limb may, to save his own life, or to spare him the cruel dilemma of choosing between his job and his health, might discontinue, and be free from discrimination.</text>
