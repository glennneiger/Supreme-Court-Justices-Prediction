            <text syncTime="83.783" offset="438523">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.901" offset="450957">This case involves an appeal from a final judgment of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania which affirmed awards to claimant appellees for facial disfigurement under the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.111" offset="503829">The question presented to this Court today is whether Pennsylvania may constitutionally award benefits under its state workmen's compensation law for injuries to maritime workers covered by the Longshoremen's Act as amended in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.147" offset="583973">The central facts necessary to the resolution of the question are not in dispute in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.954" offset="611140">Sun Ship is an employer within the meaning of the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.865" offset="630784">It is engaged in shipbuilding and ship repair activities at its facilities adjoining the Delaware River, a navigable water of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.378" offset="668923">Each of the claimants, at the time of his injury, was employed by Sun Ship, and was engaged in maritime employment, either shipbuilding or ship repair, and as an employee within the meaning of the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.836" offset="730676">In addition, each of the appellees were injured upon the navigable waters of the United States as that term has been defined in both Sections 3 (a) of the amended Longshoremen's Act, its covering provisions, and in Section 24 which defines employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.701" offset="810193">It is further undisputed that the injuries involved here fall within the coverage of the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.148" offset="839973">Every administrative tribunal below and the court below so found and it has never been in question here and indeed it's conceded by appellees in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.029" offset="883440">We submit that the judgment of the court below must be reversed because upon analysis of the amended Longshoremen's Act, the legislative history to the 1972 amendments and consideration of the State's purposes and objectives, it is evident that the Congress intended to preempt the application of state workmen's compensation laws when enacted the 1972 amendments to the Longshoremen's Act as those laws might apply to maritime workers injured upon the navigable waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.968" offset="1019277">In addition to the extent that a review of the Longshoremen's Act and the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act reveals both a general and in the very instance of this case, specific conflicts with the regulatory scheme determined to apply by Congress, the Pennsylvania Act must yield.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.238" offset="1340374">But of course, in the course of amending the Longshoremen's Act, Congress substantially removed those problems at least in the context of shipbuilding and ship repair operations because it moved the line away from the water's edge which had been the most troublesome line of all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.014" offset="4615398">You find that evidence because What Congress has done is it has not limited the remedy as it have been limited prior to 1972 to injures -- injuries occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.480" offset="4661269">That is a situs-oriented task.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.577" offset="4669628">In addition, Congress in Section 5 said both before and after 1972 that the remedy is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.196" offset="4700139">And significantly, in 1972, Congress eliminated the only language that had ever existed in the Longshoremen's Act that seem to permit the States to operate by ruling the --</text>

            <text syncTime="1221.728" offset="4990307">And if it leaves the proviso only in place, it is coming on land with the remedy where the States, under this Court's decision in Nacirema and -- and many decisions before had been viewed as competent to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.083" offset="5039731">So if it comes on land with the proviso, I think it's plainly creating a concurrent remedy, but it doesn't come on land with the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.547" offset="5069511">It eliminates the proviso and at the same time, it expands the coverage of the Act in such a way to indicate that it is exercising both its admiralty power and tort and in contract, and it's doing it in an area where uniformity is the law and I think that the congressional intent to preempt the field is demonstrated by the statutory language alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.243" offset="5204302">Well, Your Honor, I think that they were probably relying upon the decisions of this Court which had previously held Section 5 to be exclusive in a situation where the remedy applies and it acts against that background just as the Court found in Parker, that Congress in enacting the statute of 1927, was acting against the background of the Jensen line without examining the validity of the Jensen line as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.952" offset="5295208">Similarly here, even in Davis, which is the very case upon which appellees rely to create the doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction, you have this Court saying that of course if federal coverage were clear, the federal remedy would be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.469" offset="5373262">And I think that in -- in that context, Section 5 and the elimination of the State law proviso along with the affirmative expansion of jurisdiction which this Court has already recognized in both Northeast Terminals and in Pfeiffer manifest the congressional intent to occupy the field.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.200" offset="5552149">Well that this is going to be idea of it that after the Calbeck decision, you certainly have Section 5 still reading or then reading as it still reads and it was then assumed, there was an area of overlap.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.204" offset="5604185">Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't think -- I -- I agree that it was assumed that there was but I don't think either Calbeck or Davis compelled that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.385" offset="5632920">First of all, Calbeck's -- by its own terms says it wasn't addressing the question of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.628" offset="5657893">It had no need to because you're having a claiming of the federal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.036" offset="5675551">Secondly, Calbeck, to the extent that it is read as creating concurrent jurisdiction depends upon the proviso and the continued viability of the maritime -- the local exception which prior to Calbeck had been -- had been read as being embodied within the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.722" offset="5738245">In 1972, the proviso goes and I submit with it any notion that Calbeck supports concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.948" offset="5767189">In addition, Calbeck was modified in another way in 1972 because the holding in Calbeck was that if you're injured upon the navigable waters of the United States that you have a federal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.951" offset="5811179">In 1972, Congress I think has made it plain that that even is not necessarily true because you have to also be engaged in maritime activity or meet the status test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.855" offset="5850781">Now, I appreciate that at some point, you may run into the kind of situation where the States aroused it and if it's not maritime act -- it -- it's not maritime activity that this Court may have to resolve that question, but it is surely not presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.257" offset="5908355">So Calbeck itself was substantially modified in 1972 both as to its affirmative ground and as to the questions that it left answered.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffery C. Hayes</label>
            <text syncTime="1462.554" offset="5953599">We think that the totality of the circumstances evidenced in the language of the statute in addition to the legislative history, manifest congressional intent to adopt a uniform system which a system of concurrent jurisdiction simply is not and cannot be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.451" offset="6017128">Indeed, a system of concurrent jurisdiction would create the very kind of problem that Congress addressed here because as we've already noted, there is some limit to the ability of the States to provide the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.024" offset="6063417">Thus, if we take a law -- a shipbuilder who spends part of his time in the shops upon the ways, upon the land, if you will, at Sun Ship, and part of his day working in a dry dock or in a vessel floating in the navigable waters of the United States, if he is injured, seaward of the Jensen line, concurrent jurisdiction is plainly not available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.860" offset="6154846">Only the employee injured on land has two remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.280" offset="6172505">We submit that there was no concurrent jurisdiction really before 1972 and thus, in order to say that the -- that the shipbuilder or the ship repairman who moves both on to and off of the navigable waters, if by force -- fortuitous circumstances he's injured on land, now has two remedies, that that also runs counter to the congressional intent to provide a uniform remedy because he provides a disparate remedy and there is absolutely no indication in the legislative history or the statute that Congress intended to leave the employee injured upon land in a better situation than the maritime worker injured upon the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.426" offset="6349093">In addition, the other anomaly that might result if we were to find -- if this Court were to hold that a system of concurrent jurisdiction exists is that a worker who received an award under a state statute which makes a state remedy exclusive of every other remedy, for example, taxes which is the statute that this Court dealt with in Magnolia Power, maybe barred by operation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of 28 U.S.C. 1738 from recovering his longshoremen's remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.945" offset="6491199">And if the taxes remedy as Justice Keith so plainly pointed out in his dissent in the Johnson case is a remedy that is a lesser remedy, it does not provide the claimant with the kind of recovery that -- that Congress provided under the Longshoremen's Act, that was all, thus plainly anomalous, and contrary the congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.592" offset="6577716">There can be no doubt that the congressional remedy is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.818" offset="6590673">It covers every aspect of the relationship between the employer and the employee once an injury triggers its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.995" offset="6631320">The terms and body of legislative judgment concerning the rights and liabilities of employers and it was -- that judgment which Congress has made and the States under the circumstances are not free to modify, interfere with, even compliment or adjust the congressional judgment as to those rights and liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.710" offset="6710209">This actually makes a great deal of sense when you think about the problems that the two legislatures, the Pennsylvania legislature and the Congress are facing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.332" offset="6744691">Pennsylvania's Act is a statute of general application and applies to all employment situations in the commonwealth while the Longshoremen's Act as a special statute dealing with special occupations and embodying Congress's judgment about how such injury should be compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.558" offset="6809579">And this is an area in which Congress has been found particularly competent to operate and where it does affirmatively operate, uniform effect is given to its statutory enactments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.076" offset="6859630">Pennsylvania on the other hand, it's interest here in compensating maritime workers is no different than its interest in compensating employees generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.792" offset="6902575">It has no special interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.074" offset="6911666">And indeed, the Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board, advised this Court through its clerk when asked whether it wanted to submit a motion to affirm or dismiss under Rule 16 that Pennsylvania had no interest adverse to that of the appellant, no interest adverse to that of Sun Ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.723" offset="6974255">So this is not a situation where you have a state here claiming some special interest or right which again distinguishes the situation from Askew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.141" offset="7011976">Finally, the Acts when put together and as you look at them from provision to provision, there are plain conflicts because a workmen's compensation statute is and represents an entire balancing of the rights and remedies and liabilities and obligation to the parties, you cannot really effectively start to look only at a specific conflict and say, “Well, because of that specific conflict, Pennsylvania is ousted here, but the rest of its remedy is available provided there's no specific conflict.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.601" offset="7141752">There's a specific conflict right here in the disfigurements that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.004" offset="7159411">Pennsylvania applies different standards for recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.689" offset="7174144">Pennsylvania provides a remedy for disfigurement to different parts of the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.109" offset="7195773">Now, admittedly, Pennsylvania's Act might have provided a higher recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.667" offset="7218030">None of the claimants here of course received more than the remedy provided under the federal statute which has but a single standard for recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.542" offset="7261497">And moreover, the Pennsylvania awards here were reduced by counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.296" offset="7284590">That is not the way the Longshoremen's Act work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.909" offset="7295039">In contested cases, the counsel fee is an add-on, an additional payment by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.306" offset="7316564">So in summary, we have a total occupation to the field and we think an express intent that that federal remedy will operate exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.876" offset="7350836">It is a complete remedy and it actually conflicts in many respects not just in the area of disfigurement, maximum compensation, treatment of occupational disease, definition to the injury, scheduled losses, limitation periods, the notice of injury provisions, they're all different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.001" offset="7423352">And in that situation, we think that the Court should give full effect to the congressional mandate and the congressional remedy by holding that Pennsylvania may not provide a remedy to injured maritime workers whose claims fall under the Longshoremen's Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.176" offset="7520110">The Workmen's Compensation Act is not administered by any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.607" offset="7541844">It's not administered by the Federal Government, the Longshoreman Harbor Worker's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.928" offset="7563055">Ever State's Workmen's Compensation Act perhaps except Ohio which they have a state system, as well as the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act is administered by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.762" offset="7610389">The man is -- person is hurt, the employer has a duty to file notice of injury under Pennsylvania, under the federal law and starts to make payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.088" offset="7659708">It's the employer indeed at the outset -- at the outset who makes that election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.448" offset="7689174">A fraction -- I think the National Safety Council and U.S. Department of Labors -- Bureau of Labor Standards reports there are some two million timeless accident cases reported each year in the United States and a fraction of them result in contested workmen's compensation claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.289" offset="7764511">Most of the claims are paid as a matter of course because the employer recognizes if there's an injury and are paid, very few are in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.112" offset="7807770">The significance of this of course is that the injured worker makes -- makes -- unless he consults a lawyer, unless something happens to him claim, unless he doesn't get compensation, unless compensation payments stop, does not consult a lawyer and therefore he himself exercises no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.356" offset="7896795">This case is a matter of fact where Sun Ship comes in and tells what a beneficent employer they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.609" offset="7925844">When these five men were injured, Sun Ship never reported this is a -- as a work-related injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.084" offset="7951757">They say that under federal law, these men are covered, but Sun Ship never reported any of these five cases to the Deputy Commissioner's Office, so the Deputy Commissioner could advise people of their rights and start the federal law working.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.154" offset="8016018">The men in this case when consulted an attorney in our office, and we filed claims under the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.714" offset="8046216">We filed claims under the state law because (1) state law in Pennsylvania on a disfigurement case takes about 68 weeks for an adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.032" offset="8087489">State -- under federal, it's between 18 months and two years because we go through the informal proceedings before the Deputy Commissioner determines if the case is settled, and if it's not settled, it then goes to administrative law judge and we wait for a -- with a full hearing and findings of fact and conclusions of law, lots of testimony are taken and the average has been somewhere between 18 months and two years for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.841" offset="8190725">And of course, in these cases, the awards where somewhere between 500 and $1500 per man but conceptually, because Pennsylvania has a higher limit in disfigurement cases, a -- a small type of disfigurement is going to warrant more money than under federal law, we have $3,500 as a maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.647" offset="8289991">Now, it seems to me that this Court is bound by Davis, is bound by Calbeck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.351" offset="8328756">In Davis, the exact issue was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.279" offset="8344534">Davis was a person who was conceivably working on a barge in a navigable water in the State of -- of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.975" offset="8387271">He was -- as a result of industrial injury, he -- he fell into the -- the river, the navigable water and died.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.721" offset="8418304">He was paid benefits under the -- when he applied for benefits under the -- the State of Washington law, the -- the defense of the Federal Act was raised and there, the Court in Davis recognizing the strong policy arguments and the strong policy argument of course said, “No, there is concurrent and overlapping jurisdiction” and the strong policy arguments there which are the strong policy arguments in Calbeck and a strong policy arguments here as if the Act is to be construed liberally to protect injured workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.724" offset="8566262">And unless you have concurrent jurisdiction, you're going to have the injured worker being adversely affected by uncertainty as to where he should go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.120" offset="8607848">You're going to have an adversely being affected by long delay in getting his benefits and you're going to have him adversely be affected by the expense in long court proceedings to determine what law applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.414" offset="8661034">And I say this because of the fact that if we make either state law exclusive or federal law exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.320" offset="8688619">What that means is that when a case suggests exclusivity of either state law or federal law, the employer is going to raise that as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.654" offset="8737938">And this is extremely crucial especially in view of the 1972 amendments which expanded coverage of the Longshoremen Harbor Workers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.104" offset="8775764">So we're going to have tangential situations where state law -- state courts of the maritime states, and I guess Mississippi Valley States and the States which affect navigable waters are going to be decided -- be deciding federal coverage of the Longshoremen's Harbor Workers' Act because if the -- the question on the exclusive -- if this Court holds that the federal law is exclusive, then a state claim would be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.763" offset="8898435">The way it stands under concurrent jurisdiction, the States rule on their law, the federal government rules on -- on its law if a claimant decides to go both ways which is of course a remote situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.676" offset="8950053">But assuming a claimant decides, takes a federal benefit and feel it's State's benefit is more -- is better for him or vice versa, takes a state benefit and then comes in to the -- to the federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2247.363" offset="9092786">When these men were injured, Sun Ship figured that because they had a facial scar and were unaware of the law that they would never file claim and then it would fade and it would go away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.472" offset="9145240">Therefore, Sun Ship which was the administrator of the Longshoremen Harbor Workers' Act as far as the claimants are concerned, were silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.027" offset="9187453">They did not file the notice of compensation payable or -- or the notice of injury with -- with the Deputy Commissioner's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.236" offset="9220368">Now, just to backtrack a little of what happens when an employer is duty-bound under the Act to file a notice of injury with the Deputy Commissioner's Office whose charged with Congress to administer the Longshoremen Harbor Workers' Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.001" offset="9279404">When they filed that notice in the Deputy Commissioner's Office sends a letter to the injured person telling them that they have a right under the Longshoremen Harbor Workers' Act and contact us, establish a relationship with our office and we'll tell you how to get your rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.245" offset="9344397">Now, that didn't happen in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2315.260" offset="9364459">Later, when these men had these scars, they contacted our office and said, “Can I get paid for this facial disfigurement?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.224" offset="9396224">As a lawyer, I felt they could get paid under the federal Act or the state Act and since there was concurrent or overlapping jurisdiction and we proceeded under the State law because it was easier to get the benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.763" offset="11278399">Because otherwise, you're going to have the employer saying, “Well, put this guy into Pennsylvania because the State -- the -- the maximum is less than the federal.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.168" offset="11388008">I just like to address myself to -- to a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.495" offset="11437328">They argue -- Sun Ship argues change of the 197 -- by the 1972 law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.821" offset="11462614">And the only change that we could find of any significance is the deletion in -- in Section 3 (a) of -- of that provision that says, “If recovery may not validly be provided by state law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.237" offset="11520293">And the five states which have -- which have considered this issue plus the four circuit, have agreed with the interpretation that this Court in Calbeck in eliminating that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.011" offset="11583404">And by eliminating that language -- perhaps it wasn't as clear what the Court meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.723" offset="11618304">The dissenting opinion said that Calbeck eliminated this -- this problem of concurrence -- this problem to excluclusifi -- exclusiveness -- well, the exclusiveness of the law because what it did, it says, if there's an area -- there's a -- there's a solid wall here and if a state law applies, then you can't have a federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.145" offset="11703986">And what Calbeck did is -- just had the overlap concept out of Davis and said, “Well, if there is a federal law, if there is a state law, then we have concurrent jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.520" offset="11749439">Now, the Congress, it did -- did what Calbeck did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.239" offset="11776293">It eliminated this and I don't see how the -- the appellee could argue -- the appellant could argue that by eliminating this, it made jurisdiction exclusive because the only area in the law where we could or would deal with -- with this question of jurisdiction is under the situs provision of Section 3 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.800" offset="11866572">And in that, what they did was, they -- Congress agreed with Calbeck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.196" offset="11888201">Now, Mr. Hayes says well, the Court didn't say what they really said in Calbeck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.446" offset="11909204">Well, sometimes it's hard to -- to read opinions of -- of the Supreme Court but most certainly the dissent said that it -- that it did it, it took it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.904" offset="11947029">Larson said it took out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.531" offset="11957478">Gilmore and Black said it took it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.724" offset="11966255">So, to the extent that -- that the Congressmen may not have read the actual decision, they've read what others said about it and what others said about it was that we have full concurrent jurisdiction because we've eliminated the state -- the state and federal barriers and that's what I think had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.635" offset="12053922">The -- they argue that Section 5 pre -- is exclusive and therefore, precludes a workman's compensation remedy other than the federal remedy, or all States have this Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.003" offset="12123408">And Section 5 was the price that the injured worker paid for workmen's compensation, thus, he gave up his common law action against his employer to receive benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.928" offset="12171055">As a matter of fact, these five men could have brought common law actions against Sun Ship if they wanted to because if we read the exclusivity part of -- of Section 5 (a), it says -- it's exclusive, they tell us but they say except if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this chapter, which Sun Ship did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.628" offset="12265932">An injured employee or his legal representative in case the -- death results from the injury may elect a claim compensation under this chapter or what are we -- what are they giving us, what are they giving the injured worker, they took away or to maintain an action at law or an admiralty for damages on account of such injury or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.279" offset="12364466">So that's what they -- they -- Congress has taken away by the exclusivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.620" offset="12381811">That is that right to maintain that action in law or the action on admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.402" offset="12405008">They made no -- they made no thought or mention of -- of state workmen's compensation law, and that's why in Davis, the Court said, “It doesn't apply, 5 (a) doesn't apply.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.281" offset="12460492">And indeed, it does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.392" offset="12492988">The issue is framed by the appellant in its brief as it appears on page 6, is a very simple issue which this Court amply answered in the Askew case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.862" offset="12562787">Askew was a unanimous opinion by the Court and starting on page 37 and continuing, is that extremely eloquent and intelligent discussion deciding the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.827" offset="12634676">And the defendant -- the Sun Ship says, “The issue is whether the plain -- the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act is repugnant to the Supremacy Clause of the Admiralty Clause in is it -- when it's applied to permit the exercise of jurisdiction by Pennsylvania over an area within coverage of the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act” and this was the exact issue in Askew.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.427" offset="12769050">In Askew, the issue was whether a state constitutionally may exercise its -- and I'm reading from page 337 -- may exercise its police power respecting maritime activities concurrently with the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.183" offset="12828087">And -- and here's a resounding answer, yes it may and -- and I -- I pray that -- that you will answer the question in the same way.</text>
