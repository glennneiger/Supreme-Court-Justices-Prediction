            <text syncTime="55.399" offset="324942">I would like to take some time, with the Court's indulgence, to explain some of the facts that brought the case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.703" offset="358170">In January of 1975, one Herschel Roberts was arrested on the charge of forging a check.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.362" offset="392861">At that time he was afforded a preliminary hearing in the Mentor Municipal Court, at which hearing he was present it was a hearing before a judicial tribunal, a judge the hearing was recorded witnesses were called and sworn the defendant had the opportunity and the use of counsel, counsel was present and other indicia of reliability were present at this time in that defendant had the opportunity to use the compulsory process of the state to force the attendance of witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.288" offset="536534">At the preliminary hearing the witness was called by the defense counsel, and it was expected then that this witness would corroborate something in light of the defendant's testimony, or anticipated defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.022" offset="607483">The case -- the preliminary hearing proceeded, and after the calling of this witness and the discovery, then, by the defense counsel, that this witness was testifying adversely to his defendant, the defense counsel, without objection from the state, without objection from the court, began to ask leading and argumentative questions --</text>

            <text syncTime="157.826" offset="734647">But we do have a provision that provides that in this type of situation, the counsel can ask the court to declare the witness hostile to allow him to cross-examine the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.526" offset="785429">Now, of course, with no objection --</text>

            <text syncTime="227.961" offset="1015202">The hearing continued, and of course, the defendant -- the probable cause was found, and the defendant was bound over to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.235" offset="1044355">He was subsequently indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.125" offset="1051878">Fourteen months later was the trial on the action.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.402" offset="1081031">All of these delays were caused by either the absence of the defendant himself from the jurisdiction or, one delay was with the approval of the state there was one joint request for continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.618" offset="1137873">At the trial, the case in chief was presented, and at one point in the hearing, Mrs. Isaacs, the mother of the absent witness, was asked if she knew the whereabouts of her daughter, Anita Isaacs, and her response to that was, "No," she did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.584" offset="1225749">Now, this was during the case in chief, the state's case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.434" offset="1241109">Subsequent to this, the defendant put on his testimony and evidence, and the defense attorney, knowing the plan of the prosecution was to eventually submit evidence of a prior recorded testimony, under oath, of this absent and unavailable witness, requested before Mrs. Isaacs, the mother of the absent witness, could leave the courtroom, requested a voir dire examination for the purposes of discovering whether or not this witness was actually unavailable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.435" offset="4257102">And it is not unavailability due to any neglect on the part of the prosecutor, or any hindrance by the prosecutor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.802" offset="4378624">Because this was not a crucial witness at this point, we were left with whatever means we could have at our disposal to find the witness, once we have some indication of where that witness might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.841" offset="4450722">The question then presented is, where a witness, called by a criminal defendant at a preliminary hearing, testifies in a manner incriminating the defendant, and was not cross-examined, although there was opportunity to do so, and that witness is later shown to be unavailable to testify at the trial, the same defendant on the same charge, does the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment of the constitution of the United States preclude the state's use of an unavailable witness' prior recorded testimony?</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.064" offset="4611636">The use of prior recorded testimony of a witness who is unavailable for trial is not repugnant to the constitution or the confrontation clause of the Sixth amendment, when there are certain indicia of reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.471" offset="4665240">Those indicia of reliability outlined by the various cases that have been cited include a full-fledged judicial hearing with sworn and recorded testimony the defendant being present counsel being present and the opportunity to cross-examine the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.151" offset="4739950">We submit that all of the indicia of reliability were present in this case, plus others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.852" offset="4770774">Secondly, the opportunity to cross-examine the witness is the key to whether the demands of the confrontation clause are met, not whether actual cross-examination took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.494" offset="4817377">And the Ohio Supreme Court, in its dissent, summarizing, Barber, Green and Pointer, which are United States Supreme Court cases on this, said that the extent of the cross-examination, whether at a preliminary hearing or at a trial, is a trial tactic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.788" offset="4890520">The manner of use of that trial tactic does not create a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.881" offset="4926882">Thirdly, the unavailability, the question I believe is not properly before this Court, and the question presented in the petition for certiorari presumes the unavailability, and the respondent did not cross-petition on this issue, which he now attempts to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.227" offset="4988322">Further, both the trial court and the Supreme Court of Ohio have determined the witness to be unavailable as a matter of fact, and that determination should not be disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.773" offset="5034506">Finally, where the testimony is taken at a full-fledged judicial hearing, the opportunity to cross-examine satisfies the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment, regardless of the use made of that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.092" offset="5091767">A full-fledged judicial hearing existed here in this case, which closely approximates a trial.Green mentions factors of a full-fledged hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.948" offset="5131160">And they are, as I mentioned before, the judge hearing the case, the witnesses under oath, the counsel and defendant present, the judicial record to assure the accuracy of the statement and the recording, the opportunity to cross-examine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.819" offset="5274624">And that is this particular witness that we are now confronting this Court with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.635" offset="5301896">Furthermore, besides the standards laid out in Green for a full-fledged hearing, this afforded, in addition, the use of the in the state of Ohio, full use of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.619" offset="5357798">The rules of evidence are mandated for preliminary hearings in the state of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.195" offset="5376188">Compulsory process, the full panoply of the criminal rules and the trial procedures are available for the defendant's use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.103" offset="5419760">Now once we've established that the prior recorded testimony was taken at a full-fledged judicial hearing, then we submit that the opportunity to cross-examine satisfies the confrontation clause, regardless of what use was made of that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.970" offset="5503248">That can be explained by the fact that a witness called on direct knows that they will be subject to cross-examination, and yet whether actual cross-examination takes place is not known until the completion of the direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.500" offset="5573360">Therefore, the motivation to testify truthfully is just as valid before the cross-examination as it could be afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.381" offset="5612857">Secondly, we submit that the confrontation clause is not a right which must be knowingly and voluntarily waived, as certain other Sixth Amendment rights, for example, the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.876" offset="5666879">We submit that the confrontation clause, and the opportunity to cross-examine is comparable to the compulsory process clause which was afforded the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.351" offset="5716825">And regardless of whether or not the defendant makes use of that compulsory process clause, or waives that right, he does not have to waive, or give a knowing and voluntary waiver, of that right to compulsory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.640" offset="5785893">We submit that the opportunity to cross-examine falls within that Sixth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.028" offset="5815463">There have been some objections throughout the briefs raised to this opportunity alone satisfying the confrontation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.734" offset="5850258">The Eleventh district Court of Appeals for the State of Ohio stated that confrontation is a trial right and that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.627" offset="5877844">We do not dispute the fact that the confrontation right is a trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.575" offset="5893622">But it is not an absolute right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.957" offset="5907205">It is a preferential right, as Mattox so noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.979" offset="5923297">According to Mattox, the law in its wisdom declares that the rights of the public shall not be wholly sacrificed in order that an incidental benefit may be preserved to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.391" offset="5972929">The substance of the constitutional protection is preserved to the prisoner in the advantage he has once had of seeing the witness face-to-face, and of subjecting him to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.196" offset="6024129">The second argument that has been raised is the difference in structure between the preliminary hearing and the structure of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.596" offset="6057775">In Ohio the structure of the preliminary hearing follows close to the criminal rules, and provides a full panoply of constitutional safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.391" offset="6096959">The defendant has the absolute right to be present the absolute right to counsel the absolute right to compulsory process the absolute right to cross-examination the full use of the rules of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.781" offset="6142516">He has -- he's entitled to witnesses under oath and a judicial tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.320" offset="6160697">These are absolute rights preserved to a defendant in a preliminary hearing, and they so closely approximate the trial that there is rarely much of a difference in the structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.124" offset="6215868">Thirdly, there is a strategy argument, where counsel at a preliminary hearing may be -- may not use the same strategy as he would at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.634" offset="6269889">But as an advisory opinion, and I believe a well-reasoned opinion, the Sixth federal Circuit Court of Appeals, in Havey v. Kropp, cited in our brief, states that where a state statute exists which allows use of prior recorded testimony, and counsel has notice of the statute, and the attorney chooses not to use the preliminary hearingn -- or chooses to use the preliminary hearing as a fishing expedition or to fail to explore the weaknesses in the State's case, does so at his client's risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.030" offset="6471450">In this case, we do have a state statute in question which was in existence at the time of the preliminary hearing, and was well known to defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.680" offset="6506141">And that state statute, 2945.49 of the Ohio Revised Code provides that prior recorded testimony under oath can be used at a subsequent hearing when the witness is unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.912" offset="6567058">Finally, the defendant in this case actually did make use of his right to confront the witness here, which establishes compliance with the confrontation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.939" offset="6623169">There was de facto cross-examination of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.485" offset="6645321">The totality of the circumstances under which the testimony is taken, including the leading and argumentative questions afforded the jury at trial, a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.600" offset="6705821">Thus we submit that the Supreme Court of Ohio was in error when it held that the prior recorded testimony of an unavailable witness was constitutionally inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.748" offset="6742392">The judgment of that court should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.663" offset="6834030">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.459" offset="6853256">We would wish to expand upon the facts for this Court that petitioner has given to give you some additional information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.436" offset="6889096">In the case at bar, the defendant was arrested -- petitioner was arrested on January 7th, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.489" offset="6921279">His preliminary hearing was had three days later, January 10, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.140" offset="6947924">At that time he had appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.866" offset="6958791">I don't know if the counsel had seen him prior to the preliminary hearing or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.630" offset="6977912">His entire defense -- this is a forgery case, and also some receiving stolen property, some items, a chalice, some silverware -- his entire defense was that his, quote, girlfriend had given him certain items, that she had given him a checkbook written by her father, the complaining witness, and that she gave him permission to use these items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.944" offset="7079163">At the preliminary hearing, which is a probable cause hearing -- and we respectfully differ it is not a trial, the constitutional rights are different -- at the preliminary hearing in this matter, the complaining witness, Mr. Isaacs, Bernard Isaacs, was present, I assume, since I was not the attorney then, because he was to identify the checkbook and to identify the stolen objects, alleged stolen objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.023" offset="7175502">At the time, the defense counsel saw Anita Isaacs in the hallway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.241" offset="7196296">She was not subpoenaed. He called her to the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.063" offset="7207581">He called her to the stand as his witness, subject to direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.038" offset="7231509">There were three or four leading questions, not objected to by the city prosecutor in that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.415" offset="7272991">The witness testified adversely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.469" offset="7285217">The Court of Appeals below stated that you can infer from her actions and her credibility that she was closely linked to the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2310.027" offset="9343457">Our main premise is that petitioner failed to show that Anita Isaacs, the witness herein, was unavailable and -- excuse me, strike that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2324.720" offset="9402284">The preliminary hearing testimony of Anita Isaacs lacked the indicia of reliability necessary for admission as an exception to the confrontation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.699" offset="9442200">To put it on a more national frame, it's our position that where a witness testifies at a preliminary hearing, or any prior recorded matter, be it an examining trial like in Texas, like a magistrate's court in some other jurisdictions, or a preliminary hearing in Ohio, the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the confrontation clause, specifically precludes the use of such recorded testimony, notwithstanding 2945.49, if the witness is not cross-examined, and even if there is cross-examination, if the cross-examination is brief and ineffective, therefore lacking the indicia of reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.150" offset="9611995">It's our position, therefore, that even if this Court, this Honorable Court, determines that she was unavailable, since it was direct examination, since it was not cross-examination, since the preliminary hearing lacked the indicia of reliability as brought out in Dutton v. Evans, the preliminary hearings testimony, the recorded testimony, should not have been admitted in the court in the case at bar below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.185" offset="9724113">We cite to the Court a number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.101" offset="9739786">The Ohio Supreme Court in the Roberts case below talked about -- that the issues must -- at the preliminary hearing-must be similar to the issues at the trial court they use the words "similar enough."</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.558" offset="9797569">And we argue that a preliminary hearing is a probable cause hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.250" offset="9812407">They believe a crime has been committed, and that a defendant has committed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.736" offset="9830275">While a trial is certainly proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2844.713" offset="11482258">In not one of these cases was there a thing where the defense attorney waive cross-examination at a prelim, and then the prior recorded testimony was admissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.001" offset="12891408">And then as we get into them more and more, it turns out that may have seven or eight different witnesses that point the guy out as the one at the scene of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.743" offset="12930382">So our second argument was that this would create havoc in the municipal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.424" offset="12953057">It would require, maybe, half-day, all day preliminary hearings or if the court only adopted his rule in part, it might force us to waive cross-examination on some cases rather than dare even cross-examine for fear of having the compliance with the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.842" offset="13046784">But most likely it would cause extensive prelims.</text>

            <text syncTime="3628.160" offset="14616012">And of course the state of Ohio has rules about time to trial, for speedy trial, and they're statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.884" offset="14634924">The rules require that a criminal defendant, once he has been arrested, be brought to trial with 270 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.158" offset="14660002">If he's incarcerated on that charge without bond, he must be brought to trial within 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.921" offset="14687065">These stipulations and charges that this would cause court congestion were raised, of course, when those statutes came into effect.</text>
