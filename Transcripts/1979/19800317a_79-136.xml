            <text syncTime="59.516" offset="342476">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.994" offset="356373">The question before the Court in this case is whether a living organism is patentable subject matter under Section 101 of the present patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.293" offset="413529">This is a relatively narrow question of statutory interpretation and congressional intent, a question which does not, in our view, require the Court to resolve any of the much mooted current controversies about desirable public policies in the field of so-called genetic engineering.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.728" offset="539335">That is our view, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.482" offset="550306">But the question before the Court is a question of interpreting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.467" offset="574234">The claims at issue were rejected by the Examiner and by the Board of Appeals but were upheld by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.471" offset="622299">They are claims drafted in various forms to a living microorganism to what amounts to a laboratory-induced hybrid strain of bacteria combining in a single organism plasmids which are genetic units that are plasmids that are found in nature to exist only separately in separate strains of these bacteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.574" offset="754688">And the combination of these plasmids in the new strain enable that strain to degrade several components of crude oil simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.483" offset="814352">The Examiner allowed numerous related claims by the Respondent to the process for producing the new strain and claims to an inoculum combining the new strain with certain carrier material.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.868" offset="911841">Some of the rejected claims are also inoculum claims but in those claims the only essential element of the inoculum claimed is the new strain of bacteria itself without any carrier or mixture being specified and those are treated by everyone in the case as essentially claims on the bacteria, just variance of the basic claim for the bacteria.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.164" offset="1041095">Inoculum, something to be inoculated; in this case not in a person but on an oil spill would be the idea of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.310" offset="1101594">Now, perhaps an examiner informed by this Court's analysis in Parker v. Flook would have disallowed some of the claims that were allowed but none of those claims are at issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.138" offset="1172961">There is no mechanism for administrative review of claims allowed by an examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.604" offset="1194799">The Board of Appeals in CCPA did not pass on the validity of those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.186" offset="1225101">But the fact that the process claims were allowed here points up for us what no one really disputes here, that the patent law does apply to new technology, the whole purpose of the patent law is to encourage the development of new technology and to grant rights to inventors who discover new technologies but the claims involving those new technologies in order to be patentable have to be claims that come within the statutory categories established by Congress as the Examiner held the process claims did in this case, as well as the inoculum claims combined bacteria with specified carrier materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.131" offset="1472951">And our basic contention here is that claims on living organisms themselves are not within the statutory categories established by Congress and therefore were properly rejected by the Examiner and the Board of Appeals here.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.136" offset="1560931">And that is all that is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.986" offset="1580366">We start our brief -- the argument in our brief with a quotation from this Court's recent decision in Parker v. Flook that the Judiciary must proceed cautiously when asked to extend patent rights into areas wholly unforeseen by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.521" offset="1918495">Our contention is that this would be an extension unforeseen by Congress but not an area wholly unforeseen by Congress, because for the last 50 years Congress has dealt quite specifically with hybridization of living organisms in patent statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.183" offset="2009088">And this is the heart of our case, that Congress has for 50 years built a statutory edifice on the premise that the language that is now in section 101 about patents on manufacturers or compositions of matter does not apply to living organisms and they have made specific provision for patenting of various categories of organisms with a great many exclusions and a great many specifically tailored provisions, all based on the premise that those categories are not included within the general authorization for patents on discoveries of manufacturers or compositions of matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.852" offset="2319841">There was a patent issued to Pasteur for an apparatus and method of purifying yeast and that included a claim on the yeast so purified without mentioning any specific strain which others would be excluded from manufacturing or using.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.515" offset="2402492">Whether that patent was properly granted is something that no court has ever passed on.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.955" offset="2580229">But our basic contention is that the disputes among the parties about the actions of particular examiners in uncontested and unreviewed matters over a period of many years, there being some thousand examiners in the Patent Office today dealing with some 100,000 applications a year and there being almost 4,200,000 patents that have been granted cumulatively in the course of the years, that the disputes about what particular examiners have done in accepting or rejecting, allowing or disallowing particular claims are relatively inconsequential in this case in light of the specific attention that Congress has given the issue here and the fact that there has never been an articulated policy of the Patent Office to grant patents on living organisms brought to the attention of Congress and no indication that Congress ever acquiesced in any such interpretation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.799" offset="2871547">When this is combined with the history of the last 50 years of building a statutory edifice on the premise that patents cannot be issued on living organisms --</text>

            <text syncTime="710.110" offset="2944794">It is conceded and very clear that section 101 of the Act does not make patentable any product of nature.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="721.621" offset="2990874">But what Congress has dealt with for the past 50 years are man-made hybrids that do no occur in nature and the extent to which patentability should be available on those organisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.284" offset="3053568">And we start in examining this history of congressional treatment with the 1930 Plant Patent Act itself which amended what is now section 101 of the patent law to read as we have reproduced it on page 22 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.968" offset="3148236">Before the 1952 recodification of the patent code for 22 years after the enactment of the 1930 law which is now section 101 read as is set forth on page 22 of our brief, saying any person who has invented or discovered any new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter or any new and useful improvements or who has invented or discovered and asexually reproduced any distinct and new variety of plant other than a tuber-propagated plant may obtain a patent therefor.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.448" offset="3310195">It is obvious to us on the fact of that that Congress was not operating on the premise that any distinct new variety of plant was a category already included within any new manufacture or composition of matter, otherwise the exclusion of tuber-propagated plant from the latter category would have ambiguities to it and could have been interpreted as a contraction of patent rights when Congress treated the Act as an expansion of patent rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.875" offset="3479886">And this is not left merely to the face of the statute but in both House and Senate committee reports appended in full a letter from Secretary Hyde, the Secretary of Agriculture, stating -- we have set forth this letter on pages 24 and 25 of our brief -- stating very specifically that the purpose of the law is to bring reproduction of newly bred our found plants under the patent laws which at the present time are understood to cover only inventions or discoveries in the field of inanimate nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.872" offset="3671834">Now, various efforts are made to explain why this may not be a completely authoritative interpretation of the then existing patent laws but the fact of the matter is both houses appended this as Appendix A to their committee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.908" offset="3748007">Those reports have only one other appendix, Appendix B, the text of the new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.863" offset="3779877">This is not a letter that is buried in a whole list of communications that are appended.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.400" offset="3805999">There is nothing said in either report to cast any doubt on Secretary Hyde's interpretation of the then existing patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.330" offset="3845705">Indeed, the reports are entirely consistent with that interpretation and in particular both reports have an identical series of paragraphs which begin with the sentence "Furthermore, there is no apparent difference, for instance, between the part played by the plant originator in the development of new plants and the part played by the chemist in the development of new composition of matter which are patentable under existing law."</text>
            <text syncTime="970.782" offset="3987498">And then there is for several paragraphs a comparison of the chemist's development of compositions of matter and the breeder's development of plants and the terminology is always used distinctively.</text>

            <text syncTime="1106.306" offset="4529591">And everything that was written and said is consistent with this premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.810" offset="4551638">The next development was the 1940 Court of Customs and Patent Appeals decision which we cite in our brief in re Arzbergex, which interpreted the plant patent provisions of this paragraph as not covering a claim on bacteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.253" offset="4637424">There was an effort to get a plant patent at that time on a microorganism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.551" offset="4654561">It was rejected by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.809" offset="4715583">Perhaps no claim could have been made because of the difficulty of meeting the description requirement for anything other than a plant patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.180" offset="4757065">But what is interesting from our standpoint is that no one on the Board of Appeals or the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals mentioned in passing or in any way that perhaps such an organism could qualify as a manufacturer composition of matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.514" offset="5010453">The claim was not rejected by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals for obviousness or for lack of novelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.352" offset="5037829">It was rejected to because they interpreted the Plant Patent Act as not applying to a claim for a bacterium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.877" offset="5071893">The question was whether a bacterium was a plant within the meaning of that Act and they said that was not what Congress had in mind, all excepting the premise that it was novel, useful and not obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.897" offset="5119958">There may be some question about that but that was the premise of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.413" offset="5142006">Then the next event chronologically was the 1952 recodification of the patent laws in which no question was raised in Congress or by the drafters about the validity of any of the premises on which the Plant Patent Act was enacted or had been interpreted and these provisions were separated out at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.474" offset="5246286">The next event chronologically in this history of 50 years of congressional consideration of hybridization, and that is all we are involved with here, that the techniques in this laboratory are more sophisticated than the techniques of Luther, Burbank and the other plant breeders but what is produced is a hybrid living organism, basically the same kind of product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.846" offset="5347746">The next event chronologically are the proposals leading to the Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970 and on page 14 of our brief in the first paragraph of Footnote 12 we mention the series of proposals by the Patent Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.442" offset="5446175">Some of them don't specify whether they thought existing law could not extend this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.797" offset="5471566">Others do specify quite specifically, as this 1966 resolution of the American Bar Association Patent Section did, it was entitled "Extension of Patent System to Biological Arts Not Now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.751" offset="5539380">Covered" and it favored coverage specifically for microorganisms and animal husbandry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.657" offset="5571041">And as a matter of fact in following up these many proposals -- we have recounted a number of them there -- we note on page 29 of our brief in Footnote 35 that in the course of consideration of the Plant Variety Protection Act a representative of this Patent Section of the American Bar Association referred to this series of resolutions and to bills that had been proposed at the behest and with the support of the ABA by Senator McClellan with respect to patent protection for microorganisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.848" offset="5743762">There had been bills introduced by him but no hearings held on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.951" offset="5768213">And when the Plant Variety Protection Act was enacted it contained a specific exclusion for bacteria as well as for fungi and for first generation hybrids against this background of advocacy of inclusion of bacteria because of their lack of present coverage by the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.651" offset="5878972">And the reports that were issued at that time by the Congress in 1970 by both committees, the important paragraph is set out on page 28 of our brief, and those reports are much more specific in agreeing with the position that Secretary Hyde had taken in 1930 that no protection is available under the then existing laws to varieties of plants which reproduce sexually, that is generally by seed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.452" offset="6034244">This was an extension of a patent-type protection that went beyond the 1930 Act which was limited to asexual reproduction which would have to be by cuttings or grafting and for the first time went into the field where there might be biological reproduction uncontrolled by the patentee or his licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.178" offset="6169140">And the limitations that were specified on the kind of patent protection to be given were much more extensive than the limitations under the 1930 Act which dealt only with asexual reproduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.863" offset="6243850">And there were a number of exclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.925" offset="6252105">Okra, celery, peppers, tomatoes, carrots and cucumbers were specifically excluded by one provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.160" offset="6281049">The authorizing provision itself excludes fungi bacteria and first generation hybrids.</text>

            <text syncTime="1747.084" offset="7092726">The Constitution provides for the Congress obtaining power to grant patents in order to advance the useful arts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.889" offset="7127939">I think it is conceded here that the constitutional power is there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.556" offset="7166600">In our submission it has and it has in two different categories of statutory language.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.179" offset="7213098">It also has provided for the granting of patents on compositions of matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1880.552" offset="7626564">That may well be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.042" offset="7636595">The problem I think is whether it is an invention, and that is the problem that was addressed by the Congress in 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.434" offset="7662090">But that is a different problem than we are concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.444" offset="7674211">We are concerned with here something that was not merely extracted from nature and sought to be patented but rather something that was then acted upon by man to change an essential characteristic and to enable it therefore to degrade a number of components of oil simultaneously, which is something that the prior existing microorganisms could not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.734" offset="7771282">it has been provided with an additional characteristic and I submit that under the decisions of this Court, particularly in American Plant v. Brogdex it qualifies as a manufacture for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.687" offset="7827184">We have here a finding of fact, in effect, by the Patent Office administrative agency which is charged with making such findings, namely the Board of Appeals, that this was not a product of nature and it therefore is a manufacture and it is patentable in our submission as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.314" offset="7897610">Now, the prime position taken by the Government previously in this case has been that the policy of the Patent Office has always been to refuse to grant patents on living subject matter and that this represents a change of that policy, therefore an extension of the patent law into an area never previously foreseen by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.435" offset="7986113">Now, we answered that argument by pointing out that there was no evidence adduced that showed that particular conclusion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.917" offset="8016102">There was no support for the contention the Government made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.086" offset="8028745">Moreover, we brought forward several different kinds of evidence which do show that the policy of the Patent Office in the past has been to grant patents on living subject matter in appropriate circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.139" offset="8084961">Now, the Government appears to want now to step aside from that whole issue and they now say that their primary thrust is on a different issue entirely, namely the history of the Plant Patent Act and the Plant Variety Protection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.750" offset="8143370">And our submission the reason they want to do that is we have shown that their initial premise in seeking certiorari in this case is erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2059.507" offset="8342424">That patent was to a mixture of bacteria, the same kind of thing for which claims are sought here and the Patent Office in that case had granted the patent on the bacteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.170" offset="8385055">It was found to be invalid in this Court for a different reason but not because it was directed to living subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.331" offset="8413686">We referred to that case in our brief, the Government responded by saying well, that really was dealing with a different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.058" offset="8444615">But the point is that it was claiming bacteria and it was claiming bacteria alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.341" offset="8465721">So that there is an instance of the Patent Office not only having granted the patent but now seeking to say that that is not the situation that we are faced with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.766" offset="8507413">In our submission it is the same situation we are faced with here but for one point that makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.718" offset="8535312">The point is that in that case the bacteria were a mixture of different species, each of which was old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.310" offset="8565614">In this case we are dealing with a single species which is new.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.654" offset="8583064">But they are both living things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.972" offset="8592259">If a patent cannot be granted on one because it is alive, then a patent cannot be granted on the other because it is alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.862" offset="8623815">But the Government appears now to take the position that the patented bacterium in the Funk v. Kalo case was even though it was alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.816" offset="8671671">I don't know whether you noticed the emphasis that was placed on a word in the argument by my friend here a little earlier and that was "alone" or "themselves."</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.385" offset="8713885">The Government appears now to have switched its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.461" offset="8726215">They are now saying that in the case of claims to bacteria, micro-organisms alone, or themselves, then the policy has always been never to grant such patents, not the policy has been to refuse patents on living things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.798" offset="8795596">It is a totally different thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.380" offset="8801865">Now, we adduced proof of a number of different patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.994" offset="8824330">Mr. Chief Justice, you just referred to that at page 50, I think, of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.395" offset="8845960">There are some 68 patents in that list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.941" offset="8856200">The Government says as to most of those patents they are directed to old subject matter, as if that made it different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.833" offset="8891726">The subject matter is alive whether it is old or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.482" offset="8906355">As to some 14 patents, and their brief and Footnote 2 is associated with this, in their brief they say as to those 14 patents they are directed to new subject matter but additional material beyond the living subject matter is claimed, as if that changed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.215" offset="8977304">The subject matter is alive whether it has something combined with it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.101" offset="8996843">My point really is that the living nature of the thing is not what has prevented it from being patented in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.748" offset="9027354">The Patent Office attitude has been to grant patents on living things if they met the other criteria such as not being products of nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.052" offset="9232572">There may be some others but I don't think the point is really worth exploring as to how many others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.663" offset="9255037">But my point is that the thing does not become dead, unliving because it is combined together with something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.890" offset="9287952">Really I think the way this arose in the course of history in the Patent Office is as follows Somebody came around with a new-found kind of bacteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.725" offset="9327344">They found that it was useful in doing something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.821" offset="9339674">They went to the Patent Office with a request to patent this and the Patent Office said, "Well, no, you just took something that was found in nature, it is a product of nature."</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.474" offset="9374260">Then, the applicant being rather inventive anyway, said, "Well, now, I will claim that together with something in which it is not found in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.582" offset="9410727">For instance I will claim it with an insecticidal carrier and now I have an insecticidal composition and you ought to grant me that patent."</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.386" offset="9445940">And the Examiner says, "I must agree with you because it is not found together with the carrier."</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.257" offset="9465375">We have an illustration of that in this very case, because several of the claims in this case, the allowed claims, cover the combination of a bacterium with a carrier, namely straw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.672" offset="9515112">That bacteria is not found in straw in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.829" offset="9527756">Therefore it is not a product of nature but it is still alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.510" offset="9546459">Now, I don't think that the Government has justified the distinction between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.951" offset="9564223">And the reason I emphasize this is to point out that the policy of the Government until very recently here has been uniform and that is to not deny patents on living things but rather to deny patents on products of nature, whether they are living or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.245" offset="9633395">Now, in this case we have pointed out in addition to the number of patents that we have identified and also the cases that we have referred to we pointed out the Patent Office has established official classifications of patents on living things, the reason being of course that they have a sufficient number of patents that they want a place to put them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.574" offset="9714688">They have responded to our showing in respect of one sub class only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.422" offset="9734123">That sub class is embarrassing to them I think because it calls for patents on microorganisms alone, or themselves or per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.585" offset="9770695">And that is where they are now reduced to in their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.413" offset="9786055">They say microorganisms alone are not patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.165" offset="9797026">But we have pointed out that they have a sub class on microorganisms alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.290" offset="9817506">Their answer to that is that the international authorities wanted a sub class to be set up for that kind of thing, presumably because in a national patent law this kind of thing is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.916" offset="9876020">Then they also say, "Well, we have so many patents on living things that have been granted that we have to find a place to put them."</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.304" offset="9909561">Now, we have also pointed as another form of evidence to the Board decision in one case, the Farr case that is identified in our brief, the reason for doing this is that they said in their brief after our response to their petition for certiorari pointed out that this kind of thing existed, they said, "Well, the Board of Appeals and the Commissioner have always had the policy that patents would not be granted on living things."</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.639" offset="10022933">But we pointed to a Board of Appeals decision in which a patent was granted by that Board reversing an Examiner and that patent was directed to a living thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.540" offset="10066505">We have also pointed to Commissioner Watson's statement to a congressional committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.681" offset="10091165">Commissioner was a Commissioner of Patents in the "Fifties under the Eisenhower years and during his submission to the Congress he said patents are granted on cultures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.694" offset="10135155">Well, cultures are nothing but groups of microorganisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.757" offset="10155426">They now seek to interpret that away by saying that he must have been referring to a process of doing something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.763" offset="10179459">But he doesn't say anything about a process of doing something, he refers to cultures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.491" offset="10198371">And cultures were what was claimed in the patent involved in Funk v. Kalo, this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.762" offset="10235465">So I think that the evidence rather indicates that patents have been granted over many, many years on living things if, as I say, they met the statutory criteria in other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.790" offset="10287606">This is not a case such as Parker v. Flook in which somebody seeks to extend the patent protection to a wholly different area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.841" offset="10327730">This is rather one in which patent protection has been granted over the years and now the administrative agency seeks to change that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.782" offset="10359495">In our submission that is their job, to go to Congress and get permission for such a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.474" offset="10386244">I would like to refer for a few moments to the statutory history of the Plant Patent Act, because the Government apparently is now placing its primary reliance upon that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.744" offset="10431384">In 1930 we were at a situation, rightly or wrongly, in which patents were not being granted on plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.246" offset="10465343">Plant breeders were desirous of obtaining patent protection for their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.050" offset="10484569">They went to the Congress and asked for congressional authority for the Patent Office to grant patents on plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.277" offset="10509542">They obtained such authority by way of the Plant Patent Act of 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.708" offset="10531276">Now, whether or not the Patent Office should have denied patents on plants prior to to 1930 is really not significant here but that appears to be what the Government is really saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.191" offset="10573176">What the Government is saying is that the plant breeder was doing very much the same kind of thing as Dr. Chakrabarty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.224" offset="10601284">Well, I think they were doing something rather different, but I don't think it is worth belaboring the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.722" offset="10619256">The point, however, is that plants were not being patented prior to 1930 and the Congress provided for the granting of patents on plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.608" offset="10658858">There is not one word in that entire statutory history that indicates that the Congress thought that patents could not be granted on living subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.903" offset="10696056">It is just not there; it is not there expressly and it is not there compliedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.408" offset="10717999">Much is made out of Secretary of Agriculture Hyde's letter but that letter was relied on only for two things, which have nothing whatever to do with the statement which is quoted by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.590" offset="10770766">That letter is relied upon by the congressional committees for the expertise that the Agriculture Department has in identifying varieties of plants and they are suggesting that the Patent Office may want to come to them for assistance in distinguishing between the various varieties of plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.010" offset="10844432">There is another point, which slips my mind at the moment, which is expressly mentioned in the statutory history in the committee reports.</text>

            <text syncTime="3080.565" offset="12426616">There is a merit to this deposit system that is very important with respect to the granting of patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.174" offset="12457127">If patents are foreclosed in this particular area, then there will be incentive to keep the microorganism secret, trade secret law would then protect the microorganism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.836" offset="12511775">And one would not deposit the microorganism with one of these deposit systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.480" offset="12538316">With patent protection possible it is required by the patent law that there be such a deposit and therefore that the microorganism be available to future researchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.981" offset="12580321">But if that availability of patents is removed and therefore the requirement to deposit is also removed, then it will not be possible to build research upon research, which is the way most research occurs.</text>
