            <label>Mr. Paul C. Matthews</label>
            <text syncTime="16.797" offset="67187">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.616" offset="82442">This morning I had already discussed the compelling analogy between the right of the widow to recover for loss of society and that of a wife of a badly crippled worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.703" offset="150779">I would like to spend the remainder of my time discussing the decision of Judge Friendly in the Ignerie case, discussing the Christofferson case, and discussing the contentions of the petitioner with regard to the uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.545" offset="226116">With regard to Ignerie, I believe that the decision of Judge Friendly was not in any way dogmatic, did not intend to be engraved in stone, but rather was invitational and that it left open a door through which the Alvez court, the Court of Appeals for the State of New York stepped through in the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.045" offset="352131">Judge Friendly wrote in Ignerie, "If there were evidence that maritime law generally recognized a claim for negligent injury to such an intangible right, or if the common law clearly authorized a wife's recovery, the gravitational pull of such concepts with respect to the wife of a longshoreman might be stronger than that of the analogy to the statute denying such a recovery to a seaman's wife."</text>
            <text syncTime="116.710" offset="466756">At the time, in 1963, when Judge Friendly wrote those words, 19 jurisdictions had denied the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.264" offset="517016">Of those 19, today 15 have reversed the law so that we have at the present time only four jurisdictions of those 19, plus one additional, that being Louisiana where the right has been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.905" offset="591517">In addition, Judge Friendly indicated that the rights were too personal, too intangible and too conjectural to be determined by a jury, but that contention was answered by this Court in Gaudet which indicated that the same argument could be made with regard to any damages for pain and suffering and which indeed indicated that for many, many years, indeed centuries, that courts and juries had been called upon to pass upon the right for loss of consortium.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.595" offset="750341">With regard to a contention I think that was made or a mention in Judge Friendly's opinion, that the damages were parasitic in nature, this I think was well answered by the court below, by Judge Jasen who said, referring to a wife, in the good times she lights the hearth with her own inimitable glow, but when tragedy strikes it is part of her unique glory that forsaking the shelter, the comfort, the warmth of the home, she puts her arm and shoulder to the plow.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.889" offset="907494">We are now at the heart of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.491" offset="917943">In such circumstances when her husband's love is denied her, his strength sapped and his protection destroyed, in short, when she has been forced by the defendant to exchange a heart for a husk, we are urged to rule that she has suffered no loss compensable at the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.969" offset="995788">But let some scoundrel dent a dishpan in the family kitchen and the law in all its majesty will convene the court, will march with measured tread to the halls of justice and will there suffer a jury of her peers to assess the damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.254" offset="1068931">Why are we asked then in this case to look the other way?</text>
            <text syncTime="271.888" offset="1087530">Is this what is meant when it is said that justice is blind?"</text>

            <text syncTime="286.838" offset="1147298">I think, Your Honor, that Congress has quite clearly delegated this area to this Court, and I think that in the Fitzgerald case this Court recognized its duty and its responsibility in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.352" offset="1229322">So I don't think it is something that in any means is within the province of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.046" offset="1308108">Of course they could do so, but the fact that they have not done so one way or the other is nothing that should be influential on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.837" offset="1355337">As this Court indicated in the opinion in Moragne, Congress has specifically left to this Court the duty in the maritime law of declaring what the rights of injured persons should be.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.590" offset="1426286">That is not quite the same as saying it is not within the province of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.311" offset="1441228">The power of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.956" offset="1447811">I would be the last to deny that, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.226" offset="1468813">This Court indicated in Moragne that certainly it better becomes the humane and liberal character of proceedings in admiralty to give then to withhold the remedy when not required to do so by established and inflexible rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.534" offset="1534119">The basis for the statement that a blue-water seaman does not have or the wife of a blue-water seaman does not have this right is in the Christofferson case, where the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit considered the right of the wife on three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.676" offset="1622622">First, they considered the Jones Act, which they found did not allow this remedy, based upon Judge Friendly's decision in Ignerie.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.057" offset="1664209">Secondly, they found that with respect to the claim for unseaworthiness, there was no right because of the decision of Judge Friendly in Ignerie.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.553" offset="1710184">And thirdly, they found that there was no right under the law of the State of Louisiana where the injury had occurred by examining the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.049" offset="1752189">This I think, without trying to read their minds, had to do probably with the decision of this Court in Just v. Chambers which indicated that the law of the states may be used to fill in voids in the maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.480" offset="1817913">So we have a situation where, according to the Christofferson case, is some 44 of the jurisdictions of this country, such a remedy would be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.814" offset="1871203">In the name of uniformity, the petitioner in this case would have you to turn back the clock on almost half a century of progressive decisions, affirming the concern of admiralty for the welfare of those injured within its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.467" offset="1937868">I would just point out further that aligning the maritime law with the overwhelming majority of states will eliminate confusion where a single injury may result from violation of duties owed under state law by one defendant and maritime law by another, and it would be a situation similar to that which is involved in the Consolidated Machines case cited by the petitioner in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.706" offset="2062733">Now, if I have any time left, I would mention what I concede to be the role of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="595.010" offset="2379964">The respondent would urge that no distinction be made between the measure of damages in the fatal and non-fatal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.709" offset="2426776">In doing so, he would ask the Court to make a distinction between longshoremen and the wives of longshoremen and seamen and their wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.351" offset="2465332">It is petitioner's position that it makes eminently better sense if a distinction has to be made to make that distinction between life and death than it does to make an artificial distinction between longshoremen and their progeny and their wives and seamen and their wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.113" offset="2572434">The longshoremen's rights are a derivative from seamen and to elevate the status of a longshoremen and his wife to a position above the employee from whom he derives his rights makes no sense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.174" offset="2644637">If respondent's position were to be accepted, it would mean that every time a longshoremen is injured, whether it be a bump, a scrape, a laceration, a bruise, he would be accompanied in his lawsuit by a spouse seeking sentimental damages.</text>
