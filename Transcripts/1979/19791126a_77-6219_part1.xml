            <text syncTime="71.560" offset="389622">This case concerns an Illinois conviction of a petitioner sentenced for theft under an enhanced penalty statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.478" offset="421282">The charge that the petitioner was facing was the theft of a dial massage shower head, having a value of less than $150.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.762" offset="462451">He was charged with taking that from Montgomery Ward on November 13, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.345" offset="484707">Now, this information also charged as an additional element that this was his second theft conviction, the first occurring in May of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.868" offset="526817">Ordinarily, under Illinois, had there only been one theft conviction charged in the statute, the punishment would have been classified as a misdemeanor and he would have been punished by up to less than one year with no parole and the incarceration could have taken place in other than a penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.067" offset="607692">However, in Illinois, under this enhanced penalty statute, upon a second conviction the penalty would be classified as a felony punishable one to three years, with two years of automatic parole followed, and that also the incarceration would occur in a penitentiary as opposed to a jail or another institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="180.444" offset="825135">For example, under the Illinois statute, the new sentencing statute, the petitioner could be exposed to an extended term upon conviction of the same class felony on the basis of his prior felony, and this statute involved there is chapter 38, section 1005-5(3)(2)(b), and also 1005-8-2(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="210.579" offset="945716">There may also be ramifications with regard to the petitioner's future employment on the basis of this felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.775" offset="1458448">Your Honors, at trial there was an objection to the entry of this prior misdemeanor conviction which was uncounseled.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.414" offset="1497004">The basis of the objection was Burgett v. Texas, and defense counsel made the objection stating that she felt that the evidence would show that he was not represented by counsel at the prior misdemeanor proceedings, but that the state had an affirmative showing to show that he was represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.216" offset="1588224">What happened was that the court overruled the objection and said that this did not apply to felony proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.057" offset="1615600">On appeal, the conviction was affirmed over the dissent of one judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.864" offset="1634826">Our petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court was denied, and this Court granted certiorari on the question of whether the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the use of the prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction which did not result in imprisonment to increase the sentence of imprisonment on a subsequent conviction under an enhanced penalty statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.113" offset="1799816">I think in sum our argument is that the prior uncounseled conviction, even though valid for purposes of a fine, is not valid for purposes of incarceration.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="435.596" offset="1845791">Would you contend that if a judge in his sentencing had a range in the indeterminate sentence approach and the pre-sentence report excludes all the facts that are disclosed in this case, that he was constitutionally barred from taking that into account in fixing a sentence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_mulder" startTime="461.321" stopTime="554.878">
            <label>Mr. Michael Mulder</label>
            <text syncTime="461.321" offset="1948609">I think that the Sixth Amendment would prohibit that under Tucker v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.468" offset="1977240">I think that that is much closer a question than our case at bar now because in our case at bar the imprisonment flows as a "but for" consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.242" offset="2028335">In other words, when you face the enhanced penalty situation in Illinois, upon that second conviction being proved up, the judge has a whole new range of options.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.125" offset="2071907">Instead of less than one year, he now imposes one to three, with the parole to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.844" offset="2098761">But I think the problem with your -- with that argument, which I believe the amicus makes, that if hearsay statements can come into the presentence report and if arrest reports can come into the presentence report, why can't we use these uncounseled convictions which are at least as reliable as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.370" offset="2176815">Ordinarily, when counsel approaches the bench at such a sentencing hearing, he can argue that the hearsay isn't worth very much or that the arrest record doesn't mean very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.124" offset="2227911">But the problem with the amicus argument is that they want to use that conviction for full value, they want to treat it like any other conviction with counsel, and I think that is the real danger involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.843" offset="2278693">So I think the better approach -- and again I think the analogy can be made to Tucker v. United States -- is that that shouldn't flow from the conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.631" offset="2365942">Well, I think in the same manner that Tucker v. United States distinguished Williams, and that was that where there was no counsel at that prior conviction, the court would look at it in a different manner and therefore it could not be used at the sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.343" offset="2440756">And I think what our argument is that it is not reliable to impose imprisonment and therefore should not be looked at at the sentencing hearing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Mulder</label>
            <text syncTime="602.947" offset="2515153">That's true, and admittedly it is a closer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.865" offset="2526856">But I think if we can say from the sentencing hearing that the additional imprisonment resulted from that prior uncounseled conviction, that the better approach would be not to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.792" offset="2574503">But again I say that the consequence, the collateral consequence in our case is a lot more direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.916" offset="2607000">It is the "but for" causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.388" offset="2616926">And I think the analogy to Burgett can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.292" offset="2636570">In Burgett, it was reversed on the basis of an invalid conviction under Gideon v. Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.733" offset="2670320">Admittedly, as I spoke before, the conviction here is valid but the defect in Burgett was the lack of counsel, and that is the same defect that existed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.698" offset="2718177">And our argument is that the fact that imprisonment was imposed on Burgett does not add any reliability to that conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.745" offset="2758301">In Burgett, the court found that Burgett was suffering anew from that uncounseled conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.366" offset="2784841">And although petitioner Baldasar did not suffer initially imprisonment, he is in a sense suffering imprisonment for the first time at the subsequent proceeding, so that he too suffers anew from the uncounseled conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="696.449" offset="2889122">But our point is that the defect underlying the reasoning in Burgett was lack of counsel, and he has no counsel at that prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="996.692" offset="4090128">I would suggest to the Court that a rule could be easily applied here and simply applied If the state seeks to enhance imprisonment, they must show that the prior conviction that the defendant was either represented by counsel or waived counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.181" offset="4156061">Further, they claim that it is very difficult for the prosecutor or the trial court judge to predict whether or not this conviction would be used sometime down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.148" offset="4199946">I would suggest to the Court that it is not a hard decision to make that prediction and it is based on some of the same things that they predict initially on whether to grant the petitioner counsel or not, and that is the nature of the offense, the circumstances involved, whether there was violence or injury to any person, and whether a pattern of criminal conduct is developing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.434" offset="4301093">If those things appear, then the tate can keep their option open to use this at a later enhancement, to use this as later enhancing the sentence by providing counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.329" offset="4372668">First of all, I would say that if it is true that the Sixth Amendment prohibits the use of these convictions, then cost may be irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.877" offset="4410911">But the amicus and the respondent argue it, so I would like to address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.452" offset="4429197">I think one thing that is clear if the Court agrees with our position, and that would be that the same option that was left open in Argersinger and Scott still exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.566" offset="4473605">That is that if the state chooses not to provide counsel, it doesn't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.471" offset="4497220">It can simply forego the option of imprisonment so that no cost would result to the state in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.476" offset="4541315">Well, from the cost point of view, though, the reason for the state foregoing the cost in the initial round where there isn't any threat of imprisonment is that it is just a great big three-million square-mile country where it isn't always that easy in lots of non-metropolitan areas to obtain counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1707.994" offset="6935385">We believe that any other conclusion would substantially undercut this Court's opinion in Scott and would create untold confusion among state and federal courts as to the possible collateral uses of valid convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.534" offset="6981465">For example, as the Chief Justice indicated, we believe that a ruling in petitioner's favor would lead to similar challenges as to whether or not a prior counselless conviction could be used in a presentence report, whether it could be used for purposes of impeachment, the same type of situation that did arise after this Court's decisions after Burgett and Loper and United States v.

            <text syncTime="1770.297" offset="7184593">I suggest that a judge would in effect have to have a prophecy to make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.796" offset="7206536">I think it is quite possible even that a conservative judge might appoint counsel in all cases.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1792.025" offset="7271424">Many states do precisely that, you know.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael B. Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="1794.078" offset="7279679">Many states do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.471" offset="7285217">However, we felt both in Scott and in this case that counsel was not required at this first misdemeanor conviction as long as incarceration did not result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.116" offset="7335790">Therefore, we believe that a decision in favor of the petitioner could well lead to appointment of counsel in all cases due to either cautious judges or perhaps cautious prosecutors, a result which this Court rejected in Argersinger and specifically in Scott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.369" offset="7400887">With regard to the amount of sentences that might be involved here, the Illinois Supreme Court noted at least thirty enhancement sentences in Illinois that would be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.996" offset="7443310">The amicus has done a brief survey of those sentences around the United States as well as in the federal system, and I think we are talking about more than just a minor amount of sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.496" offset="7489390">Thus there would be substantial costs to the state and to the judicial system, the same types of costs which a majority of this Court recognized in Scott, and therefore chose not to require counsel at misdemeanor convictions not leading to imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.950" offset="7551143">The instant sentence therefore is a direct result only of a second conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.819" offset="7582699">It is not a delayed or additional punishment for the first uncounseled conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.265" offset="7600462">Additionally, it is the petitioner's voluntary act of committing the second theft that most directly led to his incarceration for one to three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.083" offset="7639751">As to reliability, Burgett and the later cases of Loper and United States v. Tucker dealt with convictions which were presumptively void under Gideon v. Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.694" offset="7682173">There is no question but that a void conviction is clearly unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.214" offset="7700250">However, here the petitioner could have attacked his first conviction via direct appeal, a post-hearing act, a quorum novis petition, or perhaps federal habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.832" offset="7738702">The fact that he chose not to is further indication, indeed possibly a presumption of its correctness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.707" offset="7770154">The respondents believe that under the facts presented herein, the counselless conviction is no less reliable from a conviction obtained after perhaps a waiver of counsel or a Faretta situation where defendant insisted upon his personal right to represent himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1938.978" offset="7859284">I simply say that in the positive way because that is the way it was stated in Faretta, where the opposite term, simply waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.645" offset="7890004">To insist that a conviction is valid yet unreliable simply does not make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.274" offset="7912469">In summary, Your Honors, the respondents believe that a ruling in favor of the petitioner would only open up a "pandora's box" at substantial costs to the criminal justice system and to society in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.973" offset="7959280">Moreover, we believe that it would completely abrogate this Court's previous decisions in Argersinger and Scott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.318" offset="7980596">Therefore, Your Honors, we respectfully urge that this Honorable Court affirm the judgments of the Illinois courts.</text>
