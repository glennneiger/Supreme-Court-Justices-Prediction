            <text syncTime="51.887" offset="310941">This case, Vance v. Universal Amusement Company, has had a very long, tortuous history, starting off with a number of separate cases in the State of Texas and some 20 of those cases being consolidated before one three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.256" offset="396413">As a consequence, many issues got obscured.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.890" offset="430895">But I think that the issue that is presented today is clear and that is whether or not there can be any prior restraint imposed in the First Amendment area. Can there be any; if procedures that protect First Amendment rights are adopted, can there then be the type of thing we have here, an injunction against the future showing of, in this case obscene movies even though those particular movies have never been judicially determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.579" offset="1881736">But I would like to clear up some of the things that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.740" offset="1926353">4667 is involved, and that statute says if the habitual use of -- or of premises for a certain purpose will be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.311" offset="1992600">It says the use, and not the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.246" offset="2000332">That is why we were saying no prosecutor really tried to apply in the State of Texas 4666 and close the place for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.829" offset="2038680">The reason they didn't is because there was under the old obscenity statute, before it was amended some years ago, a section 13 which permitted enjoining premises for obscene -- the use of premises for obscene matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.636" offset="2125928">And that did not permit closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.431" offset="2137109">So when the obscenity statute was amended, and the injunction provisions removed, no one -- at least in the prosecution area, that I know of -- ever considered trying to padlock for a year, which is provided for in 4666.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.142" offset="2227911">It just didn't occur to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.164" offset="2240031">Now, as far as the prior restraint, the other question in this case is whether an injunction can be drawn that enjoins the use of premises for the future showing of pictures which have not been judicially determined to be obscene where the injunction is drawn in explicit terms as far as the sexual conduct enjoined and also cites the requirements of Miller.</text>

            <text syncTime="906.292" offset="3728488">A temporary injunction is appealed in Texas and, by the way, in Texas as in the Federal courts the hearing on the temporary injunction is usually the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.855" offset="3762761">And very often, probably more often than not, attorneys agree that the temporary injunction and the permanent injunction hearing will be held at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.164" offset="3795989">So the evidence is presented there and for all practical purposes that is the end of the case, because everybody has put on just about everything he has at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.276" offset="3840502">A temporary injunction is appealable in Texas, it is an expedited appeal, the record must be filed in 20 days, and the court can consider it even without briefs in order to expedite consideration on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.794" offset="3886582">So this kind of injunction does have that protection in expedited appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.396" offset="3908942">But here is where we come to, I guess to me, the proposition that makes me wonder why we have come all this except it is a matter of principle, and I shouldn't have said what I said.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.348" offset="3976756">But in Texas when there is a contempt hearing -- all right, we have an injunction against some premises enjoining the showing of obscene movies.</text>

            <text syncTime="985.523" offset="4045511">The complainant, who ordinarily would be the county or district attorney, must come into court and prove that the injunction has been violated, which means for any move to be shown or any book to be displayed in a book store he has got to go through the same type of proof that he would if he defiled a criminal obscenity case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2073.212" offset="8396257">And when you have got that, then the Judge could be faced with magazines, motion picture films, books, anything like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2260.694" offset="9146180">Under this case, if I continue to show the motion picture the Judge can say, I told you, you are under an injunction and you are both civil and criminal because it is past actions of showing it and in the future you can't show this unnamed picture now identified any more.</text>

            <text syncTime="2315.724" offset="9366235">The contempt, the injunction, becomes just the same thing as a criminal statute.</text>

Alabama some people won't want to challenge the fact when they have an injunction, whereas if they are distributing a magazine or a book or a motion picture which has some isolated incident of sex act in it, are they going to say that this freezes, it doesn't just chill, it freezes the provisions and becomes what I believe is an impermissible prior restraint in that action, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.127" offset="9771865">The contempt action, this also is really self-censorship, because the person must look at each and everything when he is under an injunction.</text>
