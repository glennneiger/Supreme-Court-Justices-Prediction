            <text syncTime="80.297" offset="424521">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.275" offset="444479">Rule 23 cases somehow tend to evoke emotional and hypothetical arguments from both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.382" offset="488887">I will try to avoid such arguments insofar as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.503" offset="513337">I will try to deal with the realities of this case on its merits because my hope is to persuade this Court to deal with this case in the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.920" offset="563075">Very briefly, two credit card holders sued the bank in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.490" offset="597347">The District Court denied certification in October, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.648" offset="625977">Interlocutory appeal was denied by the Court of Appeals in December, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.285" offset="656488">Over seven months later, the bank tendered to the two plaintiffs all that they demanded and the litigation was concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.265" offset="708420">An appeal was then attempted on behalf of the unnamed and uncertified class and the Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the mootness concept and went further to order certification, hence this petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.943" offset="959195">From 1971 to 1979, not a single, other customer has done any of those things.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="222.620" offset="993886">Of course your friend might argue that the -- they may have refrained from doing so in reliance upon the existence of what they thought was a class action even though it was not certified.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.958" offset="1047176">Well, of course my response to that, Your Honor would be that it was not certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.688" offset="1074134">It was simply filed in the clerk's office and -- and entitled the class action, certification was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.552" offset="1113631">As I said, over seven months went by before the case was finally terminated and no one made any effort to join or intervene or enter the suit in any fashion and that leads me to -- to say that this Court has previously dealt in effect with two situations; one, an appeal for a certified anonymous class despite a mooted plaintiff and where the only identifiable person showing an evident continuing interest in the legal issue was counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.052" offset="1371617">Now, you have previously considered the situation where there was an appeal on behalf of a certified class.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.382" offset="1404949">In addition, the Court has considered the situation where there was an appeal by an intervenor after denial of certification and after a settlement by the named "plaintiffs."</text>
            <text syncTime="339.970" offset="1463254">But today, you'll consider in a situation where named plaintiffs with moot claims ask the appellate court to reverse the trial court's denial of class status with no intervenors.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.815" offset="1622601">I think that sometimes when we write a particular opinion, maybe we -- we can't say it a little bit strong for the particular version that it's being put forth but -- and -- and I'm -- I am familiar with all those cases and that's what I was referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.337" offset="1700760">But today, you're confronted with a situation where the plaintiffs with moot claims are asking the appellate court somehow to engage in legal fiction and let me say this, I -- I think this is the heart of the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.135" offset="1775888">An exercise in the legal fiction is unquestionably required to reverse on appeal and make the reversal, if Your Honors please, retroactive back-past the mootness occurrence until the time that the appellate court says the District Court should've certified the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.354" offset="1868779">Now, that takes an exercise in legal fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.811" offset="1882572">The question before this Court is whether Article III permits engaging in such a legal fiction or perhaps better put, the question before the Court is whether such a legal fiction should be employed in the facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.663" offset="11374007">And then you're making a personal gain by reason of somebody else as being involved that after certification, it would be my view that the duty ought to be on the member of the class to ascertain the intention of the plaintiff as to whether he was going to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.307" offset="11436596">That's clearly recognized that he's got the right to appeal in Coopers &amp; Lybrand running in United Airlines.</text>

            <text syncTime="2857.815" offset="11534608">But the fact if it is, there was a five-day period after we filed our notice of appeal when -- for ought appearing would be intervene or sat back and say, "Our rights are being protected, the case is going forward, we're going to have judgment next into erroneous order, reviewed by the Fifth Circuit and we feel confident that it will be overturned," particularly, in view of the fact that they had already been the same type of case go all the way through the Alabama federal court system through certification and then settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3143.505" offset="12677413">The notice of appeal is a strange thing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.745" offset="12694340">The appeal was not filed for the named plaintiffs but was filed for -- solely on behalf of an anonymous unnamed, uncertified class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.791" offset="12746585">Reference has been made to illegal conduct on the part of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.674" offset="12770095">Now, the record before you shows that the Legislature of the State of Mississippi has not only specifically outlined the charges that can be made for credit card arrangements, such as this but has made that retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.123" offset="12839894">So, you could say to me what are you concerned about, not the merits of the case, if the Court please, but concerned about with no champion and we say no jurisdiction concerned about notices, about a dispute that started in 1971 being sent by a court to 90,000 customers, disturbing our normal, good, respectful business relationship with those customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.283" offset="12976462">That's what the bank is concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.580" offset="12985657">And we submit that in a case of no jurisdiction, that shouldn't take place when here comes a notice from a court which of course a great many of them will not understand, suggesting that they opt in or opt out as the case maybe of litigation of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.845" offset="13058800">Now, counsel says that if certification is significance that this puts the trial judge in -- in a position of -- of power that perhaps he shouldn't assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.657" offset="13134033">I submit that certification does require integrity at the trial level, the question of certification and I submit that so does the entire judicial process require integrity at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.201" offset="13196204">How many cases reach this elevated status?</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.559" offset="13213654">Our system depends upon integrity at the trial level and whether we sometimes like it or not in the abstract, Article III dictates that the trial judge many times rule upon questions that are never reached on appeal.</text>
