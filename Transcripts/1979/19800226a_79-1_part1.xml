            <text syncTime="960.983" offset="3843866">Any question concerning the claim for loss of consortium by the wife of an injured harbor worker has to begin and I submit has to end with the decision of Judge Friendly in the Ignori case decided in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.121" offset="3932473">Judge Friendly recognized that it was a fresh and novel question when he addressed it at that time, at a time when the common law permitted a wife's claim for loss of consortium in only 12 of the states of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.431" offset="4013662">But despite that fact, Judge Friendly did not dismiss her claim for loss of consortium but felt it was necessary to examine the decisional maritime law on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.618" offset="4070400">The decisional maritime law produced only two cases where this particular question had arisen, and in both of those cases involving a claim by a wife of loss of consortium, the claim had been dismissed by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.704" offset="4154723">So Judge Friendly drew upon analogous maritime statutes to arrive at his decision, and the statute he looked at first and foremost was the Jones Act which was an act designed initially to remove an anomaly that existed in the maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.684" offset="4254720">Prior to the passage of the Jones Act, a longshoreman could bring suit for negligence against a ship owner, whereas a seaman could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.949" offset="4295784">In passing the Jones Act, Congress gave the right to the seaman to sue his employer for negligence, but it did so in a limited fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.831" offset="4347298">It restricted the right to the seaman himself by the very language of the act, which states any seaman may bring this cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.967" offset="4399856">As a result, that act has been interpreted and constantly followed by the courts as granting only the right to sue for negligence to the seaman himself and not to his dependents and not to his relatives who might otherwise be entitled to do so were they governed by state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.493" offset="4501943">Judge Friendly also was careful to note that the Jones Act incorporated specifically the terms of the Federal Employers Liability Act which also restricts recovery to the person injured, and this Court so decided in Tonsellito long before the passage of the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.669" offset="4602671">So judicial construction of the Federal Employers Liability Act imposed the same restrictions on the Jones Act permitting only suit against the ship owner by the seaman himself and not by the wife, not by any dependents or relatives and family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.771" offset="4683024">Using the Jones Act as the analogous law in the maritime field, Judge Friendly concluded that there was no right for a wife to sue for loss of consortium in a maritime cause of action, and that scholarly opinion remained the settled harmonious law in the maritime field until this Court's decision in 1974 in the Gaudet case, a wrongful death action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.470" offset="4829832">It is the petitioner's position that the Gaudet case, in a narrow majority opinion, finding a right for loss of consortium in widow should have that particular measure of damages confined to the narrow limitations that Higginbotham later placed upon Gaudet, that is a wrongful death situation within the territorial waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.434" offset="4989701">After the Gaudet decision, there were some courts, lower courts, district and state courts that split just about evenly on this question as to whether Gaudet had actually had any effect on the viability of the Igneri rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.806" offset="5063158">The only federal appellate court to address this question after the Igneri decision, after the Gaudet decision was Christofferson in the Fifth Circuit which found that Igneri was alive and well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.546" offset="5138181">We believe that it is the abiding concern of this Court to administer a uniform body of federal law in the maritime field, and that it is this concern that prompted the Court to decide the Moragne case the way it was decided, to reaffirm uniformity in an area that was a patchwork of strange and anomalous results following the Harrisburg decision which denied the right of wrongful death recovery under the general maritime law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.379" offset="5341414">Gaudet kind of set off in a direction that was without precedent in the maritime filed by for the first time awarding loss of consortium in a wrongful death situation, contrary to the Death on the High Seas Act, contrary to the Federal Employers Liability Act, contrary to the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.029" offset="5444023">And when this measure of damages was first examined by this Court subsequently in the Higginbotham case, Gaudet's holding on loss of consortium for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages was confirmed to the territorial waters in wrongful death actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1381.336" offset="5525316">Frankly, I believe overruling Gaudet would restore harmony and uniformity to this area of law, and that seems to be one of the ways of avoiding the anomaly which otherwise exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.344" offset="5609326">For these reasons, we submit that even if Judge Friendly were to address the Igneri issue today as he did in 1963, despite changing times and changing patterns, women's rights, he would decide the issue exactly the same way today as he decided it in 1963, and he indicated as much in the concluding paragraph of his opinion when he said had the sexes of the parties been reversed, that is, had Peter Igneri, the husband, been suing for loss of consortium of his wife, Theresa, had she been injured aboard the vessel, he would have denied a loss of consortium claim to Peter Igneri even though common law recognized such a right in a husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.086" offset="5844323">So that it is the petitioner's position that there is no discrimination in Judge Friendly's decision with respect to the sexes, that he decided the issue before him in an even-handed way, and that it was his intention to restore parity between longshoremen and seamen in this area of non-pecuniary speculative damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2808.422" offset="11233593">And also in the Lemon case, also cited I believe in both briefs, the opinion of the Chief Judge for the Southern District of Georgia, "I am unable to see the rationality of a rule that if a defendant's negligence causes death, consortium can be recovered by the widow, but where it only results in injury a wife cannot."</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.610" offset="11446439">It was an invitational decision, because in the decision it mentioned the common law by saying at least this much is true, if the common law recognized as wife's claim for loss of consortium, uniformly or nearly so, a United States admiralty court would approach the problem here by asking itself why it should not likewise do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.504" offset="11590008">If the common law denied such a claim, uniformly or nearly so, the inquiry would be whether there was sufficient reason for an admiralty court's nevertheless recognizing one.</text>
