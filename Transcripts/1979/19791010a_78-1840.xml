            <label>Mr. Robert M. Brinson</label>
            <text syncTime="58.147" offset="335914">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.037" offset="351483">I represent the City of Rome and two of its citizens in a Section 5 matter, which is somewhat broader than a Section 5, Voting Rights Act of 1965 matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.496" offset="405400">The City of Rome is a city of some 30,000 persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.430" offset="421073">It lies 65 miles or so northwest of Atlanta, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.914" offset="443016">I am on my 23rd visit to the City of Washington in an effort to get preclearance of my city's growth and government under Section 5, the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act, a provision which we here challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.428" offset="529115">The City of Rome is governed by a Council-Manager form of government, which has been elected at large since 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.444" offset="565164">In 1966, during a time when, or soon after this Court's reapportionment cases, and during those reapportionment cases the City Attorney, upon request from the then governing council, recommended to the City Council that certain changes needed to be made, as he understood the reappointment cases, as they existed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.344" offset="688776">The reason for his recommendation was the City of Rome was divided into nine wards of very disparate size, and even though the City Council was elected at large there was a residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.876" offset="754918">At that time there was a case pending under the title of Dusch v. Davis in the lower court, where that system of government had been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.476" offset="801311">And that ultimately made this Court and it was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.150" offset="815940">But at that time the law was in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.978" offset="835271">The City Attorney recommended that certain provisions of the charter of the City of Rome be changed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.681" offset="874141">Among which were the wards situation, should be changed from nine to three; and, at the same time, some housecleaning matters in the government should be also changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.415" offset="928998">As of that time, in 1964 the Georgia election code required a majority vote; and although that code did not specifically apply to municipalities in Georgia, it did serve as an unofficial guide for local charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.875" offset="1002872">He recommended that majority vote be instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.714" offset="1018232">And noting that there was a tendency from time to time for both the county government and the city government to be swept completely out of office, he recommended, in order to assure some continuity of government, that staggered terms be instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.884" offset="1078941">And the staggered terms, the best way to set them up would be to provide for numbered posts.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.156" offset="1107989">He also, to make consistent the charter with respect to the City Commission and the Board of Education, recommended that residency requirements be instituted for the Board of Education, as they were required for the City Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.435" offset="1173086">So that these electoral changes which were made in 1966 by the Georgia Legislature were the majority vote; numbered posts; staggered terms; and residency requirement for the Board of Education.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>

            <text syncTime="285.784" offset="1246542">With the Commission or Council now still elected at large and still the same number of members, but requirement that they reside, some of them reside in each of the three wards; is that it?</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_m_brinson" startTime="300.857" stopTime="467.064">
            <label>Mr. Robert M. Brinson</label>
            <text syncTime="300.857" offset="1306833">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.638" offset="1317909">These changes took place -- and it is important to note that at the same time these changes took place, on the State front, on the general State law front, the Georgia Municipal Election Code in 1968, which also contained majority vote provision and a numbered post provision, for Statewide application, was submitted to the Attorney General and precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.888" offset="1438908">It is also important to note that when the changes of the City of Rome were made, it was prior to this Court's decision in Allen vs. Board of Elections, and Perkins vs. Matthews.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.005" offset="1487391">And quite a while prior to, in fact five years prior to the time that the Attorney General even had regulations governing the manner in which submissions under Section 5 were to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.779" offset="1550503">The City of Rome in 1974 had an annexation of a rather large -- at least for the City of Rome -- section over its objection; that is, over the City Government's objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.575" offset="1605674">It was imposed upon them by the State Legislature because of a great need of sewer services within this island in the City of Rome.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.438" offset="1645171">It was an island, the City of Rome surrounded an unincorporated area.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.678" offset="1666069">So that the -- over the actual objection of the Rome City Commission, the State of Georgia, the local legislative delegation imposed the annexation of that area on the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.166" offset="1732002">It was a State law by which that annexation took place, although annexation can also take place by ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.269" offset="1764498">In 1974 that annexation was submitted to the Attorney General by the then City Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.937" offset="1799084">The Attorney General wrote back and said that he could not preclear it until he learned about the City Government and what it was like.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.855" offset="1830745">Whereupon, the city provided additional information as to what the city, how the city was structured, and that included the 1966 electoral changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.314" offset="1880586">The Attorney General then refused to preclear both that annexation and the electoral changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.551" offset="1913605">And, in addition, he had inquired about the number of annexations which had occurred since 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.702" offset="1938160">There were a total of 60 annexations, which had taken place during a ten-year period.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="467.064" offset="1971597">And these annexations had been by way of an ordinance or by way of legislation in the State Legislature?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert M. Brinson</label>
            <text syncTime="477.060" offset="2011617">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.364" offset="2020812">So that after the exchange between the City Attorney and the Attorney General of the United States, there remained the unprecleared electoral changes and 13 of the annexations.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.025" offset="2091447">In the meantime, the City of Rome had conducted some five or six elections under the changes which they had made in 1966, including the staggered terms provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.073" offset="2135646">So that there were members right in the middle of their term.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.534" offset="2153514">It was determined, as of the objection time, that no further elections were feasible under the then existing interplay of federal and State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.015" offset="2191444">So that no election has been held in Rome since 1974.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.596" offset="2301785">Whereupon the City of Rome filed suit in the only jurisdiction in which it can file suit, the District Court of the District of Columbia, to seek not only a review of the Attorney General's action or the constitutionality of the Attorney General's action, but bail-out.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.685" offset="2374092">And at which time it also challenged the constitutionality of Section 5, and also asked that it be permitted to bail out under Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.000" offset="2427382">The District Court of the District of Columbia made many findings of fact, to which I commend this Court for its careful reading, which we have itemized in the brief and have shown that there have been some 18 particular findings which are characterized according to the Zimmer standards, under Zimmer vs. McKeithen.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.837" offset="2526751">The City of Rome took the position that in order to carry its burden approving no purpose and no effect, that the Zimmer standards were applicable, at least were a guide by which they could prove the lack of discriminatory effect in the changes and annexations.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.802" offset="2598536">The Court below found that there was not, had not been used in the City of Rome any literacy test for the 17-year period required by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.437" offset="2649109">The Court also found no past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.738" offset="2666350">The Court also found a total access to the political process, and, to quote the Court, it said that the city officials of Rome were quite responsive to the needs of the minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.896" offset="2726954">And, most remarkably, with respect to the political power of minorities in the City of Rome, I quote the specific findings of the Court below Blacks often hold the balance of power in Rome elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.904" offset="2782960">And in Rome politics, the black community, if it chooses to vote as a group, can probably determine the outcome of many, if not most, contests.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.089" offset="2823711">The many others, detailing and generalizing the findings as to the representations provided by the City of Rome for the minorities are set out on pages 5 through 7 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.680" offset="2882121">Quite frankly, I think they are remarkable, and I'm proud of my city for having conducted its own affirmative action plan; that's about what it amounts to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.024" offset="5043493">And that may be true, but I remind the Court in this case that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is an entirely different animal from such remedies as Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="1257.322" offset="5132622">And I would remind the Court also that it has application only to a few States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.897" offset="5150908">Therefore, when Congress passed Section 5, it could not have been considered to uphold the federalism principle because it was applicable to only a few States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.500" offset="5213393">This has been particularly noted, I think, by Mr. Justice Powell, who, in his various dissents with respect to the Voting Rights Act, has noted that it is made more noxious by its applicability to a few States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.743" offset="5290297">The National League of Cities decision -- again, although a decision involving commerce power -- points out that federalism principles prevent Congress from enacting a law that interferes with the State's separate and independent existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1323.850" offset="5398758">It has been a criticism for quite some time, and it was indeed a criticism on theoretical basis in the Katzenbach case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.269" offset="5436479">And we're not asking this Court to rehear the Katzenbach case, we have attempted to make that clear, that Katzenbach is clear -- many times the language of Katzenbach, that the Court was then addressing and that Congress was addressing purposeful discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.715" offset="5510248">The very terms that are used throughout the Katzenbach case refer to the evil of purposeful discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.425" offset="5557060">Moreover, it was also important in South Carolina vs. Katzenbach, and they noted, and based their justification of Section 5 on the temporary nature of the Act; that is, the intent of the Congress at the time was that it would last five years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.138" offset="7879973">And I might point out that that rule was developed by this Court in the context of a question about the effect of the changes that were involved in Beer, the question of discriminatory purpose had not been reached by the District Court in Beer, and therefore was not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.337" offset="7968684">It was something to be considered on remand in Beer, after this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.821" offset="7990627">So the rule of retrogression was adopted by this Court in Beer, entirely in the context of the effect test under Section 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.827" offset="8034722">That was the rule applied quite properly here, in our view, by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.649" offset="8057919">The kinds of changes at issue here, particularly annexations of predominantly white areas, and the imposition of majority vote requirements where previously there had been election by plurality, and the run-off elections that went along with that, and the imposition of staggered terms were all devices specifically mentioned in the Committee Report accompanying the 1975 extension of the Voting Rights Act, as devices threatening diminution of black voting strength.</text>

            <text syncTime="2125.258" offset="8604400">And in just a moment X would like to speak further about the annexations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.491" offset="8621328">I just wanted to say with respect to the other changes, as we pointed out in our brief; unlike the typical section 5 case, in this case the District Court did not have to predict whether there would be a retrogressive effect as a result of the other changes because elections had taken place for eight years under those changes, without their having been precleared, and in the 1970 election, in which Reverend Hill, a black candidate to whom counsel for the petitioner referred, ran for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.863" offset="8782869">He would have been elected under the old procedure, indeed, arguably, he was elected since the run-off election and the majority vote requirement had not been precleared and were a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.191" offset="8828113">But there has been a subsequent election, so that issue is, for practical purposes, moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.516" offset="8849429">But, arguably, he was elected because he received a plurality in the initial vote, and then was defeated in the run-off, in which a majority vote was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.989" offset="8891329">required as a result of the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.615" offset="8901883">So there was no speculation required about whether a retrogressive effect was involved in the changes at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.601" offset="8941798">Now, with respect to the annexations, this case, in our submission, differs only in degree and not in any way in principle from the Petersburg case, which was decided summarily by this Court in Volume 410 U.S., and was referred to extensively in the Court's subsequent opinion in City of Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.580" offset="9053706">In affirming that judgment, this Court necessarily rejected petitioner's basic statutory argument here, and implicitly rejected his constitutional argument as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.414" offset="9117027">And for the convenience of the Court, in order to clarify this, I have asked the Clerk to circulate a Xerox copy of the motion to affirm that was filed by the United States in City of Petersburg, and that was granted by seven Justices of this Court, all of whom are present here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2324.579" offset="9401657">And with the Court's leave, I'd like to just read a short passage here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.189" offset="9424123">Appellant argues that because the court below found nothing in the annexation which indicated that it had a racial purpose, judicial inquiry in a suit of this nature, into the effect on the Negro voter of an extension of the city limits into white suburbia is foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.537" offset="9485563">The plain language of Section 5, however, refutes this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.103" offset="9503744">And there we quote that the burden is to show that the change does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.005" offset="9551391">Then we say, the District Court therefore properly did not end its inquiry upon finding that the Petersburg annexation was quote, "a necessary measure to allow the city to expand its tax base and its potential for growth and development."</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.601" offset="9609801">It looked further to ascertain whether, as this Court stated in a related context, designedly or otherwise, the extension of the city limits under the circumstances of this particular case would operate to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial elements of the voting population.</text>

            <text syncTime="2427.723" offset="9814288">As a matter of fact, to a large extent, the reasoning of the District Court was subsequently endorsed in the City of Richmond's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.894" offset="9850964">The reason why this decision happens to be more closely on point is because here the District Court denied preclearance to the annexation, whereas, after appropriate adjustments were made in voting procedures, this Court upheld the annexation, and the City of Richmond applying what to all appearances are precisely the same standards on which this denial is based and was affirmed by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2487.259" offset="10052420">There was a different finding here, which arguably, could make a difference either in the relief that would be appropriate or in the finding of whether there was a retrogressive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.988" offset="10115323">But it doesn't make any difference in the basic statutory constitutional question, whether, having found nondiscriminatory purpose, indeed a purpose that is referred to in one quotation we have from the opinion, in a footnote on page 11, there's a compelling need for the annexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.921" offset="10207065">The District Court nevertheless was correct in striking it down, because the city did not meet the burden of showing that it nonetheless did not have an effect, in the absence of ameliorative changes in other voting procedures, in effect proscribed by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.741" offset="10278327">It seems to me that is the basic statutory and constitutional contention that is being made on the other side of this case, which would require the rejection of this affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.830" offset="10330676">And I would just point out that again on pages 10 and 11 we laid bare that that was what was at issue in City of Petersburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.773" offset="10374457">Here the diminution in the black voting strength resulting from the annexation, although measurable, was obviously less in degree, which is why I say the case differs in degree but not in principle from the City of Richmond case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.740" offset="10442376">And the District Court took proper account of this difference in degree in devising the remedy, or, that is, in stating what remedy would be appropriate in order for preclearance to be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.995" offset="10515310">The pertinent portion of the District Court's opinion begins at page 54b in the Appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement, and there the District Court looks very properly to the standards spelled out by this Court in the City of Richmond case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.033" offset="10595453">There was a two-step analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.780" offset="10610500">The first was that the Court found the impact, because we find the impact on black voting strength to be significant, a measurable retrogressive impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.906" offset="10658983">And we have spelled out the magnitude in that lengthy footnote in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.254" offset="10676433">We must inquire further, we must proceed to the second step, whether the black community, after the annexation, has a fair opportunity to obtain representation reasonably commensurate with its post-annexation numerical strength, which is a paraphrase of the standard adopted by this Court in City of Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.098" offset="10755741">And while in both City of Richmond and Petersburg, a change to single-member districting was required under the facts of those cases, in order to ameliorate the retrogressive effect that the annexations would have, here because the effect was less extreme the Court refused to say that that was the only possible way of ameliorating those adverse effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.460" offset="10873187">And, as we pointed out in our brief, there are several alternatives that are open to the city to ameliorate those effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.115" offset="10919790">The other changes in voting procedures, particularly the change to majority voting requirement having been eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.133" offset="10947897">As a matter of fact, the Attorney General no longer interposes an objection with respect to the Board of Education elections, no longer interposes an objection to the annexations for that purpose, but only because ameliorative changes of one kind or another should be made with respect to the City Commissioner election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.097" offset="11063777">And we have spelled out on pages 40 to 42 of our brief the three possibilities that are open to the city to provide an appropriate amelioration under the standards of City of Richmond.</text>

            <text syncTime="2762.200" offset="11152175">Well, the difference is because of a residency requirement for City Commission elections, which did not exist under the old procedure for the Board of Education election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.825" offset="11206719">The residency requirement, in the context here, was we have explained in some detail on page 41, serves the function of a numbered post requirement, and results in head-to-head contests that, in effect, results in majority vote requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.828" offset="11290728">As a practical matter, that's been the effect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.220" offset="11304208">And the residency requirement could either be dropped or adjusted to a requirement based on the three wards that were later adopted rather than the nine wards, as we suggest; so as to ameliorate the adverse effect of adding this large number of additional white voters we have on the pre-existing numerical opportunity that black voters had to elect a candidate of their choice, which was demonstrated in the 1970 election, when Reverend Hill did win a plurality on the first vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.873" offset="11486856">Now, the statutory standard, as we say, was, in our view, settled in Petersburg and Richmond, and certainly is described similarly in Beer and in other decisions, and has been endorsed by Congress in the Committee Reports with respect to the re-enactments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.074" offset="11587688">And the constitutional power of Congress to adopt those statutory standards was implicitly upheld in all of those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.242" offset="11636381">Starting with South Carolina v. Katzenbach itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.416" offset="11665011">There really have been four decisions under the Voting Rights Act which show that Congress is not restrictive in adopting legislative measures to taking action against only what could be proven to be violations of Section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.573" offset="11765635">South Carolina v. Katzenbach is itself such a decision, and has in common with two others, Gaston and Oregon v. Mitchell, the fact that the Court upheld a congressional ban on the use of literacy tests, in Oregon v. mitchell a wider ban; in Gaston County an application of the ban to particular circumstances -- upheld that ban despite the fact that this Court had held in Lassiter v. North Carolina that the use of literacy test was not a violation of Section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment, or at least had not been proven to be a violation of Section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment, such that the Court could strike it down.</text>

Mitchell, and I would like to quote this opinion, which was joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Blackmun, and this is on page 284 of 400 U.S."Because of the justification for extending the ban on literacy test to the entire nation, "-- the claim here was being made by Arizona, that the ban on literacy test should not be extended to it -- "need not, because of the justification for extending the ban on literacy test to the entire nation, need not turn on whether literacy tests unfairly discriminate against Negroes in every State in the Union; congress was not required to make State-by-State findings concerning either the equality of educational opportunity or actual impact of literacy requirements on the Negro citizens' access to the ballot box.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.473" offset="12297279">In the interest of uniformity, Congress may paint with a much broader brush than may this Court, which must confine itself to the judicial function of deciding individual cases and controversies upon individual records, compare Lassiter v. Northampton Election Board."</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.388" offset="12372929">The findings that Congress made when it enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 would have supported a nationwide ban on literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.293" offset="12416502">Instead, at that time, Congress chose to limit its attention to the geographic areas where immediate action seemed necessary, quoting South Carolina v. Katzenbach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.454" offset="12457148">Experience gained under the 1965 Act has now led Congress to conclude that it should go the whole distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.801" offset="12486614">This approach to the problem is a rational one, consequently, it is within the constitutional power of Congress, under Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.152" offset="12527992">And the eight Justices who reached this question under the Fifteenth Amendment -- Mr. Justice Douglas upheld it under the Fourteenth Amendment -- the eight essentially agreed on this point, the disagreements were on other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.309" offset="12592567">Mr. Justice Black's opinion, Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion, and the joint opinion of Justices Brennan, White and Marshall were not in disagreement on this basic point about legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.504" offset="12653380">That there need be a rational nexus to the kind of discrimination that would be a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, but, as Mr. Justice Stewart said, that Congress can paint with a much broader brush.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.508" offset="12709386">And as we show in our brief, there are really two ways in which this legislation has a rational nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.856" offset="12742823">One is the fact that it applies in areas where there is reason to presume that in many, perhaps most, of the areas to which it applies, there has been purposeful voting discrimination, the effect of which can be perpetuated by changes without this prophylactic device of preclearance provided for in Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.481" offset="12853269">And the other is that in light of the findings of racial bloc voting that were made by the District Court in this case, changes can lend themselves to the facilitation and promotion of private purposeful discrimination, and therefore are connected with the principle of Terry v. Adams and other decisions of this Court under Section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.450" offset="12961207">So there are two ways in which there is a wholly adequate legislative nexus here, a rational nexus with purposeful discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.105" offset="13007809">And the case therefore falls well within the principles this Court has previously settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.616" offset="13053785">On the remaining point, we'll rely principally on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.440" offset="13085132">It is clear in our view that the change at issue here were not precleared in 1968 at the time of the Attorney General preclearing the State law which didn't make any specific reference to Rome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.264" offset="13156394">As this Court pointed out in the Sheffield case, which we think is controlling on this point, it bears re-emphasizing at the outset that the purpose of Section 5 is to establish procedures in which voting changes can be scrutinized by a federal instrumentality before they become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.618" offset="13233821">And unless the Attorney General's attention is called to them, the purpose of the Act will not be served; there will be no scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.084" offset="13263705">There was no scrutiny of what changes would occur in the City of Rome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.376" offset="13292857">And, for reasons expressed in our brief, we believe the Attorney General properly interpreted his regulations with respect to the request for reconsideration that had been submitted to him, and acted in a timely manner under those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.487" offset="13361298">And even if he had not, he nonetheless had interposed an objection within the time specified by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.209" offset="13396198">And we don't see why the protections of the statute would be abrogated by tardiness under the regulations in consideration of the request for reconsideration.</text>
