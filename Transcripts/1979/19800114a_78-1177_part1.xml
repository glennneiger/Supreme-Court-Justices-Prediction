            <text syncTime="61.295" offset="348557">This case deals with the permissibility of certain State taxation concerning use of tribal and Bureau of Indian Affairs roads on the reservation when use is made by a non-Indian logger as a part of a tribal forestry enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.680" offset="422118">The White Mountain Apache Tribe and its logger Pinetop Logging Company, actually one of its loggers, submits that the State taxes are barred by two separate principles of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.961" offset="475199">The first ground for a claim of defense to these taxes is that they are preempted by comprehensive Federal regulation of the fields of managing and harvesting Indian reservation timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.632" offset="529951">Our second defense is the doctrine that State laws may not be applied even to non-Indians with respect to their dealings with Indians on the reservation where to do so would infringe on the tribal self-government.</text>

            <label>Mr. Neil Vincent Wake</label>
            <text syncTime="140.745" offset="666311">My co-counsel Mr. Michael Brown will address himself to the claim of infringement of tribal self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.707" offset="714167">The facts upon which this case arised can be stated summarily as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.392" offset="732975">Over a hundred years ago President Grant set aside a reservation for the White Mountain Apaches in a remote and mountainous part of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.965" offset="767248">Virtually the only significant resource on that reservation is the timber that grows in the mountains.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.928" offset="791071">Fortunately for this tribe, that resource holds out the potential for a perpetually renewable resource if wisely managed.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.866" offset="826807">And, indeed, the tribal timber enterprise is the principal financial support for the entire tribal government in all other tribal programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.370" offset="868812">In addition, the tribal timber enterprise is a major on-reservation employer of members of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.111" offset="899845">Obviously an essential part of the program of harvesting this timber is getting the trees from off the mountain down to the tribal mill in White River, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.455" offset="945194">That process requires the building and the maintenance of an extensive road system throughout the reservation and, indeed, there are literally thousands of miles of roads throughout this reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.399" offset="996916">Most of these roads, almost all of these roads are built and maintained by the tribe itself either directly or through its loggers.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.655" offset="1041951">I have brought with me and intend to submit to the Clerk's Office for illustrative purposes only, the most recent U.S. Geological Survey map of the reservation which gives some indication of the extent of the road system that is to be found thereon.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="251.505" stopTime="256.220">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="251.505" offset="1109347">But do they use the State road to some degree?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neil_vincent_wake" startTime="256.220" stopTime="302.705">
            <label>Mr. Neil Vincent Wake</label>
            <text syncTime="256.220" offset="1128260">Your Honor, the loggers have occasion to cross the State roads and to use them from time to time and, indeed, the Pinetop Logging Company keeps precise records of all of its use of State roads and it pays taxes with respect to those uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.340" offset="1196701">This lawsuit does not involve an attempt by the State of Arizona to obtain tax payments with respect to the use of its own roads that it owns or builds or maintains or polices.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.709" offset="1242258">Rather, this lawsuit has to do with intent by the State of Arizona to derive windfall profits for the benefit of its State road system, not from the use of those roads but from the use of wholly different roads which are built and maintained and owned solely by the tribe and by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="302.705" offset="1314147">Well, you don't contend, do you, as a matter of general tax apportionment law that a State could not exact a license fee for the use of a vehicle and devote the proceeds of that tax to maintenance of roads and base it on the value of the vehicle; and that the owner of a vehicle could nonetheless say, well, I only drive my car to church on Sunday, so although your tax would come out to be computed $100 I am paying you $3, which I think is the value that I use your road.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neil_vincent_wake" startTime="341.051" stopTime="376.755">
            <label>Mr. Neil Vincent Wake</label>
            <text syncTime="341.051" offset="1467538">Your Honor, we certainly do not make that contention and the principles to which you refer are general principles of municipal and public law with respect to taxing authorities of various taxing entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.137" offset="1515917">What we are discussing in this case is a different body of law which is a body of Federal law which has to do with when a specific congressional regulatory scheme dealing with specific subject matters preempts interfering State laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.081" offset="1587702">So the answer to your question is "No," but I submit that does not answer the question before the Court.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="376.755" offset="1610376">Well, then why does Pinetop keep specific records of its use on Arizona State highways?</text>

            <label>Mr. Neil Vincent Wake</label>
            <text syncTime="384.822" offset="1642663">Your Honor, the reason for that is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.661" offset="1649977">First, our client as a practical matter thought it fair to pay those taxes, and as a practical matter we choose not to bring that lawsuit.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="397.260" offset="1692400">So, in effect, you say that you might be able to challenge those laws but you are electing to pay a part of the tax that is levied.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.114" offset="1743809">Your Honor, we do not choose to challenge the State's collection of taxes with respect to the use of its own roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.723" offset="1766275">We do not admit liability, we simply have no case or controversy before the Court with respect to that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.868" offset="1838895">I believe that those license fees are paid and I would point out that they are de minimis in amount so far as my understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.426" offset="1869093">That again is another lawsuit not --</text>

            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="445.109" offset="1883826">Mr. Wake, can I ask you another question.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.810" offset="1898663">With respect to the 8-cent-per-gallon fuel tax, the statute says "For the purpose of partially compensating the State for the use of its highways," and so forth, the 8-cent tax is imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.655" offset="1937951">Supposing the statute said in order to generate general revenues for the State, the tax in this amount is imposed and went into the general funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.808" offset="1974627">Would your case be the same?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neil_vincent_wake" startTime="469.882" stopTime="549.610">
            <label>Mr. Neil Vincent Wake</label>
            <text syncTime="469.882" offset="1982882">Your Honor, that would be a slightly different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.075" offset="1991659">I submit that the answer would probably be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.166" offset="2012035">And let me elaborate on that answer for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.087" offset="2027708">Again, the fundamental concern which we submit the Court must address itself to is what the subject matter and the purposes of the Federal regulation is and whether those purposes require the exclusion of these State taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.382" offset="2088939">Now, in this case the Federal Government has regulated the entire field, we submit, of managing and harvesting Indian timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.762" offset="2122376">These particular State taxes are offensive not because of what they are used for but because of how they bear upon the Federal scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.004" offset="2159365">We submit that the fact that these State taxes are used for the building of unrelated State roads is part of what makes these taxes worse, it is not necessarily what makes them bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.674" offset="2210043">What makes them bad is the fact that the attempt of the State of Arizona to derive tax revenues out of the tribal forestry program runs at cross purposes to the specifically identified and articulated Federal purposes of the management and harvesting of tribal timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.500" offset="2277334">Therefore, whether the State uses these taxes for other purposes or not, is not necessarily controlling.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="549.610" offset="2301785">How is that different from charging a tax say -- sales taxes or something like that on the purchase of the vehicles which are used exclusively in the logging business?</text>

            <text syncTime="559.440" offset="2341177">Your Honor, I would submit that in order to draw the boundaries of the reach of the preemptive force which we submit must be recognized here, one would have to look to a number of considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.754" offset="2394363">And there is no bright line test but there are a number of overlapping considerations that are adequate for purposes of identifying the specific needs to protect against specific State instructions into the regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.491" offset="2449324">I may list a few of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.081" offset="2455698">One is the nexus of the State assertion of jurisdiction with the direct subject matter of the Federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.092" offset="2487777">Here Federal regulation deals specifically and directly with the process of getting the trees off the mountain down to the mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.370" offset="2528841">That is the core of the entire statutory and regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.660" offset="2542007">And these taxes are an attempt to derive revenues off of that very subject matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="745.108" offset="3083786">The taxation which the State seeks to reimpose in this case is an infringement upon the sovereignty of the White Mountain Apache Tribe and its right of tribal self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.063" offset="3127672">It interferes with a fundamental purpose, as well as the basic nature of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.841" offset="3154735">One of the most basic principles of Indian law is that those powers vested in an Indian tribe are not delegated but are rather inherent powers of limited sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.329" offset="3204681">They are inherent in that that sovereignty preexisted both the sovereignty of the State of Arizona as well as United States of America itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.026" offset="3239476">Williams v. Lee has said that the test of sovereignty when you are dealing with the affairs of non-Indians on reservations is that the tribe and the State law, that each have legitimate interests but that the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them shall remain inviolate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael J. Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="815.326" offset="3364655">Yes, sir, Congress has the power of defeasance to take away the sovereignty which the Indian tribes retain, but it has not yet done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.519" offset="3409481">And the indications from Congress of course are quite to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.703" offset="3430170">The Congress has given, for example, in 1953 five States the right to extend both their civil and criminal jurisdiction to Indian reservations, and to allow those States to accept the benefits of that as well as the responsibilities for the tribes in Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.100" offset="3515747">Arizona, while not one of the five delegated States, had the right and the power by several means to ascribe to Public Law 280 and accept the responsibilities for the White Mountain Apache Tribe and the other tribes with reservations within the State of Arizona and refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.144" offset="3611982">This lawsuit is essentially about roads and trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.470" offset="3645210">The State would like to say that it is about taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.154" offset="3659943">But it is about the fact that the White Mountain Apache Tribe's reservation, which is the Fort Apache Reservation, -- it is in northeastern Arizona and it is 1,600,000 acres, it is rural and it is mountainous and it is widespread and with people all over that reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.255" offset="3732355">It is not an urban area and the major rural or urban area is White River and it has maybe 1,000 to 1,500 people living in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.211" offset="3776240">One of the designed secondary purposes of the tribal timber industry is the creation of roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.951" offset="3827127">The timber industry must in fact create roads to get to the trees so that they can be logged, the forests can be logged.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.061" offset="3855653">But also it is necessary to create adequate roads into those rural and remote areas so that we can have the ability to deliver food and essential services to remote areas of the reservation and to maintain communications with those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.215" offset="3924198">And that is a direct and design product of the roadbuilding and the maintenance program of the tribe and the Fort Apache Timber Company and the loggers who are agents to create a good number of the roads and by contract of course maintain the roads pursuant to the Bureau of Indian Affairs criteria and regulations of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.544" offset="4033599">In Moe this Court said that States in dealing with actions on reservations involving Indians and non-Indians that the State would be allowed to tax those kinds of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.805" offset="4098591">If there was a significant interest that the State had in some real economic benefit was going not to the Indian party involved in the transaction but to a non-Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.474" offset="4153240">And that essentially what was happening was that this transaction, or attempt to cloak this transaction in immunity was merely an end run by the non-Indian around legitimate taxing interests of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.866" offset="4202872">We would submit to the Court that that is a valid test and that there ought to be some way that this Court can draw a line quite apart from the preemption argument made in Warren Trading Post along the infringement of tribal sovereignty and the infringement of tribal self-government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.362" offset="4376848">We believe that the tax infringement test ought to consider at least four things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.983" offset="4403284">Number one, the location.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.140" offset="4411956">Obviously the Indian reservation itself is historically the locus where Federal Indian policy is effectuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.352" offset="4448737">Historically all of this, and actually in this litigation all of the activities involved take place within the confines of the Fort Apache Reservation on the White Mountain Apache's land held in trust for them by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.419" offset="4512998">Another issue is Does it interfere with the fundamental purpose or nature of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.327" offset="4528671">And it is inconceivable to me that with the geographical make-up of the reservation that Congress and the President in making up the reservation could not have anticipated that a tribal timber industry was going to be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.322" offset="4600665">Number three, where does the burden truly fall, on the Indian or the non-Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.725" offset="4618324">Clearly it doesn't make any difference what you call a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.968" offset="4635251">You can call it a sales tax, a privilege tax, an excise tax, a motor carrier tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.209" offset="4656253">The question is where does the burden fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.014" offset="4671404">That is just what the State wants to do with the taxing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.977" offset="4691257">In this case it is admitted that the economic -- the total economic burden and direct economic burden falls on the tribe and the tribal timber industry in that dollar for dollar the tribe must pay to planter all the money the money they expend for the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.486" offset="4765341">In this case, another issue and thing that I think that the Court ought to look at in formulating a test is the legitimate interests of the State in the tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.199" offset="6916159">In other words, as we conceive the Federal scheme here it is not just a scheme for cutting down timber and supervising roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.734" offset="6942281">It is a scheme for making these tribal timber enterprises a basis for making the tribe self-sufficient within their reservation for their members within their reservation and make it a going concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.693" offset="7154186">I am not sure as to what extent that would be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.803" offset="7170591">The Arizona taxes at issue here would fall upon all of the logging contractors, not just Pinetop; and can reasonably be assumed as a practical matter to be passed on to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.361" offset="7208835">I don't think that is really contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.139" offset="7215940">The State argues instead that legal incidence is what makes a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.240" offset="7232345">The record does not show what all of those taxes have amounted to in any given year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.102" offset="7247809">But the important point is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.866" offset="7254810">The tax rate is determined by the State quite independently of what the tribe's balance sheet might show in any given year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.481" offset="7281246">It is just an uncontrollable financial burden that could be quite substantial and is inconsistent with what we think is the thrust of the Federal scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.333" offset="7316668">Second, the taxes infringe on tribal sovereignty and they do so in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.566" offset="7333595">As we have argued, they interfere with scheme that Congress has devised to foster and assure a viable tribal self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.564" offset="7365674">And they also represent an intrusion into the geographical territory of the tribe without the warrant of any strong State interest other than the desire to augment its general revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.157" offset="7404022">Now, the argument here is almost somewhat metaphysical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.772" offset="7418441">I think that is something of what makes Indian law a little difficult and complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.651" offset="7441951">It is a notion of what it means for a sovereign or a quasi-sovereign to have authority over its territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.266" offset="7468387">And although the tribes clearly do not have absolute authority of their territory, cannot block the State at the boundaries of the reservation, nevertheless it says something in derogation, in serious derogation of its powers over its territory for the State to come onto the reservation and tax some activity with no interest, no legitimate interest, no regulatory interest other than just a desire for more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.001" offset="7575385">It is just a treatment of the boundaries as if they can be casually passed over without any seriousness to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1986.053" offset="8047574">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.916" offset="8059068">At the outset I think what I would like to do is address a couple of questions that were raised by the Court during Mr. Wake's opening remarks, Mr. Brown's opening remarks and the United States' remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.749" offset="8110373">Specifically, it is my recollection that Justice Stevens was inquiring as to the question of whether or not we were talking about the same principles, were we talking about a general gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.037" offset="8163558">What about Weyerhauesur or some other company operating on the reservation, would they be subject to a gross receipts tax if in fact we weren't talking about either the use fuel tax or the motor carrier tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.786" offset="8222490">The answer to that question is "Yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.605" offset="8233775">In Footnote 13 of the petitioner's opening brief we find a discussion of Arizona Revised Statutes Section 42-1309 and 1312.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.449" offset="8285184">Now, those were the statutes that were under consideration by this Court in Warren Trading Post.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.998" offset="8311411">An examination of the transaction privilege tax code will reveal in ARS Section 42-1321 an exemption for the transportation of tangible personal property from Point A to Point B within the State of Arizona if the outfit being purportedly otherwise subject to the transaction privilege tax pays a tax under 40-641.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.553" offset="8425618">The point is under 40-641 they are subjected to the motor carrier tax which has a relationship to State roads at a rate of 2-1/2 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.862" offset="8470862">Under section 42-1310, which is under the transaction privilege tax code, they would otherwise be subject to the transaction privilege tax with respect to hauling within the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.970" offset="8519241">They are exempted by virtue of State law under section 42-1321.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.932" offset="8539094">So the answer to Mr. Justice Stevens' question is yes, a transaction privilege tax would apply to that transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.544" offset="8573576">Again, that is not the case that we have here this morning but if that case were to come up, then the question becomes would it be permissible as a matter of Indian law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.072" offset="8619656">Again, it would remain the State of Arizona's position, yes, we are dealing with a non-Indian entity on an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.662" offset="8650062">Any economic burden of either the Arizona transaction privilege tax, the motor carrier tax or the use fuel tax which may be visited upon the Indian reservation arises solely by virtue of contractual negotiation, nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.449" offset="8721220">There is absolutely no requirement of the State law under any of those three taxes that these costs be passed on or that the legal incidents be shifted over.</text>

            <text syncTime="2289.227" offset="9260283">With respect to the travel on those State highways, they have paid the taxes without protest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2370.971" offset="9587231">But so long as the road remained a private thoroughfare they would not be so traveled and use of those road would not be subject to the State tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.675" offset="9638118">With respect to the argument that this entire area has been preempted, it is the State of Arizona's position that quite the contrary, the Federal regulatory scheme speaks in terms of sound management of the forest resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.427" offset="9729128">The Federal objective is to protect the forest resource, to protect it from disease, fire, various other plagues and famines that might occur that would destroy or harm the forest resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.162" offset="9788061">The State of Arizona respectfully submits that that preempts Area A, and we are talking about Area B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.492" offset="9817318">There is nothing in either the Federal statutes or the Code of Federal Regulations upon which Pinetop and the tribe rely to indicate a congressional intent or, indeed, an intent on behalf of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to preempt costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.649" offset="9894013">Indeed, the Code of Federal regulations specifically provides with respect to the Bureau of Indian Affairs that administrative costs up to the extent of some 10 percent of the gross receipts of the tribal enterprise might be subjected to a charge to cover these administrative expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.348" offset="9968724">So the congressional objective, while it may be to protect the forest resource, there is nothing in the regulations as was present in Warren Trading Post with respect to the prices that a trader could charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.317" offset="10024626">There is nothing in these regulations to suggest that the cost that Pinetop incurs in pursuing its activities on the reservation are similarly preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.169" offset="10076035">We are talking about two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.649" offset="10085961">Mr. Brown mentioned that Public Law 280 was passed for purposes of permitting States to assume criminal jurisdiction and civil jurisdiction over civil positive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.059" offset="10139564">Well, in fact this Court's decision in Bryan v. Itasca County establishes that that grant of authority by Congress does not extend to States if they desire to impose the direct legal obligation of State taxes upon reservation Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.282" offset="10208528">Quite the contrary, Public Law 280 was construed by this Court to extend to civil causes of action, tort cases, contract cases, access to the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.834" offset="10262758">So if the suggestion be that had Arizona adopted Public Law 280 this would be a different case, Arizona would submit it is just not so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.989" offset="10467349">The Arizona Court of Appeals opinion, which is before this Court, does not differentiate between BIA roads and tribal roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.174" offset="10508100">The fact is however that the assessment that was made by the Arizona taxing authorities related only to the taxes attributable to Pinetop's operation upon BIA roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.359" offset="10576854">Use on tribal roads was extracted, that was not subjected to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.518" offset="10601409">Now, it is true, I must confess, that that position was not specifically or clearly advocated in the appellate briefs, nor does the Court of Appeals opinion make that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.070" offset="10655640">However, the fact of the matter is that under current State law, under the legislative scheme that exists in Arizona right now, Arizona has no intention of going forward on some purported theory that because the Court of Appeals decision says we can, that we can go ahead and tax use on these tribal roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.782" offset="10730454">I have been assured of that by my client by telephone last night.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.390" offset="10744978">And other than that we would put that before the Court to apprise the court of what the true facts are.</text>

            <text syncTime="2897.776" offset="11694477">And therefore Mr. Macpherson's argument that the magnitude of these taxes is of some relevance goes out the window because the footnote that we have in our brief based upon the record attempts to establish a percentage of what the true economic burden is with respect to a particular time period.</text>
