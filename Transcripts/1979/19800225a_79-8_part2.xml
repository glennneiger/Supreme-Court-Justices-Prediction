            <text syncTime="17.169" offset="172074">The Court of Appeals concluded and the respondent agrees that the due process clause requires either that the district judge defer to the magistrate's proposed findings of fact or to rehear the testimony, but this analysis doesn't make any sense in the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.483" offset="241351">Here the District Court adopted the magistrate's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.501" offset="257337">If the District Court had merely deferred to the magistrate's findings, it would have again denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.438" offset="281161">That it made a more thorough review and did not defer could not possibly have deprived the respondent of any kind of procedural protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.964" offset="311254">In fact, he received more protection because he got a more thorough review.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.729" offset="330271">We also believe that the Court of Appeals analysis is flawed in failing to consider the three facts that this Court has set forth which should be considered in determining what process is due in a particular circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.096" offset="375724">That is the personal interest involved, the risk of erroneous deprivation of that interest, and the government's administrative and financial interests in adhering to the procedure set forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.372" offset="680835">Those findings have ample support in the record and the District Court, upon making a thorough review of that record, the magistrate's report and the submissions of the parties concluded that the motion should be denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.534" offset="945507">Is it not one thing to affirm credibility findings on a cold record and quite another to reverse them on a cold record?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="221.255" offset="988348">Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is why we say in our brief that the District Court could reverse the magistrate's proposed findings in a case like this one, for example, where there are objective factors in the record to support the magistrate, what the magistrate actually concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.785" offset="1054490">But let's assume that the magistrate concluded that he believed respondent, well, there are various objective factors in this record which make respondent's testimony fairly incredible at points, from which upon reading from the cold record you can tell that the respondent -- he admitted that he lied on November 19th, his August 8th -- he claims he made no statement on August 8th, yet that statement that is attributed to him by the Chicago police and appears in the arrest report is the same statement that he admits having made on January 12th.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.209" offset="1176221">And it is just inherently incredible that the Chicago police made up a statement which respondent admits that he subsequently made in January following his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.970" offset="1215300">So in this kind of a case, where there are objective factors aside from the just a pure swearing contest, the District Court in making its de novo determination could reverse the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.762" offset="1258454">Obviously, the District Court is on shaky ground in those circumstances where it is purely a swearing contest and he simply reverses the magistrate, and that is a much more --</text>

            <text syncTime="319.501" offset="1381334">That's correct, but due process may come into play at some point where it is purely a swearing contest and the District Court reverses the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.348" offset="1424802">Of course, as I said before, that did not happen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.796" offset="1434520">The magistrate evaluated the respondent's testimony and he found it not to be credible and the District Court adopted those findings.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="339.276" offset="1460433">Let me test that out with this hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.440" offset="1469106">Suppose the magistrate made careful and detailed findings that he believed the defendant and disbelieved the officers and therefore recommended the suppression of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.540" offset="1529501">Now, the District Judge reading the record and nothing more reverses the district judge on the credibility finding, do you mean that would give rise to due process questions?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="367.302" offset="1572551">Yes, although that would be similar to what happens in agency proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.768" offset="1586448">The same kind of relationship that exists between the magistrate and the District Court exists in agency proceedings, in the British special master situation, in special masters in original cases in this Court, and normally the reviewing court or the court that has the power to enter the judgment does not simply toss aside the magistrate's findings, and it normally would give them credit for what are worth based on his independent review of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.992" offset="1691355">And when the reviewing court reviews, let's say, the SEC's determination of something, it may be that the ALJ concluded adversely to the agency's finding of fact, and that is something again under Universal Camera Corp., this Court's decision in Universal Camera Corp., that the reviewing court can take into account as to whether there is substantial evidence in the record or whether the District Court's determination is erroneous.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="420.334" offset="1784665">But don't you take into account the difference between findings of fact generally and findings of fact based entirely on credibility of the speaker?</text>

            <text syncTime="433.309" offset="1836596">And where, of course, the only issue is credibility, the District Court, if you wanted to reverse the magistrate and the only issue was credibility and the evidence was equipoised between the defendant and the police officer, then the District Court cannot simply ignore the magistrate's determination of credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.618" offset="1905873">If you wish to reverse the magistrate in that circumstance, he would probably have to rehear the testimony or recommit it back to the magistrate for further findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="681.250" offset="2828413">As the government stated this morning, the Magistrates Act not only withholds from the magistrate decision-making power with respect to case dispositive motions, but it expressly provides that if any party objects to any finding or any recommendation of the magistrate "a judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings to which objection is made."</text>

            <text syncTime="728.687" offset="3018167">I think that the question is whether the district judge is in a position to make an independent determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.111" offset="3039796">If all the district judge does is looks at what the magistrate has done and says, well, this is a credibility finding, I obviously don't have the evidence before me to reevaluate that, I don't see how that can possibly be explained as any kind of a de novo determination of anything, and I think that is the difference between what the Court of Appeals felt and the position that the government is urging now.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.923" offset="3167065">First of all, let me just point out that this act does not use the word hearing the way the government suggests, that is an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.344" offset="3196740">This act speaks of hearing motions for summary judgment and motions to dismiss complaints and all kinds of things that are not evidentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.462" offset="3229236">And this Court, in the case of United States v. First City National Bank, had virtually an identical argument before it, where a party claimed that because a statute spoke of de novo review rather than trial de novo that there was to be more limited judicial review, and the Court rejected that.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.672" offset="3290049">It said that the critical concept is de novo and what de novo means is that there has to be an independent determination of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.649" offset="3325994">And I would just suggest that in many decisions of this Court, virtually all the decisions of this Court talk about de novo, all of these terms are used interchangeably.</text>

            <text syncTime="870.022" offset="3583457">And I think that the suggestion that the statute is rendered useless because in cases where credibility was critical or some other source of evidence that wasn't included in the record required rehearing, I don't think that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.435" offset="3637164">I would expect that there area great many matters where if there is an initial hearing before a judicial magistrate, there can be a stipulated record developed, a question of law can surface, and many different things can happen that will avoid the necessity of having to rehear the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.318" offset="3704665">I would suggest that a real swearing contest such as occurred in this case is really rather unusual.</text>

            <text syncTime="1072.234" offset="4392312">The first question is the standard of review when a finding is objected to, and I don't believe that there is any conflict between the parties in this case that the judge is supposed to make an independent determination of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.697" offset="4442154">The government states in its brief that the judge would be violating the statue if he deferred to the magistrate on fact-findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.462" offset="4473187">So I think on that point there is agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.146" offset="4479979">The problem arises on the question of what procedures the judge has to follow in evaluating the magistrate's recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.786" offset="4510490">And what the legislative history says, it is true that the statement that the government has quoted consistently in its brief, the use of the words de novo determination is not intended to require the judge to actually conduct a new hearing on contested issues, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.076" offset="4567646">But the government consistently omits the two explanatory sentences which follow, which state that normally the judge upon application would consider the record which has been developed before the magistrate and make his own determination on the basis of that record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.925" offset="4619055">But in some specific instances, however, it may be necessary for the judge to modify or reject the findings of the magistrate, take additional evidence, to recall witnesses or to recommit the matter to the magistrate for further proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.124" offset="8639822">The more recent federal authorities seem to be working on some standard for de novo which give more play to the possibility of eliminating some issues than those old cases did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.639" offset="8689977">We could have argued that the judge was required to redo it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.251" offset="8704397">It seemed that in view of the purposes of the legislation and the statements in the congressional history that the proper approach was the approach taken by some of these recent federal decisions which indicate that de novo requires reconsideration of live evidence only to the extent that issues like credibility, motivation, veracity and those kinds of issues were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.123" offset="8795826">Apart from that, the district judge has a great deal of discretion to try to work out stipulations, to admit the prior record, and engage in a number of duplication-saving devices as long as he puts himself in a position to make a truly independent decision on the credibility questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.014" offset="8911391">I would like to speak for a minute, because I think that the government's position comes down largely to the question of the costs of rehearing and the costs in terms of economic and administrative considerations of, number one, not sending the motions to suppress to magistrates and, number two, requiring the judge to hear selected evidence rather than reading the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.032" offset="9015463">We have included in our brief some recent statistics that indicate that the whole issue of suppression motions, the hearing of suppression motions are not in any event a very substantial part of the workload of district judges or magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.820" offset="9078680">But beyond that, it seems to me that the best answer to that argument is the docket sheet in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.976" offset="9103235">The government says that the interests of judicial efficiency has been saved by this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.471" offset="9121207">Well, all there was was a reading of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.925" offset="9131029">But I would like to suggest that this motion to suppress would in all likelihood have been heard by a district judge in a day and ruled on from the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.654" offset="9166033">What in fact happened was that it took five months, and the reason it took five months was because first the magistrate had to hold a hearing and then a transcript had to be prepared, which is not that common in most motions to suppress that I have been involved in if there is not going to be an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.510" offset="9229458">The parties, the lawyers, both of whom were government lawyers, had to prepare proposed factfindings and recommendations, the magistrate had to review all of this material and write a report to the district judge with proposed fact-findings, the parties had to file objections to the magistrate's report, the district judge had to read all of this record which by this time included a voluminous transcript, presumably in many cases he would hear oral argument and then he had to go about the process of trying to decide from the transcript with all this conflicting testimony what in fact happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.304" offset="9368639">Now, if any time were to be saved by having the district judge rehear selected testimony rather than reading this transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.510" offset="9401448">I would submit that it would be a very minimal savings at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.093" offset="9415764">And we have included in our brief some references to some recent congressional hearings in which district judges have begged Congress not to give them appellate-type duties with respect to magistrate civil trial jurisdiction because they find that it is quicker for them to hear the issues again rather than reading through a transcript.</text>
