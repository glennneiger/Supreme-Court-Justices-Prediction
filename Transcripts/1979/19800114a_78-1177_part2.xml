            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Macpherson.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ian A. Macpherson</label>
            <text syncTime="17.203" offset="172178">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.589" offset="181687">I believe when we broke for lunch I was attempting to respond to one of the questions that Mr. Justice Stevens had asked of counsel for the amicus curiae United States with respect to the competitive advantage enjoyed by the tribe with respect to a situation if these taxes were voided.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.676" offset="270085">The State of Arizona finds nothing in the Federal scheme, either the Code of Federal Regulations or the Federal statutes, which would suggest a prohibition upon the tribe as any other business and profit-motivated entity from itself seeking to recover these costs when it engages in the business of marketing the timber product.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.611" offset="377814">We concede that that is not sufficient grounds in and of itself to substantiate the imposition of the taxes upon the non-Indian in the first place.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="78.145" stopTime="89.235">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="78.145" offset="415953">Would there be anything constitutionally wrong about the Congress undertaking to give the Indian tribes some competitive advantage?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ian_a_macpherson" startTime="89.235" stopTime="566.161">
            <label>Mr. Ian A. Macpherson</label>
            <text syncTime="89.235" offset="460361">Mr. Chief Justice, I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.117" offset="467884">It is our position, however, that they simply haven't done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.486" offset="481364">What Congress has done through the enactment of the Federal statutes and what has been authorized insofar as Federal regulations is concerned simply does not concern that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.206" offset="524204">It concerns the preservation and maintenance of the forest resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.635" offset="545938">And contrary, at least in Arizona's position, to the argument advanced by Pinetop, there is no articulable objective in the Federal scheme mandating that the entire economic benefit of the tribal resource come to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.553" offset="613543">Rather, the language used is whatever economic benefit it may generate.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.205" offset="636217">It is one thing to state that the entire economic benefit should come to the tribe, thereby suggesting that any and all cost which somehow burden the accomplishment of that objective are prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.175" offset="692120">In fact the Federal regulatory scheme contemplates just the opposite with respect to the administrative charge provision when the Bureau of Indian Affairs is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.600" offset="737782">So the State of Arizona's position on Mr. Justice Stevens' question is that, yes, there may be a competitive advantage if these taxes are voided.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.240" offset="776338">However, Congress -- neither Congress nor the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in our estimation, has acted to insulate the Indians from those cost burdens; and, in fact, in pursuance of the Federal objective it would seem that they could recover these costs just as they recover the costs of the actual board feet charge that is contemplated under the contract with Pinetop.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.783" offset="890546">It is sound business practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.373" offset="900890">There is nothing in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.799" offset="906533">Indeed, it is a good objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.771" offset="918444">And they may follow that.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.653" offset="925968">With respect to the Hayden-Cartwright Act, although it is stated in the petitioner's reply brief that the State's principal defense of its use fuel tax of the Hayden-Cartwright Act, I feel it incumbent that the Court be aware that the Hayden-Cartwright Act at least in so many words, that it was first raised by the petitioners in an attempt to demonstrate that it did not apply by the petitioners in an attempt to demonstrate that it did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.912" offset="1039026">But upon further examination, the Hayden-Cartwright Act in the State of Arizona's estimation does indeed, even if all these other arguments be rejected, does constitute the type of specific Federal regulation contemplated under Williams v. Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.985" offset="1107362">The rule in Williams v. Lee of course is that absent congressional enactments the question becomes whether or not the State law infringes upon the right of self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.765" offset="1150412">If all of Arizona's previous arguments be rejected, the fact remains that the Hayden-Cartwright Act appears to be precisely that kind of legislation contemplated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.320" offset="1192626">We have cited and direct the Court's attention to another Solicitor's opinion, 57 ID-129.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.065" offset="1223659">In that particular opinion Solicitor Margold as I recall discusses the application of the Hayden-Cartwright Act to the operations of the Menominee Mills, and in that opinion he specifically states that while sales of motor vehicle fuels for use in the direct operations of the Menominee tribal saw mill would be exempt from the State motor vehicle fuel taxes in wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.499" offset="1357406">The fact is that he decided that, or he opined that in the context of a Federal instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.688" offset="1390111">In the present case we don't have a Federal instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.230" offset="1404322">We have a non-Indian independent contractor, and there is some dispute as to the terminology -- I think the record speaks for itself in the verified complaint -- establishes that Pinetop Logging is an independent contractor who is a non-Indian who bears the legal incidents of these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.749" offset="1474330">As a matter of contract doctrine, he passes them on.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.550" offset="1493556">The opinion goes on, however, to specifically opine that the Hayden-Cartwright Act was intended by Congress to apply to Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.539" offset="1537546">The Solicitor goes through several discussions and tracings of evidences in the legislative history of the Hayden- Cartwright Act which established in his mind an attempt on behalf of Congress to permit the application of these taxes on Indian reservations including, in Arizona's estimation as we read the opinion, the direct application of these State motor vehicle fuel taxes to Indians on the Indian reservation, provided only that they be not imposed upon the operations of the Menominee sawmill itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.499" offset="1681324">Indeed, employees of the mill, Indian employees of the mill, at page 140 of the opinion, are specifically opined to be subject to the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.384" offset="1724897">In point of fact, the Solicitor refers to his memorandum for the Commissioner of Indian Affairs of February 4, 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.187" offset="1764080">I would submit to the Court that in the tracing of the history of both the Hayden-Cartwright Act and the Buck Act, that particular memorandum of February 4, 1938, which is now available, in the opinions of the Solicitor, establishes some very interesting points, primary amongst them being the fact that where the tax under consideration is a true sales tax, that is a vendee responsibility tax, then, and for that reason, must the State tax be voided with respect to its application to Indians on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.865" offset="1914859">An examination of the opinion, however, will also reveal that it discusses it in the context of the Utah sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.532" offset="1945475">At that point in time Utah had a true sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.851" offset="1962820">The taxable event was the transfer of tangible personal property, the liability for the tax by mandate of State law, was upon the vendee.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.907" offset="1998973">It is not surprising, therefore, that in that opinion he arrived at the conclusion that to impose these taxes upon an Indian tribe on the Uintah Reservation in Utah would be impermissible, whether the taxes be imposed on transactions by the Indians or purchases from the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.532" offset="2085491">In that regard, the opinion in the Moe case seems to have eroded somewhat even that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.643" offset="2117987">This Court should be aware -- and I am sure it is -- that in the Moe case all we were talking about is putting the shoe on the other foot, as it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.893" offset="2150902">The economic burden of the State tax, at least for a certain period of time, was placed not by contract but by mandate of State law directly upon an Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.989" offset="2199280">Joe Wheeler was an Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.776" offset="2206490">The record is unclear as to whether or not he is a licensed Indian trader but clearly he appears to have been engaged in that kind of activity on the reservation that fits the definition of Indian trader.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.243" offset="2244315">We don't know if he is an Indian of the whole blood and therefore exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.404" offset="2256959">Nevertheless, he was an Indian on the Indian reservation, he was subjected by mandate of State law to the pre-collection of the Montana taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.180" offset="2296142">This Court upheld it in a unanimous opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.399" offset="2308995">The fact of the matter is that when Mr. Wheeler charged or added the price of the tax on to the non-Indians, in effect what he was doing was reimbursing himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.644" offset="2349955">The tax had already been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.427" offset="2357060">It had been pre-collected for purposes of convenience only.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ian A. Macpherson</label>
            <text syncTime="580.296" offset="2424560">He was required pre-collect it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="581.912" stopTime="585.548">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="581.912" offset="2431039">So, he was required to collect it from the vendee.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ian_a_macpherson" startTime="585.548" stopTime="931.894">
            <label>Mr. Ian A. Macpherson</label>
            <text syncTime="585.548" offset="2445563">Excuse me, and you are quite correct, Your Honor, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.355" offset="2460818">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.684" offset="2466147">But the rationale of the decision makes it clear that the reason that the tax was upheld, contrary to the prior three sections of the opinion; in other words, we are talking about section 4 of the opinion right now, in the prior three sections we are discussing situations where the direct legal incidents of the Montana taxes under consideration there were upon Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.241" offset="2552351">On the contrary, with respect to sales to non-Indians in Montana, the legal incidents of the tax was upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.437" offset="2577115">And this pre-collection requirement was not as a result of contract or anything like that, but by mandate of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.228" offset="2604283">So we view the Moe case as being highly relevant in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.639" offset="2621942">With respect, again, to Mr. Margold's memorandum of February 4, 1938, if one goes even further to examine the surrounding circumstances of that memorandum, it will be discovered that almost without exception, at least to the extent I have had time to do the research on it, the impression that existed with respect to that opinion was that invariably a sales tax was a vendee responsibility tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.841" offset="2766764">In the context of that opinion, he was talking about the Utah sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.944" offset="2783169">The Utah sales tax at that time was a vendee responsibility tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.357" offset="2800828">This is also true with respect to the Buck Act legislative history with respect to, for example, Congressman Dempsey's view as to the application of the sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.638" offset="2849938">He makes some references to this tax is required to be collected by the vendor and remitted to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.938" offset="2879091">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.397" offset="2880972">He was from New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.504" offset="2885360">At that time New Mexico had a vendee responsibility to sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.932" offset="2903124">So it is not surprising that in the discussion of the situation surrounding legislative history of the Buck Act one finds upon an examination of the facts that I have been able to discover in the legislative history that the overriding concern of the people who are testifying with respect to the Buck Act was over legal incidents of State taxes required by mandate of State law to be imposed upon Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.091" offset="3023705">Those were impermissible, we have no problem with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.277" offset="3040528">Under the present state of the law, Indians on the reservation are exempt from the direct legal application of State loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.658" offset="3066023">But there is nothing, I would submit, in the histories of either the Hayden-Cartwright Act or the Buck Act and, indeed, the indications are just the contrary, of an intention on the part of the Congress to insulate Indians from non-discriminatory, contractually assumed coats, just like anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.854" offset="3150764">Arizona does not have at least, with respect to the Pinetop situation, no requirement of State law whatsoever, that these taxes be passed on and visited upon an Indian entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.224" offset="3216280">With respect to the argument that somehow the Hayden-Cartwright Act does not apply because supposedly there is no sale occurring on the reservation, Arizona would submit that that simply does not comport with the legislative intent as supported by the legislative history of the Hayden-Cartwright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.619" offset="3297886">Quite the contrary, the legislative history as demonstrated through Mr. Margold's opinion, supports the notion that it was the intent of Congress in the various amendments that it made after the initial enactment of the Hayden-Cartwright Act rather than restrict the rights of the States, to expand the rights of the States to impose these taxes even on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.158" offset="3396002">We have cited, and do has the United States' amicus curiae decisions in the AGE Corporation case as well as Sanders v. Oklahoma Tax Commission, interestingly enough by way of brief -- correction -- it should be noted that on page 13 of the reply brief the citation is made to the decision State v. Yellowstone State Park Co., well, by way of correction I am sure it is a typographical error, the decision was not made in 1972, thereby suggesting it is a more recent decision than is the decision in Sanders, it was made in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.712" offset="3546258">This Court denied cert in that case in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.935" offset="3571127">It also denied cert in the Sanders case which reaches an opposite conclusion with respect to the application of the Hayden-Cartwright Act, even in the absence of a sale, in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.369" offset="3612818">So it remains the State of the State of Arizona's position that the better recent view is as set forth in AGE court in Sanders v. Oklahoma Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.070" offset="3659630">By way of summary, if I may, the area that has been preempted here is not the area of contractual negotiation between tribe and non-Indian entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.796" offset="3714591">The area that has been preempted is that of sound civil-cultural forestry management.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.607" offset="3737788">If the State of Arizona were attempting to tell them and where they could get trees this would be a very different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.533" offset="3765478">We are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.274" offset="3768508">We are dealing only with a non-indian entity who is hauling logs on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.498" offset="3793377">The State of Arizona's position is that those taxes are value imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.315" offset="3812603">With that, are there any further questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="929.190" offset="3820126">Well, thank you.</text>
