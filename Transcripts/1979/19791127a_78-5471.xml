            <text syncTime="85.612" offset="445837">Two of these counts -- robbery and felony murder premised on it -- were dismissed by the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.622" offset="617827">Our position is that if the murder in this case is proven by the Government in a way that does not depend on proof of the underlying felony, then we would not claim that there was any double jeopardy violation in punishing consecutively for the felony and for the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.178" offset="704136">And we said in our brief that we are not challenging on double jeopardy grounds consecutive sentences for rape and the second degree murder count here.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.656" offset="746036">Our position is not that simply because there is one victim there can only be one sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.792" offset="882500">First, the felony murder statute in the District of Columbia, and most felony murder statutes do, is to impose a rule of strict liability with respect to murder occurring in the course of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.161" offset="939969">The District of Columbia statute, for example, makes the penalty for such a murder -- first degree murder -- it makes the murder first degree murder and it makes the penalty for that murder 20 years to life, mandatory sentence 20 years to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.227" offset="1008306">And that can be for killing which is otherwise blameless, the killing was just unforeseen, unforeseeable, unintended.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.966" offset="1035264">Because of the legislative judgment that -- necessary only if a felony were so dangerous to society, that if life is taken in the course of commission of a felony, you should be treated just as if you had the intent to murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.467" offset="1109243">Well, Congress might have wanted to do that, but it is obvious that Congress didn't want to do that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.261" offset="1136410">That is a separate argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.063" offset="1139649">This is an argument we made, that Congress didn't intend consecutive sentences in this case; and we made that argument based on the legislative history and the structure in felony murder statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.068" offset="1183640">The double jeopardy argument is a different one.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.321" offset="1192626">It is that to prove felony murder, a murder which carries 20 years to life, whereas the underlying felony without a killing would carry no mandatory sentence and would be punishable by provision if the judge chose to impose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.566" offset="1273605">Our argument of double jeopardy is that when a felony murder can only be proved by proof of the underlying offense, that is the felony, then the felony is a lesser included offense of the felony murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="977.354" offset="4012805">It is our position that Congress did not in fact provide in any sense that these punishments be impossible consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.727" offset="4042271">In fact our position is that the legislative history and the structure of these statutes indicates if anything that Congress did not intend to permit the courts to cumulate punishments for felony murder and the underlying felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.339" offset="4104756">I don't think there is any question that the felony murder statute, is one of the interests that is protected by that statute is the interest in saving human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.319" offset="4144671">But it does so in a way and is structured in such a way, that it seems apparent another interest to be protected in that rule -- in that statute is the same interest that is protected by the underlying felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.219" offset="4192214">Congress didn't after all make it first degree murder to kill under any circumstances in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.171" offset="4220008">It didn't impose a rule of strict liability for any killing, and impose a mandatory sentence of 20 years to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.569" offset="4245608">It is only if the killing occurs in the course of the felony that such a penalty is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.597" offset="4265775">It is our position that that indicates very strongly that what Congress meant to do by the felony murder statute was to punish the person, hold him culpable both for killing and for committing the underlying felony during which the killing occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.773" offset="4334425">The Government to a great extent I think gets mileage out of the facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.459" offset="4521253">They make murder first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.867" offset="4530866">They make a killing, rather, first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.767" offset="4538389">In the District of Columbia at least, that killing carries a mandatory penalty of 20 years to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.052" offset="4555630">No matter what the judge wants to do the defendant convicted of first degree murder is going to spend 20 years of his life in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.622" offset="4589902">Any other form of homicide, second degree, manslaughter, the judge can give a sentence of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.417" offset="4625011">That is true also with respect to any of the underlying felonies can be the predicate for felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.240" offset="4648312">It seems also that the structure of the statute reveals that Congress intended to punish in part for the felony, because the statute imposes a rule of strict liability where the killing occurs in the course of six enumerated serious felonies and requires that for it to be first degree murder, a felony, as any other felony the murder has to be purposeful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.693" offset="4770147">This in our view also indicates that Congress when it enacted the penalty provisions -- when it enacted the felony murder statute and structured it the way it did -- clearly intended that the punishment for the felony murder would incorporate the notion of liability for the underlying felony as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.660" offset="4833991">This is why in our position if a court punishes a defendant consecutively for a felony murder and for the felony on which it is promised, in a very real and palpable sense it is imposing double punishment for that felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.027" offset="6667473">Also, as we argue in our brief, it seems to me that the decisions of this Court, or a plurality opinion of this Court in Jeffers as well as the dissenting opinion in Jeffers, both indicate that in deciding whether two offenses -- whether one offense is a lesser included offense than the other, you look to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.291" offset="6752528">You don't just look to the statute in the abstract and see what could have been charged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.391" offset="6828910">Well, I think that Jeffers and Iannelli read together certainly do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.802" offset="6846568">The way Jeffers talked about Iannelli and the way Jeffers emphasized -- I think it was Footnotes 15 and 16 of Iannelli -- I think the court was making just about this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.651" offset="6889932">I have very little time left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.308" offset="6896619">I would just say that I think our brief adequately covers our argument that even if the double jeopardy clause doesn't apply here to absolutely bar consecutive punishments, that is even if the Government's position is accepted, any kind of reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes would have led the Court of Appeals to conclude that Congress did not here intend consecutive punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.605" offset="7013752">The legislative history of the penalty provisions to the felony murder statutes which were enacted in 1962 show quite clearly that those members of Congress who addressed themselves to this question felt that for a fatal felony murder the defendant's effective sentence should not be greater than the sentence for pre-meditated first degree murder, that is 20 years to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.701" offset="7118137">In the Government's view, every time a felony murder is proved the defendant would be subject to a penalty considerably longer than 20 years to life sentence which the congressmen thought was sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.454" offset="7181145">All the congressmen that spoke to the issue indicated that they thought 20 years in prison for the single felony murder was enough time to be eligible for parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.226" offset="7220328">It doesn't mean that he is going to be paroled, but it means he would be eligible after 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.109" offset="7235793">It is also, we argue, implicit in the structure of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.540" offset="7249481">But more importantly, it is our argument that if double jeopardy doesn't operate to bar absolutely punishment for two offenses that are the same, under Blockburger, at the very least it creates a very strong constitutionally-based presumption that where two offenses are the same, under Blockburger, consecutive punishment should not be imposed unless the legislative intent that they be imposed is unmistakably clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.333" offset="7692727">From one standpoint this appears to be a case that deals with an arcane and esoteric corner of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.244" offset="7720312">It lends itself to subtle linguistic disputes regarding the meaning of such terms as "same offense" and "lesser included offense" as well as to elaborate efforts to plumb the depths of the mysterious Blockburger test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.962" offset="7775169">It has produced from Petitioner and intricate analysis of snippets of dictum in Brown v. Ohio, in Jeffers, and in Simpson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.855" offset="7814771">And I can't deny that we too have engaged in our brief in a serious effort to analyze comprehensively this complex and interesting talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.486" offset="7857298">There is however a danger in all of this the Court will lose sight of the forest for the trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.631" offset="7881853">So let me draw back for a minute to make one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.220" offset="7900244">It seems to me both futile and absolutely devastating to Petitioner's contention that the double jeopardy clause bars Congress from imposing cumulative punishments for rape and felony murder because the two offenses are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.581" offset="7965654">Suppose Congress had enacted a statute that stated as follows - "Anyone who kills another person in the course of committing a rape shall be sentenced to a maximum term of life imprisonment and to a minimum term in the discretion of the sentencing court of not less than 20 nor more than 35 years."</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.889" offset="8042977">Now, it seems to me beyond argument, given the power of the legislature to define offenses and to set punishments for them, that the double jeopardy clause would have no bearing whatsoever on the validity of such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.549" offset="8097520">And that is exactly what the Court of Appeals construed the statute in this case to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.230" offset="8124270">Now, it is true Congress expressed its will by means of two separate statutes, which must be read together to give the result of my hypothetical statute, but surely the double jeopardy clause cannot be construed to require that the legislature employ a particular form of words or that it do something in one section rather than two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.784" offset="8202533">Such a reading would trivialize this important constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.335" offset="8220714">This is precisely the conclusion that this Court reached in Gore where it said about, after analyzing the hypothetical statute such as I have given, is it conceivable that such a statute would not be within the power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.194" offset="8288110">And is it rational to find such a statute constitutional but to strike that on the Blockburger doctrine as violative of the double jeopardy clause or here to strike down the two separate statutes as violative of the double jeopardy clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.108" offset="8347773">Now, let me turn back from the forest to the trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.636" offset="8365955">Petitioner's argument rests upon the notion that because proof of felony murder requires the proof of the underlying felony, the latter is a lesser included offense of the felony murder and therefore is the same offense and therefore may not be made the subject of multiple punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.016" offset="8439411">He says the Blockburger test is a constitutional test under the double jeopardy clause for the permissibility of multiple punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.024" offset="8467519">There are several difficulties with his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.947" offset="8483192">The first difficulty is that rape and felony murder are not in fact the same offense under the Blockburger test, which depends upon the elements of the two offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.546" offset="8529586">Obviously, one need not kill in order to rape or rape in order to kill.</text>
