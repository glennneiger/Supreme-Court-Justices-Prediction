            <label>Mr. William T. Chidlaw</label>
            <text syncTime="71.270" offset="388472">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.429" offset="405086">The case we have before us now involves the state's power to regulate liquor within a state's borders as opposed to the Commerce Clause and specifically a statute enacted under the Commerce Clause, namely the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.273" offset="480423">In this particular case, the City of California has an extensive comprehensive Alcohol and Beverage Control Act which includes within its provisions two that are specifically involved in this case dealing with wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.254" offset="540400">And those two sections require that the price at which wine will be sold from wholesale to retail be posted with the department and the other section requires that the wine we sold at a price no lower than that price typically.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.021" offset="623470">The case involves the setting of that -- of those prices specifically this case involves wholesale to retail, those are the facts of this case, but the statute involves that both that wholesale to retail price and the retail to consumer price for wine in California be set generally by the wine producer, that is a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.341" offset="724720">The problem that we have and the reason we're here today is because the California Supreme Court in a case that was decided approximately year before the instant case ruled that the requirement that the manufactures of distilled sprits set the price from retailer to consumer was invalid as being in conflict with the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.226" offset="828270">And in this case, our Court of Appeals said that it was bound to follow that California Supreme Court case and apply it not only at the retail to consumer for wine level but also at the wholesale to retail level.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.221" offset="892217">In other words, extending that case somewhat on the basis primarily that the -- there was no difference in our Court of Appeals' mind between a manufacturer setting the price from retail to consumer and a manufacture setting the price from wholesale to retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.902" offset="958986">We think there are some difference between that (Inaudible) basis and purpose of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.743" offset="982392">However, I think and those are covered in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.913" offset="991065">So I don't think that in view of the situation and the issue involved in this case that that necessarily needs to be discussed at oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.937" offset="1035160">The Court of Appeal declared both those statutes to be invalid following the Rice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.647" offset="1069955">Now the Rice case by our California Supreme Court evolved -- the Court evolved a new test.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.072" offset="1111646">We find this test in no other cases either in California or in the -- in the cases of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.611" offset="1153860">And what the court did in that case, the California Supreme Court did was to take various cases by this Court in which state regulation of liquor had been involved but which had involved provisions of the Constitution other than the Commerce Clause for instance, the First Amendment like in LaRue or the Fourteenth Amendment like in Wisconsin versus Constantineau which was a due process case.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_t_chidlaw" startTime="302.217" stopTime="419.183">
            <label>Mr. William T. Chidlaw</label>
            <text syncTime="302.217" offset="1312266">Well, I would think that if we prevail here that this Court in order to eliminate the uncertainty and confusion caused by that case will overrule the Rice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.743" offset="1346330">We're asking you to reverse the case that's specifically before you, but to overrule Rice case and eliminate its effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.725" offset="1378304">We have not briefed but there was a case pending for the Court of Appeal in New York today which was argued a week ago, Monday which involves the fair trade wine retail to consumer in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.687" offset="1438072">The Castlewood case implications in that case which was a case in which the federal regulations under the -- from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco And Firearms ran and hit on into a state statute from Florida that in which there was a conflict about what discounts were proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.229" offset="1508289">That case is I understand the time for filing with this Court is not yet expired and there's a suggestion in the footnote from respondent Midcal that that case maybe on its way here.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.579" offset="1565654">Kansas just past session enacted a new regulatory scheme for Alcoholic Beverages where they abandoned the idea that administratively they would set the prices for liquor in Kansas and instead adopted minimum markup statute where in effect the outsider, the private, the third party or whoever sets the price or the cost and then state simply says what percentage the retailer will add to that price.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.118" offset="1699819">There are other aspects of the Kansas law that also would be I think deemed to involve anti-competitive situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.612" offset="1733778">So, there are a number of cases around the country that are involved in the same basic problem that the Rice case has created, this balancing of the interest test.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="419.183" offset="1780067">Mr. Chidlaw, in response to Justice Blackmun's question, you said you felt we should overrule the Rice case which is I understand is a California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.491" offset="1825311">I reminded of what I think is the statement of Mr. Justice Brandeis in one of the opinions of this Court that all this Court can do in its order if it reverses a state Supreme Court or state Appellate Court as to say, it's reversed for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.452" offset="1905142">That doesn't mean that the reasoning of the opinion couldn't cast doubt on the Rice case, but surely we couldn't say in the opinion that the Rice case is overruled that -- that's a matter of state law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_t_chidlaw" startTime="461.390" stopTime="633.352">
            <label>Mr. William T. Chidlaw</label>
            <text syncTime="461.390" offset="1948923">Well, I would presume, I think your point is well taken Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would presume that if and when this Court rules that our position on the relative importance of the two constitutional provisions, they were correct on that that the California Supreme Court would follow the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.151" offset="2028022">I don't think this Court can avoid ruling on the question that was the basis of the Rice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.603" offset="2061772">So, and I would presume that our California Supreme Court would follow this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.839" offset="2082774">So, I don't think it would be an idle act on those matters and on the specific case, I don't think there's -- there would be any -- any problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.561" offset="2125615">I think that we've covered in our briefs, this Court has explored this -- the difference between a state statute that's regulating liquor when it conflicts with the Commerce Clause and always upheld that and discussed, this Court has discussed the Fourteenth Amendment and the due process equal protection exceptions to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.125" offset="2251839">This Court discussed over and over again the federal enclave exception where the goods are intended for federal law enclave and foreign commerce like in the Hostetter versus Idlewild.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.622" offset="2301889">So, I think that that there is no question that the balancing of interest test that was evolved by the California Supreme Court is simply based on an erroneous interpretation of those exception cases that did not involve the Commerce Clause running here on and to regulation of liquor within a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.976" offset="2391228">Now, it's been suggested by both Midcal and the Solicitor General in its brief that if we give to the Twenty-first Amendment that which I believe this Court is always given it as far as the state's power is concerned, that allows the state to in the name of regulating liquor to regulate the hours of employment and securities requirements and they've conjured up a situation which would involve all kinds of conflicts with other federal laws and I think the simple answer to that contention is that the state has to be regulating liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.222" offset="2548276">If the state is trying to regulate securities in the name of liquor or the wages and hours in name of liquor or even freedom of speech for instance like in LaRue where there was no -- if there is no connection with regulating liquor, I think that in those cases clearly the state has the power.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.352" offset="2636779">Mr. Chidlaw, just to pursue that for second, supposing they passed a statute that said the wages of a driver of a vehicle transporting liquor from place to place within the state shall be such as has posted by whatever company engaged in the driving business, sort of like this where you post the price for the wholesale and everybody has to follow, why couldn't they do the same thing to regulate wages the same way, either the union or the employer do the posting, make the legislative choice and then prevail over the National Labor Relations Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="761.647" offset="3149928">There are, there's an Unfair Practices Act that prohibits that.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.005" offset="3163408">There -- our California Supreme Court has observed however there's a very difficult to prove violations of that and therefore, our California Supreme Court in past has said that one of the purposes of this act is to make proof easy in these type of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.698" offset="3238118">I think that the California Supreme Court in using words like “picking up” words, this Court used like “pro tanto repeal” and each considered in the light of the other referring to constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.600" offset="3293811">I think they've gotten off the track and the regard and I think the important phrase is to look at when you're examining the state statute under the Twenty-First Amendment are phrases that have been used by this Court like unfettered by the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.415" offset="3369044">And I think that Justice Frankfurter is the one that said the rules of the state and federal government were reversed in the field of liquor regulation as far as the Commerce Clause was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.339" offset="3412720">This Court has said has recently as LaRue that the states are totally unconfined by traditional Commerce Clause limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.777" offset="3450441">I'd like to go from those remarks into what is now have been raised for the first time in this case and that is the idea that the Twenty-First Amendment because of the language used and because of some quotations from some of legislative history simply allows a state to either prohibit or restrict imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.429" offset="3565066">And I think jumping ahead, I think the answer to that contention is that this Court has never so held but more importantly is if that were the only thing that Twenty-First Amendment did if that was the only power that that gave to the states then the state's -- that would constitute a freezing of the Twenty-First Amendment concept in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.567" offset="3689618">In other words, in 1933, the Commerce Clause had not been ruled by this Court to extend the far reaches that it has today and at that time when they were discussing the Twenty-First Amendment everyone knew that the state had the power to regulate commerce generally once it had gotten beyond this interstate commerce as interpreted then, that concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.469" offset="3797243">So therefore to have specified specifically that a state has the power to regulate liquor within its borders and say it in more specific language than they had would have been suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.914" offset="3855026">If we were to go back to the Sherman Act in 1890, as one of -- as one of the Justices and I -- forgive me I don't remember which one but in a -- either concurring opinion or dissent pointed out that in 1890 when the Sherman Act was being debated there was a lot of languages on the floor of Congress indicating the Sherman Act was not intended to extend into the states' borders and indeed it didn't until the 30's -- middle 30's.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.999" offset="3971323">So, what counsel is contending for with this argument about in fact wet dry, the state simply has a right to remain dry and to prohibit the imports is to freeze the Twenty-First Amendment effect and allow the Commerce Clause effect to go right on up-to-date and I would suggest to this Court as I think I have in the brief that unfettered by the Commerce Clause means unfettered by the Commerce Clause as it exists today not as it existed in 1933.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.827" offset="5314644">I'd like to make some remarks about the state action part of the case and I believe that the best way for all of us to look at it is in a schematic way just first look at originally the United States of America didn't have any anti-competitive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.786" offset="5414536">There were some general or vague common law of principles coming down from old English law and then the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was passed and that was the first time we really had a federal law relating to the anti-competitive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.434" offset="5505128">And then subsequent to that, we had Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts which permitted an exception to the Sherman Act and permitted any commodity, the manufacture of any commodity to determine what his retail price for that product should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.973" offset="5599274">And then schematically came along the state laws relating to fair-trade in alcoholic beverages and super imposed on all list, was the Parker-Brown state action exemption and I think to see how it all fits together, we have to look at the differences between Miller-Tydings type of fair-trade which I sometimes call regular fair-trade and state liquor fair-trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.580" offset="5741693">And then the Miller-Tydings regular fair-trade you have two factors; one is that the regulation of the fair-trade is totally optional both on the manufacturer and on the retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.679" offset="5794043">The manufacturer can say, “I desire to fair-trade my merchandise or I do not do so.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.492" offset="8857370">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.135" offset="8871894">Respondent Midcal would like to commence with the brief description of the statute the Court which I think is required in response to an argument made by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.099" offset="8923721">In order to decide this case correctly, it's important to understand that this is a maintenance statute, a vertical price maintenance statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.057" offset="8963636">You heard the petitioner argue that one of the state's interests behind this statute was to prevent price discrimination at the hands of wholesalers against retailers and raised the concept of posting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.284" offset="9032495">I want to try to get across if I can the difference between posting and price maintenance and make it as clear as I can that the statute we have here is a price maintenance statute and not a posting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.475" offset="9085262">In the cert petition here the assertion was made that an affirmance in this case would continue the effect of invalidating a lot of state statutes around the country dealing with posting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.211" offset="9136253">That isn't correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.540" offset="9145553">Posting is a phenomenon undertaken in some state liquor codes by which a wholesaler for example is required to post its own price, that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.066" offset="9195604">There is no control over that entity's price by someone further up in the vertical chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.770" offset="9230503">Posting is a simply a price publication situation by the entity that sets the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.897" offset="9254954">The bulk of the statutes that are cited to you in the petition in the chain of horribles argument which is given there are posting statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.086" offset="9295705">What we have here is a maintenance statute --</text>

            <text syncTime="2301.472" offset="9309288">Mr. Owens, if in the absence of statute, do you think a posting practice engaged in by sellers would be violative of any of the anti-trust laws?</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.552" offset="9373550">It would depend on whether the act of posting occurred in the right economic structure of the market if it were concentrated market and it led to horizontal exchange of price data there would be a question posed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.462" offset="9425272">The question posed in an earlier era in the Seagram's case and addressed by Mr. Justice Stewart in his opinion there, yes, there is a risk of an anti-trust violation in a posting statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.793" offset="9534568">That's considerably different from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.750" offset="9546376">This case and if you would envision a four level industry producers, wholesalers, distributors and consumers, what we have here is the producers setting the price for the wholesalers and the retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.728" offset="9606248">It's a maintenance case, it's not a posting case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.463" offset="9621191">And if to give petitioner the point, if the state has an interest in preserving or preventing price discrimination, this is not the way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.826" offset="9662673">This is not the system to accomplish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.860" offset="9674794">It can be accomplished if it's something important to accomplish about part from the standard requirements of federal anti-trust law or state anti-trust law for the system which is far less abusive of federal anti-trust interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="2421.633" offset="9789942">I -- if I understand your question Mr. Justice Rehnquist I believe that Parker turns on several important features which are not here and which maybe determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.726" offset="9834245">They are for example the fact that the state commission in the Parker case was mandated by the state legislature to determine whether the profits provided to the producers as a result of program were unreasonable, and further to review and measure the reason was to the programs which were entered into.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.722" offset="9930271">I thought it turned on the fact that it was the state that it mandated the action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2463.771" offset="9958484">No sir I don't think so because the opinion for the court indicates quite clearly that a state may not simply command what the Sherman Act forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.318" offset="10008639">With that statement in the opinion, the holding must be that what validated that particular program was the degree of state supervision and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.457" offset="10053151">And particularly I would stress the state's control over the profits received by the producers because what you have there and this is consistent with a lot of Mr. Justice Blackmun's writing in his opinion necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.355" offset="10096828">What you have there is the state creating a surrogate for the federal interest espoused in the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.950" offset="10123160">You have a state measuring the degree of profitability to the producers that comes out of such a program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.511" offset="10149386">That's totally absent in this system and I think the absence may will be determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.253" offset="10180420">In any event what we have here is a maintenance statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.731" offset="10198288">The petitioner continually uses the phrase are comprehensive scheme extensive regulation scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.188" offset="10232142">The point is as indicated by Mr. Justice White there is no control by the state over these prices whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.070" offset="10263698">The fact that there is regulation in other areas is really irrelevant to the issue which is before us which is can a state simply command what the Sherman forbids which I believe the Court has declared twice is not the law, Parker and Schwegmann.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.131" offset="10339871">On the question of the other states if I can close up that point, I don't think it's determinative what the effect of this maybe on other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.210" offset="10372263">The law is the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.401" offset="10380936">You will decide as you see it correctly and the consequences in other states will not curb your judgment I suspect, but I think we have clear up the misconception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.530" offset="10417507">The only state in the country that has anything like the California system is New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.326" offset="10448645">There are three other states that have something like this, but the distinction maybe very important.</text>
