            <label>Mr. William M. Burke</label>
            <text syncTime="62.650" offset="353991">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.709" offset="370186">The issue in these cases is whether or not the contractual right of acceleration in a consumer' credit contract must be disclosed under the Truth In Lending Act, or Regulation Z, promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.447" offset="429119">The right of acceleration is not mentioned anywhere in the specific disclosure requirement of the Act or the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.346" offset="456808">In fact, acceleration isn't mentioned anywhere in any provision of the Act or the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.087" offset="479692">Respondents have relied on two different sections of the regulation in an effort to gleam a requirement on the part of the Petitioners to disclose the acceleration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.826" offset="518666">In the District Court the Respondents relied upon Section 226.8(b)(4) dealing with default charges and I will come to that section in more detail in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.017" offset="559417">In the Court of Appeals, the Ninth Circuit, the Respondents focused heavily upon 226.8(b) (7), which was not raised in the District Court, which deals with the creditor's rebate policy upon pre-payment of the pre-computed consumer credit contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.269" offset="616469">The facts in the case are simple and for the most part are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.336" offset="632665">The Milhollin's and Mrs. Baton entered into conditional sale contracts with the Petitioners for the purchase of motor vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.696" offset="662131">The contracts were immediately assigned to Ford Motor Credit Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.389" offset="680939">The contracts had provisions on both the front and the back side, with the front side serving as the Petitioner's disclosure statement required by the Truth In Landing Act and Regulation Z.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.862" offset="726810">The front side clearly disclosed all default charges imposed by the Petitioners in Paragraph 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.020" offset="751470">Paragraph 24 advised the Respondents that in the event they prepaid the consumer credit contract for any reason at any time, whether or not there was a default in acceleration, the consumer would receive a rebate in full of all unearned finances charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.433" offset="817089">This is consistent, by the way, with the Oregon rebate statute which requires such a rebate and was followed by the creditors as [ILLEGIBLE WORD] as the record indicates, at all times relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.961" offset="859199">The contract contained a default clause which contained the usual creditor remedies, including the right acceleration.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.886" offset="886888">This clause was set forth clearly in paragraph 19 of the contract on the reverse side, but was not separately repeated on the front side of the contract, the disclosure provisions of the Truth in Lending Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.870" offset="934849">The District Court could find no provision of the Act or the regulation requiring disclosure of acceleration clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.406" offset="960972">However, it held that the acceleration clause should be disclosed under the spirit of the Act, henceforth all creditors are required to do so.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="223.646" offset="997961">When you say "disclosed," just what do you embrace in that?</text>
            <text syncTime="227.361" offset="1012799">Is it the manner in which it is made known or is it the matter of making it known or not making it?</text>

            <label>Mr. William M. Burke</label>
            <text syncTime="232.665" offset="1034010">Well, the provisions of the Truth In Lending Act require certain types of disclosures of contractual provisions in consumer credit contracts; as an example the pre-payment disclosure semantically what the Act and regulation require is that the creditor provide on the front side and on one page a disclosure of his pre-payment rebate policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.211" offset="1120214">So when we talk about the disclosure we are talking about certain specific enumerated provisions of the Act and the regulation that must be put together on one side and on, one piece of paper of the contract.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="264.803" stopTime="267.407">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. William M. Burke</label>
            <text syncTime="267.407" offset="1172982">Yes, 226.6 (a), Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_m_burke" startTime="271.050" stopTime="458.162">
            <label>Mr. William M. Burke</label>
            <text syncTime="271.050" offset="1187610">It is in Section 226.6(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="273.981" offset="1199313">Now the Respondents fell into default under the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.211" offset="1216240">After efforts by Ford Motor Credit to bring the contracts current failed, the vehicles were repossessed and these Truth In Lending actions followed by the Respondents against the Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.030" offset="1263470">The Ninth Circuit in its decision held that disclosures of acceleration clauses are never required under Section 226.8(b) (4), the default charge provisions of Regulation Z.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.971" offset="1315297">The court held that when a creditor accelerates payments, it accelerates the contract, it exercises the right of acceleration, that demand for payment in itself a pre-payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.059" offset="1355630">And therefore was able to hold under 226.8(b),(7) the creditor must disclose whether it rebates finance charges upon acceleration, and not pre-payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.071" offset="1395649">In the process, the Ninth Circuit rejected of the Federal Reserve Board's official staff interpretation of its own regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.811" offset="1422608">I might point out here that Section 226.8(b)(7) dealing with pre-payment, which is the basis of the Ninth Circuit decision below, has no counterpart in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.027" offset="1455522">This is a provision only in the regulation and has been interpreted by the Federal Reserve Board through its official staff interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.739" offset="1486346">We submit that a careful analysis of the applicable sections of the regulation, an application of the Federal Reserve Board's official staff interpretation, and substantial policy consideration dictate that the court's decision below should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.849" offset="1550817">The Federal Reserve Board has issued an official staff interpretation saying the disclosure requirements incident to an acceleration clause, with respect to Ford, which is printed in full in our opening brief, that requires that the creditor disclose the amount or method of computing the amount of any default, delinquency, or similar changes that are payable in the event of late payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.658" offset="1642036">The language in the Act is very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.089" offset="1651754">The Federal Reserve Board has include in its official staff interpretations that the right of acceleration is a creditor remedy, it is a contract right; it is not an amount that can be disclosed, nor it is payable with late payments of contract installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.515" offset="1713403">What the Board concluded in its OSI is that the right of acceleration need not be disclosed that is what is referred to in (b)(4) is specific pecuniary charges that are payable with late payments of the disclosed fully by the Petitioners in this case in paragraph 12 or their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.673" offset="1786023">I might note right here that this issue has been considered by seven Circuit Courts and virtually every Circuit has unanimously agreed with the Board on this issue, that the right of acceleration need not be disclosed under Section (b) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="433.822" offset="1838686">There is no conflict on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.180" offset="1848090">The Board has also concluded in its OSI that as long as the creditor rebates under its finance charges, upon pre-payment after acceleration in the same manner that it rebates upon voluntary pre-payment, no default charges are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.399" offset="1912978">And it is clear from the record in this case that practice is followed in these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.778" offset="1966477">Therefore that the Petitioner's forms in these cases comply with the provisions of the Act and the regulation as interpreted by the Federal Reserve Board in its official staff interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.188" offset="2004093">This, incidentally, is the position that the United States has been taken in its brief filed by the invitation of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.426" offset="2037112">I would like to point out on (b)(7) that the official staff interpretation with respect to (b)(7) is that a creditor need only disclose its rebate practices in general; it need not disclose what its rebate practice is.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.157" offset="2091969">And by specifically spelling out acceleration, as long as it makes a general rebate disclosure of its rebate agreement with respect to pre-payment, that is sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.466" offset="2197191">The decisions of this Court have consistently held that an agency interpretation of its own regulation which is what is involved here, should be deferred to as long as it is not plainly erroneous, or as long as there are no compelling indications there.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.155" offset="2256018">The agency's interpretation of its own regulation did not give the only possible construction of the legislation, nor what even a court might consider to be the principal construction, as long as it is plainly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.589" offset="2301680">We also submit that acceptance of the OSI in this case will further substantial policy considerations and will promote and facilitate the single most important purpose of the Truth In Lending Act, and that is to facilitate comparison shopping by consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.413" offset="2361031">How will it do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="565.832" offset="2366673">It will do it because it will facilitate comparison shopping for credit because disclosures can at last be uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.339" offset="2388720">If responsibility here is placed with a central agency, here the Federal Reserve Board, rather than among scattered among appellate trial courts across the land, it will also facilitate comparison shopping to credit because disclosures can be made simple and shorter and uniform and more understandable to the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.880" offset="2470849">Once creditors realize that they can place a high degree of reliance upon the board and staff interpretations of their own regulations, they will no longer feel compelled to provide the lengthy and complex disclosure forms that are now provided in an effort to anticipate and fend off litigation of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.817" offset="2542634">Respondents in their brief have urged this Court to amend the staff interpretation and to equate acceleration with pre-payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.985" offset="2583280">That this amendments implies, they claim that under (b)(7) the creditor must disclosure whether it rebates finance charged upon acceleration.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.413" offset="2617031">The first problem in this argument is that acceleration and pre-payment are distinct concepts, they are not the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.983" offset="2643257">They are logically and legally antithetical and so raises a demand for payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.864" offset="2662797">It is not in any senses of the word a pre-payment as claimed by the Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.768" offset="2682441">Respondents have not cited any provision of the Act or the regulation or any other authority, for that matter, to support their argument that acceleration and pre-payment are identical.</text>

            <text syncTime="752.550" offset="3113566">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.151" offset="3124015">I don't want to repeat what Mr. Burke has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.631" offset="3141883">I think that he [ILLEGIBLE WORDS] case on the statute under Regulation 3 for the correctness of the Board's official staff interpretation FC-0054 which is set forth at pages 52 through 56 of the Appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.545" offset="3225579">If, as we submit, the Board concludes that this official staff interpretation of the Board has correctly construed the Act and Regulation Z with respect to the disclosure of acceleration clauses and the rebate policy on payment of unearned finance charges upon payment after acceleration, I think it is clear that the judgment below has to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.040" offset="3323486">What I would like to describe briefly for the Court, it is set forth in greater detail in Petitioners' reply brief in the Appendix to his reply brief, is the process pursuant to which official staff interpretations are issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.330" offset="3408645">The Court in the Mourning case has indicated that where reasonable minds may differ as to which of several remedial methods should be chosen, the Court should defer to the informed judgement of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.275" offset="3472488">And here the agency that Congress has vested authority to promulgate rules and regulations is the Federal Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.603" offset="3501746">The part of the Federal Reserve Board that deals with the Truth In Lending Act is the office of Consumer Affairs of the Federal Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.542" offset="3537586">And these official staff interpretations are the product of a specialized group of people within the staff of the Board which are expert in the area of consumer credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.775" offset="3598503">We think that is why they ought to be entitled to great deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.543" offset="3617520">To begin with, let me say at the outset before I begin to describe the process, that Congress itself has recognized that official staff interpretations of the Board are such that they ought to be given deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.381" offset="3680946">In 1974 Congress amended the Truth In Lending Act to provide for civil and criminal immunity if a person acts in good faith, relies upon the Board's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.399" offset="3732982">But two years later Congress determined that good faith reliance on the Board's interpretation was insufficient and they extended the immunity to good faith conformity with any interpretation or approval by a duly authorized official or employee of the Federal Reserve System.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.614" offset="3805811">In our view, this 1976 amendment demonstrates a congressional vote of confidence in the quality and reliability these official staff interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.095" offset="3847711">And the process which is set forth in the appendix to the Petitioner's reply brief we think confirms the correctness of this congressional vote of confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.946" offset="3887208">Official staff interpretation are issued in response to inquires by private parties, either debtors or creditors, to the Federal Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.939" offset="3935169">And when the inquiry comes in the matter is assigned to a staff attorney to prepare a draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.251" offset="3964426">And the reason I am going into this in great detail is because the other side has characterized these official staff interpretations as the work of a lone attorney or a lone Board employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.061" offset="4019597">And really nothing could be further from the truth, because the draft is prepared by a lone person but then the process involves a very deep and detailed consultation with other staff attorneys, section chiefs and officials of the Consumer Affairs Office of the Federal Reserve System.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.319" offset="4100681">After the matter is then discussed with various officials who have demonstrated familiarity with the particular problem and the official staff interpretation is only issued after further review by a section chief and approval by two officials of the Consumer Affairs Office of the Federal Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.291" offset="4188557">Now, this is not the end of the matter, because then the official staff interpretation is sent to the Federal Register for publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.570" offset="4221680">And in 1977, when this official staff interpretation -- the one at issue here -- was promulgated, the Board then had a practice of issuing some OSI's with immediately effective dates and some with delayed effective dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.002" offset="4303391">But the implication was the same and that is the public was entitled to make comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.811" offset="4334634">By "the public," I mean not only the community of consumers but the banking community and the people who lend in the consumer credit area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.146" offset="4371937">This particular OSI was issued with an immediate effective date but there was a provision, as I said, for reconsideration upon request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.700" offset="4410180">There was no request for reconsideration of this OSI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.455" offset="4425226">Now, all OSI's were then and now reviewed quarterly by a Consumer Affairs Committee which is a committee of members of the Federal Reserve Board itself who have been assigned oversight responsibility over the work of the Office of Consumer Affairs -- I think it is called Community Consumer Affairs now -- of the Federal Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.000" offset="4527417">Now, as of April 19, 1978 the Board amended its procedure to provide for a delayed effective date of 30 days with respect to all official staff interpretations and a period of public comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.547" offset="4589589">And the period of public comment useful to provide the Board with input from people who are affected by these technical interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.659" offset="4630026">Between August 1976 and April 1978, 147 OSO's were issued under Regulation Z.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.850" offset="4666807">Six were reconsidered pursuant to request and none were changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.240" offset="4684361">Under the new procedure where everything gets a delayed effective date, 20 official staff interpretations have been issued, nine have been considered, and again, none have been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.771" offset="4734412">The point that we think is important here for the Court is that this entire process is marked by very careful consideration and it is the product of the special expertise of a group of highly trained people who have demonstrated deep familiarity with the consumer credit field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.262" offset="4816436">And it is important that these official staff interpretations receive deference, because as counsel for the Petitioner has properly pointed out, these technical questions require authoritative answers by a central authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.265" offset="4880384">And indeed the disarray in this case is indicative of the problems that arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.275" offset="4904521">We now have five or six different circuits who have expressed themselves on the question of pre-payment under the finance disclosure charge policy and each have indicated slightly different ways that they would go about providing for this disclosure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1257.643" offset="5133981">But I think that if this Court holds as we submit it should that official staff interpretations are entitled to deference, I think a lot of kind of litigation over very small questions under the Act, small disclosure questions will cease because I think the statistics in the briefs have indicated that the volume of Truth In Lending litigations has mushroomed enormously as people have challenged the propriety of a variety questions of disclosure under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1303.115" offset="5315793">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.273" offset="5320495">My understanding is they generally have followed them and this case I think is an unusual instance where there has been a wide variety of judicial rule-making in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.075" offset="5383711">But I think, as our brief points out, generally they have been give the deference that we think they deserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.750" offset="5410356">And what I want to say in closing is simply that this judicial disarray has in our view hampered enforcement by the various agencies that are given the enforcement powers under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.554" offset="5469602">Because while private debtors or consumers can bring actions under the Act, a variety of agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, the Comptroller of the Currency -- they are all set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1507 -- have been given responsibility by Congress according to the kind of creditor to enforce the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.037" offset="5579525">Now, these agencies necessarily have to look to and rely upon the official staff interpretations of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.941" offset="5611186">And if they can't do that, then I think that the uniformity Congress sought to impose in this area will be severely hampered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.865" offset="5854856">-- and Nine Donna Barren -- these were two separate transactions -- who purchased, their automobiles from Ford Near Credit Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.734" offset="5878262">I would like to add just one additional fact that was not brought out by the Petitioner and that is the Milhollin's were payments late on their contract, when without prior notice Ford Motor Credit repossessed their automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.403" offset="5928939">On the sane day as the repossession, the Milhollin's offered to pay Ford Motor the exact amount of the delinquent payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.051" offset="5955584">In fact Ford Motor denied this and indicated that they accelerated the unpaid balance and they demanded the entire unpaid balance of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.721" offset="5990275">There are three points which I would like to make to the Court this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.395" offset="6004903">First, all the parties concerned, the Federal Reserve Board staff, the Solicitor General, the consumers and Ford Motor Credit agree that in a contract like the one signed by the consumers in this case, the effect on the finance charge of the process of acceleration is important information to be disclosed to the consumers under the provisions of the Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.439" offset="6101138">Second, the consumers could prevail in this case under either the views expressed by the Federal Reserve Board staff or the rationale of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.576" offset="6141680">We think that the lower court's opinion is the better rule since, unlike the views of the Federal Reserve Board staff, it consistently guarantees the disclosure of meaningful information to the consumer in all credit transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.115" offset="6191835">And third, the Federal Reserve Board itself has not made known its position on this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1528.145" offset="6215973">Mr. Slottee, I don't mean to get anecdotal about this but supposing you have the most consumer-oriented court or Board in the world and it is trying to figure out what has to be disclosed and what hasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.999" offset="6279398">I can remember a committee I served on drafting a Truth in Land Sales Act and we were following a model of a State which had a three-page list of requirements that had to be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.143" offset="6335927">One of them, a particular disclosure was that during periods of high water all or parts of this lot may be under water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.778" offset="6378454">It didn't prevent the lot from selling at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.628" offset="6393919">Whereas, had it been limited to just a few very important things it might have prevented the lot from selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.416" offset="6429027">I would think that from a consumer's point of view you would want a limited, but important, category of information disclosed; and not just every conceivable thing you can think of.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.312" offset="6532577">The first is -- and if you will look at the Joint Appendix pages 9 and 10 -- the majority of the provisions on a contract are not those required by the Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z. Rather, there are terms that are inserted by the creditors themselves, and is those extra terms that are the terms that are causing the contracts to become longer and more confusing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.681" offset="6674056">In this case the Petitioners could have remedied the violation by simply adding two words to their disclosure which would have given the meaningful information to the consumer that they needed prior to entering the contract to be able to judge the effect on the credit and the cost of credit, should default to the contract be accelerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.864" offset="6766843">The Solicitor General has stated several times in his brief that the Federal Reserve Board has in fact issued an official interpretation on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.226" offset="6796309">And to this extent the Solicitor General is mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.191" offset="6808116">The only interpretation that has been issued is an official staff interpretation and there have been three unofficial staff opinions that have been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.520" offset="6845419">But there has been no award interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.088" offset="6855764">And this is in fact the reason that the confusion among the circuits and the various disarray in the circuits has been created, is the Federal Reserve Board, granted as the agency authorized by Congress to implement the Truth In Lending Act, has failed to issue an interpretation which will solve the confusion which will answer the questions which will tell consumers and creditors alike what disclosures have to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.185" offset="6960149">In that situation, it is natural that the courts have stepped in, taken over for the Federal Reserve Board itself, and tried to remedy the situation; and they have come up with six or seven different theories.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.585" offset="7049697">You have got the Ninth Circuit position, which didn't follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.120" offset="7059832">You had several other circuits which followed it completely and several others which said disclosures never have to be made about acceleration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.582" offset="7097657">I will explain the problem to you with the OSI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.954" offset="7111137">The Ninth Circuit and the Federal Reserve Board official interpretations basically agree that the process of acceleration can affect the cost of credit and that an early termination of the contract will affect the amount of the finance charge that is going to be rebated and that is information to be disclosed to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.562" offset="7193579">That is the basis of the official staff interpretation and that is the basis of the Ninth Circuit opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.499" offset="7217403">Where the two part company is on the situations when that disclosure has to be made to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.639" offset="7253974">The Federal Reserve Board staff is concerned with the affect on the consumer of acceleration, whereas the Ninth Circuit is concerned with the information that will be given to the consumer about acceleration and its affect on the finance charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.262" offset="7312384">And I think a good example is represented by 54.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.145" offset="7335999">One of the purposes of the Truth In Lending Act -- and it was indicated by the Petitioner -- is to promote comparative credit shopping by consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.891" offset="7370898">Now, if you take official staff interpretation 54 and apply it to a common situation with two creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.079" offset="7399737">The consumer is going out and trying to shop for credit, to decide which is going to be the best credit deal for that consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.228" offset="7428263">If these two creditors rebate upon acceleration by exactly the same method, but they differ as to pre-payment since that one creditor rebates by the same method in both situations and the other creditor differs, the first creditor will only have to disclose the pre-payment method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.517" offset="7513422">The second creditor will have to disclose both the pre-payment method and the method for acceleration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.112" offset="7535783">The consumer will look at those contracts and, despite the fact that both creditors rebate upon acceleration by the same method, will see only one rebate disclosure for acceleration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.496" offset="7577370">The consumer would reasonably believe that the first creditor has a better deal for him, or her, because there is no indication about any finance charge rebate or lack thereof on acceleration, and there is no way the consumer could reasonably meaningfully comparative shop in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2256.849" offset="9130820">The second problem with staff interpretation 54 is it doesn't answer the question of what to do when the contract has a pre-payment disclosure on the front and an acceleration clause on the back that says that the creditor has the right to accelerate the unpaid balance but does not disclose the method by which that rebate for the finance charge will remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.992" offset="9219323">And what the staff has said in this situation is you look to undisclosed non-binding creditor policy to determine what in fact the creditor will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.602" offset="9261746">You basically say what is the policy of the creditor; if the policy of the creditor, regardless of the contract term, is to rebate the same as for pre-payment, then no disclosure has to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.281" offset="9308453">If the policy of the creditor is to rebate for other than pre-payment, then they have to make a separate disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.397" offset="9336978">And there are numerous problems of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.323" offset="9344711">The first is - How is the consumer, the person whom the Act is intended to protect, going to be able to determine what the undisclosed policy of the creditor is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.285" offset="9388492">Second, that policy is not binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.899" offset="9403016">It is a non-written, undisclosed policy, it is not binding on the creditor and it is not binding on the creditor's assignee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.099" offset="9435721">And that in fact frustrates the enforcement mechanism of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.757" offset="9450350">It was indicated by the Solicitor General private consumers are in fact a primary enforcement mechanism of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.398" offset="9480965">Since acceleration or rebate of the finance charge is not going to occur until there is a default, and that is when the policy of the creditor will in fact become known, that default may incur after a year; and the Act has a one-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.469" offset="9549197">And if it occurs after the year, the consumer is simply not going to have any remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.909" offset="9562990">The creditor, who has a non-binding policy, in fact is going to be able to change that policy however they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.886" offset="9590888">The record in this case indicates that Ford Motor changed their policy twice, in the Milhollin case and in the Eaton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.279" offset="9620459">But the contract disclosures state exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.693" offset="9634147">In the first case, the affidavit indicated that upon the act of acceleration they rebated according to pre-payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.036" offset="9843545">It is not in the record now, but we deal with a lot of these contracts and I think the normal rule now is to have the acceleration clause on the front of the contract rather than on the back.</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.088" offset="11707747">The Mourning opinion had to do with the authority of the Federal Reserve Board to issue a regulation and whether they had that authority under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.530" offset="11741497">And that is not the case here, we are talking about something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.270" offset="11752469">We are not attacking the authority of the Federal Reserve Board to issue 226.8(b)(7) or 226.8(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.976" offset="11783293">We think that 8(b)(7) is perfectly proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.077" offset="11791653">What we are questioning is the details of the application of the staff's interpretation of that particular regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.278" offset="11840449">I would just like to say one other thing in closing, and that is it has been indicated that there have been a lot of Truth in Lending suits filed in the United States and that the number is significantly increasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.742" offset="11886320">And the implication, though it hasn't been said directly, is that a number of these suits are frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.140" offset="11903979">I have several comments to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.258" offset="11912443">First, there is nothing in the record and there is no citation in any cases that I know of that says anything that these increased Truth in Lending suits are in fact frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.641" offset="11945984">In fact, I think what they may represent is the increase in consumer credit in the United States and the lack of creditor compliance with the terms of Truth in Lending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.928" offset="11991124">And I would also mention something that this Court stated just several months ago in Ryder v. Sonotone which authorized private class actions under the Antitrust Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.992" offset="12031352">That same concern was raised by Sonotone in that case and the Court said basically that is not an unimportant consideration but District Courts should be aware and vigilant for frivolous suits, but it is up to Congress to provide adequate funds for judges to handle the Truth in Lending suits or to handle the suits that may arise under the Anti-trust Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.217" offset="12124244">I think the heart of the situation is not the deference to be accorded to the staff opinions but whether or not in the application of these opinions the consumer is going to receive the meaningful information that they are entitled to under the terms of the Act and under the statements of this Court in Mourning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3030.838" offset="12226748">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.479" offset="12237302">I won't take much more of the Court's time to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.132" offset="12247855">I would like to address a couple of points that were raised by Mr. Slottee in his presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.545" offset="12269589">First of all, I do not want the Court left with the impression that the Respondents were mistreated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.940" offset="12295084">The Joint Appendix at pages 23 to 25 indicate the substantial efforts made by Ford to cause the Milhollin's to bring their contract current, which failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.419" offset="12329044">Mrs. Eaton advised Ford that she could no longer continue to make payments on the contract, so Ford accepted the vehicle in full discharge of the indebtedness and did not seek a deficiency judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.663" offset="12370004">In response to the questions by Mr. Justice Stevens, Mr. Slottee has said that the simple addition of two words would solve this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.347" offset="12404799">The words were that you disclose that you will rebate upon pre-payment or acceleration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.842" offset="12426742">Had we added those two simple words that Mr. Slottee says would have solved all the problems, we would be here today with Mr. Slottee arguing that you don't rebate upon acceleration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.417" offset="12465089">You have mis-advised the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.128" offset="12471881">You say you will rebate upon pre-payment or acceleration, your own affidavits show that you don't rebate on acceleration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.068" offset="12495600">You rebate upon payment following acceleration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.791" offset="12506572">And we would be litigating that question here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.928" offset="12519111">There has been no change in Ford Credit's policy on rebate, as the Joint Appendix shows at pages 22 and 68.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.316" offset="12552652">I would like to conclude by emphasizing the terrible dilemma facing the credit industry today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.315" offset="12580655">The dilemma is the central theme of the three amicus curiae briefs filed by the Consumer Bankers Association, the California Bankers Association, the National Consumer Finance Association, joined by General Motors Acceptance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.247" offset="12632377">And that dilemma is the consumer credit industry wants to comply with the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z and it is conscientiously attempting to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.099" offset="12663724">However, the problem is the industry can't place any substantial degree of reliance upon the Board and staff interpretations if courts such as the court below refuse to pay deference to those interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.133" offset="12715865">The industry can't afford to change their contract forms each time a new case comes down with an additional disclosure that that particular judge thought should be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.352" offset="12748779">And at the same time they can't afford not to change their forms because of the punitive liability aspects of the Act which could be ruinous to small creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.130" offset="12783888">As a result, what they are doing is the logical thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.977" offset="12795277">They are over-disclosing in an attempt to anticipate and fond off legal challenges of the type raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.905" offset="12827042">The result is that the disclosure forms are long -- I have seen forms that are two or three feet long -- they are confusing, they are non-uniform, and that itself is a violation, or could be a violation of the Act and the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.637" offset="12873958">We submit that there is a simple way out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.320" offset="12884616">And that is if the official staff interpretation is followed and applied in this case, it will have two healthy effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.961" offset="12911261">First, the Board will be encouraged to continue to use its interpretive powers to attempt to bring some semblance of uniformity and simplicity into this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.490" offset="12949295">This will benefit creditors, to be sure; but it will also benefit consumers, because the forms can be shorter and simpler and easier to understand, if creditors know that they can place reliance upon the Board's interpretive guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.044" offset="13003525">The second beneficial effect of following the OSI in this case is it will permit the system to operate the way Congress and the Board intended it to operate, and that is when the Board or the staff publishes an OSI for comment in the Federal Register, creditors, consumers, any interested person will make their views known to the Board at that time rather than to wait until subsequent litigation to attack the Board's views.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.104" offset="13099760">The Board and staff can then assess the views and positions of all interested parties at that time, which will vastly improve its decision-making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.217" offset="13136227">In short, it will no longer be possible for an interest group or a person to sit back, allow an OSI to be published for comment, allow it to become final, allow the industry to rely upon it, and then attack it in a trial court action, attempting to convince a trial judge that the Board could have done better, as was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.225" offset="13208221">We submit therefore, for all of these reasons, that the decision of the court below should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.702" offset="13226193">Thank you very much.</text>
