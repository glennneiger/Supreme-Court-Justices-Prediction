            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="57.835" offset="334764">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.165" offset="348035">This case is here from the judgment of the Court of Claims on the petition of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.225" offset="376247">In that court, the plaintiffs were, first, some 1500 Indian allottees on association consisting of those allottees and perhaps others and the Quinault Tribe, itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.755" offset="450435">The case concerns the management of timber on the Quinault Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.091" offset="479692">That reservation was created in 1873 by a presidential order.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.171" offset="508008">It was provided for some 20 years earlier by a treaty leaving the location and dimensions of the reservation to be determined by the President at some later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.611" offset="561821">The reservation consists of some 200,000 acres of land mostly covered by timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.345" offset="596720">Some one-third of that area has now been taken out of trust, but the remainder in the land, we are told, involved in this case, is some 130,000 acres of timberland.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.111" offset="663803">Because the land was overgrown with timber, it was originally thought that it was not appropriate for allotment into individual parcels.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.977" offset="711241">But -- and indeed, that was the administrative view until this Court set the matter right in 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.562" offset="753664">During the decade that followed this Court's decision in Payne in 1924 and until 1933 or 1934 or 1935, most of these reservation was allotted in individual parcels or indeed, perhaps, all of it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.106" offset="839764">Typically, there were 80-acre allotments and we're told some 2000 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.498" offset="877380">The tribal interest here is derivative in that since the Indian Reorganization Act, some small portion of the allotted lands have returned in the tribal ownership, but a mere 4000 acres as compared to the very much larger portion in individual allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.120" offset="971839">Beginning in 1910, the Secretary of the Interior was given statutory authority to consent to the sale of timber on Indian-allotted land, as well as on Indian tribal land.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.056" offset="1027636">And whether or not, those allotted lands were technically held in trust or were held by some restricted patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.536" offset="1069537">In 1934, as a part of the Indian Reorganization Act, the Secretary was required when managing Indian timberlands to do so, on a sustained-yield basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.228" offset="1132335">These plaintiffs brought this action in the Court of Claims alleging a number of complaints against the Secretary's management of their timberlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.021" offset="1179460">They said that he had failed to obtain a fair market value in the sales contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.566" offset="1205687">That he had failed to manage it on sustained-yield basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.024" offset="1223450">That he failed, in some cases, to obtain any payment for the timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.590" offset="1241736">That he'd not developed the proper system of roads and that he'd made improper charges against the allottees for some of those roadworks.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.598" offset="1281755">That he'd fail to pay interest on certain sums or insufficient interest and finally that he had exacted excessive administrative charges of being cleared that the Secretary's entitled to make a charge for his management of the timber but the allottees claimed the actual charges were excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.516" offset="1365452">In all of these respects of course, the allottees claimed money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.861" offset="1394813">It's fair to say that the case proceeded for some years in the Court of Claims before the United States interposed the defense which is presently before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.748" offset="1446327">That defense, the motion to dismiss was premised on the notion that these claims were monetary relief against the United States in respect of its management of the timber, did not lie under the Tucker Act or under its counterpart Section 1505 of the Judicial Code, in the Court of Claims or indeed in any other Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.019" offset="1555414">That defense was no doubt accounted by this Court's decision in United States v. Testan in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.444" offset="1601181">At all events, when the motion came before the Court of Claims, that Court overruled it holding that applying the rationale of Testan and its own decisions, the United States here through its agent, the Secretary of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, had violated statutory duties which fairly mandated compensation in damages under the Tucker Act or under Section 1505 against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.628" offset="1749870">It is that ruling against which we complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.823" offset="1774634">The case is primarily one under the Tucker Act, Section 1491 of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.988" offset="1807339">Much is made of the companion provision as we call it, Section 1505, which pertains however, only to the claims of Indian tribes or identifiable groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.707" offset="1862196">Here the great majority of the plaintiffs or individual allottees who cannot, whenever you make any claim, except under the Tucker Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.496" offset="1909321">And indeed the Court of Claims did not suggest otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.463" offset="1925204">1505 was in the case, in view of the Court of Claims simply because there is a small tribal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.128" offset="1959894">At all events, as we've elaborated in our brief, the two statutory provisions are entirely quite extensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.559" offset="1993644">1505 allows no more monetary relief than does the Tucker Act, itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="493.020" offset="2075460">First of all is there a private right of action created and secondly, if so, as the answer -- if the answer to that is, yes, does the defendant have sovereign immunity?</text>

            <text syncTime="2312.923" offset="9355055">And I would like to refresh ourselves on the language of that Act, the part that's relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.840" offset="9382745">25 U.S.C. 348 which was passed in 1887 says, “The United States does and will hold the land thus allotted for the period of 25 years in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotment shall have been made or in case of his decease, of his heirs, according to the laws of the state or territory where such land is located.</text>

            <text syncTime="2361.398" offset="9548988">In the Capoeman case this Court held that that language created a trust that had an important purpose of bringing the Indian to a state of competency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2451.758" offset="9910418">Therefore, this -- the 1910 Act certainly superseded the General Allotment Act's ban on any contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.164" offset="9944064">But to pick up with the Capoeman case again, in that case you held that the language of the General Allotment Act created an undertaking to hold whole for the Indian his allotment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2482.809" offset="10034657">And I would ask you, if you hold that the trust allotment cannot be diminished by taxes during the trust period, does it not follow that it should not be diminished by waste by the trustee during the trust period?</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.995" offset="10107382">The intent of Congress certainly had to be the same in both cases that would diminish the value of the allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.420" offset="10157014">And the Government has argued that the General Allotment Act did not contemplate a complex timber management operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.651" offset="12142007">This is this Court laying down the rule, “Entitlement to money damages depends upon whether any federal statute, ‘can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government, for the damage sustained,' citing Eastport.</text>

            <text syncTime="3586.756" offset="14450395">Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, I simply want to suggest that the proposition now put forward is a novel one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.577" offset="14481638">In one respect in this case, it seems to be a -- accolade of Indian cases, but we know from the Cherry case, decided by the same Court subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.366" offset="14524792">That this notion, that there is immunability to damages for breach of trust is not limited to Indian cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.787" offset="14554572">And indeed, why should it be here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.625" offset="14561886">There is such a principle, it will range far and wide and we invite the Court not to open that door which, if it's opened, has been opened since 1887 and yet, it didn't occur to anyone, Indian or not Indian to put it forward until at the earliest, a decade ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="3638.365" offset="14656867">We recently construed the Sherman Act to include the type of cause of action that -- that's not been thought of by anybody since 1881 or 1887 or whenever the Act was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3652.029" offset="14711515">But Mr. Chief Justice, it happens, but it is unusual to discover 100 years later that the Tucker Act, if they're available, has and open to individual Indians, not tribes since then, has now, for the first time, provided a remedy of breach of trust because it happens, it might not have, that the allotment in this case was under the General Allotment Act, if it have been made under the very Treaty of Olympia involved in this case, it would not be a trust allotment, it would be a restricted allotment.</text>
