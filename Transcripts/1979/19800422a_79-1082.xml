            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="26.915" offset="211048">In this case, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside the Decisions and Orders of the National Labor Relations Board in two separate cases which are the most recent in a series of Board Decisions dealing with the validity under the Anti-boycotting Provisions of the National Labor Relations Act of various provisions and applications of the Rules on Containers which are in the East Coast labor contract between the Respondent Union and the shipping companies governs major ports on the East Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.488" offset="397354">The Board Decisions, in our view, represent a consistent pattern of factual findings, inferences, and conclusions; and prior to the Decision in this Case, the Board Decisions had been upheld by three Courts of Appeals in various applications; and indeed, this Court had denied certiorari in one of those cases, the Conex case, a leading case, that the Second Circuit Court of Appeals had decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.943" offset="539146">The Court below, in our view, drew different factual inferences from the Board; and on the basis of those inferences, rejected its conclusions thereby resulting in a conflict in the Circuits which requires resolution by late spring or early summer if the negotiations for the new labor contract are to proceed since we now have conflicting views expressed by the Courts of Appeals with respect to the Rules on Containers in cases that indeed involved the same Rules as applied to the Port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.096" offset="739767">The particular incidents that led to the refusals to deal at issue here involved the consolidation of less than container load cargo into containers by freight forwarders in the Port of New York and so-called shortstopping, which was the stripping of containers as the unloading is called, that were full shipper's load incoming cargo, that were stripped by truckers in Baltimore and Hampton Roads port areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.300" offset="924609">In both instances these incidents were performed within 50 miles of the port, and the essence of the Rules on Containers in the collective agreement, as here pertinent, is an attempt to reserve to the members of the responding union all stuffing and stripping of containers within 50 miles of the port; either by requiring duplication of the work or by imposing prohibitive fines found by the Board in this case to have the effect of requiring a boycott or by the explicit requirement of the refusal to deal with the offending companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.706" offset="1122200">And the essence of the Board's holding is that in this respect the Rules overreach; go beyond work preservation to an attempt to acquire work that had traditionally been performed by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.427" offset="1209031">The distinction between primary and secondary activity that has been drawn by this Court in the National Woodwork and Pipefitters cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.714" offset="1254275">As the Board viewed what had occurred here, the Respondent union was attempting to compensate for the increase in productivity caused by containerization and for the reduction in manhours therefore required on the docks by attempting to take away work traditionally done by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.398" offset="1376946">In essence, the Board's findings are that there have traditionally been two markets performing related but separate functions, depending on which market the shipper chose to utilize.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.509" offset="1449357">In some instances, the shipper would send goods directly to the pier loosely to be handled by the longshoremen and loaded or unloaded that way and picked up at the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.096" offset="1523754">In many other instances, they worked both prior to and since containerization through what had been known as freight forwarders or freight agents whose function was to sort and consolidate cargo to provide for its expedition, to provide for its sequential handling at the pier, which would result in faster loading, less time that it would be subject to damage or assessed on the pier; and sequential unloading at the port of its destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.837" offset="1702745">And there had indeed been an evolution of the use of containers which we've recounted in some detail in our Reply Brief prior to the use of containerized ships which has been the big advance in technology and which has to a large extent, made the old cargo method of loading and unloading ships obsolete.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.992" offset="1847359">And all during this evolutionary process and indeed in the early years of the use of container ships, the same breakdown in work functions has existed and been carried forward until the response in these Rules on Containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.281" offset="1948505">Something of this background and traditions of functional differentiation in the industry will be elaborated by Mr. Lips who will be arguing next.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.757" offset="2018408">Now, as the Board viewed the case, and as we view it now, of course, it would be permissible for the Respondent union to seek to preserve the aspect of the work they have traditionally performed the on-pier stuffing and stripping of containers on behalf of shippers who choose to deliver their cargo without the services of these middlemen, the consolidators or freight forwarders.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.563" offset="2165635">They would have a right to take action against their employers if the employers were to subcontract the work that they had traditionally done on the pier, they might also seek to induce their employers to take measures to attract more business in this way by perhaps having the steamship companies make available, if they saw fit to, trucks to carry the goods to the pier and schedule the on-pier loading of containers in a way that would attract more of the business to the area where the Respondent union has traditionally done their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.927" offset="2363120">But the Rules on Containers go considerably beyond this kind of measured and proper response under the Labor Act and include, at least as an object which is enough under Section 8(b)(4) and under the Court's Decision in Pipefitters, the acquisition of the areas of work that have traditionally been performed by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.002" offset="2483388">They are, at least within the 50-mile zone, an effort to say that only the on-pier work can use the new technology; and those that have traditionally engaged in the off-pier practices must be denied the benefits of the new technology.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="615.050" offset="2563532">As I read the Majority Opinion of the Court of Appeals, and I believe it was Judge Robb's Dissenting Opinion here, where he said that if a container is part of a whole -- a very large crate would have to be part of a whole, too -- I had the feeling that one would have to know the business pretty well to make a judgment on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.245" offset="2660394">And I had thought that that was a matter that was pretty much left to the Board subject to review by the Courts of Appeals for abusive discretion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="652.255" offset="2712430">Well, I couldn't agree more with that suggestion, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.356" offset="2732805">The Board has heard extensive evidence about this industry in case after case and necessarily has more cumulative information about the background of this industry and the practices than any reviewing Court of Appeals has been favored with and has drawn its inferences accordingly in what we believe to be a consistent pattern of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.357" offset="2836773">And with proper deference to the factual inferences drawn by the Board, there would have been a consistent pattern of Court of Appeals Decisions and really no need for this Court to be drawn into the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.849" offset="2894764">But there're only the two places where uniformity of result can be expected the Board or this Court, in the circumstances here.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="711.464" offset="2949204">Only because there's only one of each.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="713.907" stopTime="892.451">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="713.907" offset="2959026">That is correct, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.283" offset="2980551">There are times when the Board's pattern of decisions may not be as consistent as it has been in this particular area, but here there has been a consistent pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.952" offset="3027153">And I do think the Court of Appeals erred in faulting the Board for ignoring the precontainerization work traditions of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.246" offset="3080338">The Board's Opinions refer quite specifically to the precontainerization background.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.811" offset="3118582">We have set out on page 20, and also on pages 21 and 22, of our Brief, some excerpts from, first, the Conex Opinion on which the Board specifically relied in the New York case before the Court now, in which it talks, at the beginning of the second paragraph on page 20, about the precontainerization background; and then in the second sentence, that the advent of containerization didn't change this.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.612" offset="3229863">The same thing is true of the Administrative Law Judges Opinion adopted by the Board in the Hampton Roads case that is also before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.742" offset="3290363">First, at the bottom of page 21, there is discussion of the precontainerization background; and at the top of page 22, the advent of containerization did not change this.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.005" offset="3335398">So the Board having found the work traditions to be what they have been really was at the end of the case as far as they were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.782" offset="3378552">The case seemed to be ruled by principles this Court has established.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.193" offset="3396106">The Court of Appeals having rejected the Board's factual conclusions, went on to reach more specifically the interrelated question of right to control the work and whether the employer had the right to control the work that's in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.787" offset="3486490">And we believe the Court of Appeals erred in this respect as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.060" offset="3515643">The difference between this case and National Woodwork with respect to the right to control is that in National Woodwork, the employer had the unilateral choice whether to install the prefinished doors or whether to engage in his traditional practice; and this case much more closely resembles the Pipefitters case where customer choices were directing the employer's course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.961" offset="3643225">Here it's the shippers who are choosing to use the consolidation or deconsolidation services of the middlemen.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="892.451" offset="3673213">Mr. Wallace, you're telling us that the Court decided the right-to-control issue erroneously, or are you telling us that it was wrong to get into the issue at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="906.792" offset="3730578">Or both?</text>

            <text syncTime="907.437" offset="3733086">Well, I am telling you it was erroneously decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.652" offset="3745938">Perhaps it's an issue that the Court should have asked for the Board's views on initially, but the Board did brief the issue before the Court of Appeals and argue it because it seemed clear to counsel for the Board -- and we've briefed it in this Court -- that the case is controlled by Pipefitters.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="947.150" offset="3892015">Under Pipefitters, there wasn't a right to control, as we view the case; and therefore, this was an unlawful boycott even if the Court of Appeals disagreed with the Board's findings and factual inferences about the work traditions in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.185" offset="3964113">The Board didn't have to explicitly state anything about the right to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.948" offset="3983130">But the issues do have a close interrelationship, and we think Pipefitters governed it, and we told the Court of Appeals as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.119" offset="4015835">And in addition, there is a new wrinkle on right to control in this case, and that is that the Shipping Act and the Federal Maritime Commission interpretation of the Shipping Act make it clear that there is no right to control in the manner exercised by the Rules at issue here because the Rules amount to a discrimination between customers within the 50-mile zone and customers beyond the 50-mile zone of exactly the kind that the Shipping Act prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.319" offset="4164629">And curiously enough, in the Court of Appeals' Opinion which did not address the Shipping Act question, the Court relies very strongly in a footnote in its Opinion on the distinction between them within the 50-mile zone and those beyond the 50-mile zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.118" offset="4267865">The very violation of the Shipping Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.693" offset="4398164">While the fact is, were it not for the discrimination in violation of the Shipping Act, the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, likening the loading and unloading of containers to the loading and unloading of a ship's hold would permit Respondents to follow containers all over the country, and to insist on monopolization of the loading and unloading of containers anywhere in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1268.424" offset="5177031">The Rules in the application we are talking about now really threaten to eliminate the intermodal advantages of containers which can be affixed directly to a truck chassis and moved from there directly into the ship's hold and vice versa, and to eliminate the services of the off-pier indoor consolidation and deconsolidation business with the advantages of expedition and protection against damage and theft that experience has shown that they provide, and that has, in the market place, attracted a large share of the business to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.704" offset="5354141">And one further consideration bearing on these economic advantages is that in National Woodwork, both the Court and Mr. Justice Harlan in concurrence emphasized the lack of Congressional guidance in this area other than Congress's traditional reliance on the bargaining process and the hope that the problems of technological innovation will be worked out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.726" offset="5474304">There has been some change in this situation since the decision in National Woodwork.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.864" offset="6118797">But I certainly am not suggesting that the case be remanded to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.454" offset="6141158">I think resolution of the case is very important to labor peace in the East Coast ports and the ability to negotiate the new contracts this summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.506" offset="6189432">And that was the basis of our expedited petition to this Court very shortly after the Court of Appeals denied rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.736" offset="6234363">So this statute, as well as the other reasons I have suggested, seem to us to indicate that the Court should uphold the Board's determination that Congress did not intend the answer to containerization to be a boycott agreement adopted at a bargaining table at which many of those most profoundly affected, the shippers, the truckers, the consolidators, and deconsolidators, and all of their employees, were not represented.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.712" offset="6470196">The work in issue here is the loading and unloading of cargo to and from the containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.288" offset="6492557">And the only real question is whether or not the geographic location of that work, when it's done, is work that is traditionally within the jurisdiction of the ILA or, in this case, the truckers and the land-related transportation industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.768" offset="6562461">The record is complete in this and other cases that containers per se, that is, large boxes have been used for years, since before World War II, in and out of the ports on the East Coast covered by these Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.168" offset="6624005">And for years, the ILA never took the position that this was their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.049" offset="6643545">They passed these containers through frequently; both by those shipped by consolidators or the principals in this case for Dolphin Forwarding Company were called nonvessel operating common carriers.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Alan Lips</label>
            <text syncTime="1653.970" offset="6719300">It most certainly has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.492" offset="6725360">But the question becomes at what point could or should have the ILA said "this is our work."</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.229" offset="6756289">They certainly weren't ignorant of containers that passed through the ports, and they let them through for years without claiming this work which, to us, suggests very strongly that they didn't consider this their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.181" offset="6804146">Traditionally, non-vessel operating common carriers solicited their own customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.214" offset="6828178">They shipped their own goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.375" offset="6836851">They issued the bills of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.126" offset="6843852">They were responsible for the movement, not only from the time it left their facility across the land, but across the sea, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.513" offset="6877393">So they were the shipper, as it were; and they assumed responsibility for the packaging of the container; and this was historically done for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.489" offset="6917308">It's only when the container became so efficient that it began to eliminate the work of longshoremen on the piers that the longshoremen looked for a way to replace that work; and the way they seized was to replace it with work that was somebody else's work; by bringing it back on the piers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.401" offset="6996929">Now, the truckers on the import side had traditionally done the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.661" offset="7014066">In Hampton Roads and Baltimore, even after the modern container came into use there around the mid-60's or '65 or a little bit before, it wasn't for three more years in those ports that the ILA claimed that that was their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.843" offset="7090761">Of course, it wasn't their work because the truckers had been doing it with the modern containers as well as the old containers for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.332" offset="7120750">The ILA's chief argument in this case is a very simplistic one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.681" offset="7146141">It simply says we will draw an arbitrary 50-mile line; and within that line, all work that relates to containers is our work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.889" offset="7182921">And it can just as easily be done on the pier as it can out in the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.631" offset="7201938">Or the freight station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.792" offset="7206536">Or the consolidation station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.650" offset="7213955">It can just as easily be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.977" offset="7223254">Therefore, we think these are surrogate piers established for the purpose of avoiding longshore rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.266" offset="7252407">Well, they missed the question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.384" offset="7260871">That's too simplistic an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.744" offset="7270379">The fact is that the container system is a part of the intermodal transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.036" offset="7291486">It functions from point to point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.575" offset="7301622">It was designed to be that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.463" offset="7309249">It's new and different work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.894" offset="7314996">The Court of Appeals recognized it was new work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.122" offset="7323878">It said it was new work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.958" offset="7331192">The Court of Appeals simply said it believed that it should have the ability to rationalize the new work vis-a-vis the old work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.199" offset="7368182">Well, of course, it came to a different conclusion in its rationalization than the Labor Board did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.066" offset="7387617">But the work itself is new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.147" offset="7395976">The container is designed to go from point to point which is not necessarily from seaport to seaport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.202" offset="7420217">It's from the point at which the customer and the intermodal transportation system desire that the cargo be put in to and taken out of the container; and if it's limited to simply the port, from one pier to the next, then the container has no more function than the cargo net.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.741" offset="7502346">It's simply a metal box that lifts cargo up to the ship and takes it off again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.386" offset="7520946">The reason that the work is different and cannot be done on the pier is interrelated to why shippers use containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.881" offset="7566921">To understand that, you need to understand what an NVOCC does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.959" offset="7587192">When he brings the packages in, he is taking less-than-container load packages 5 packages from Cincinnati 10 from Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.422" offset="7621047">These are packages that the sea-carriers really can't handle anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.390" offset="7636929">They don't have the facilities to consolidate all of the many less-than-container load consolidations that go out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.992" offset="7663365">So the NVOCC pulls these things together, and he loads them in a sequential order in the container because he knows that when that container gets to its ultimate destination, those packages are going to be delivered to different spots.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.491" offset="13493373">There is no stopping of the containers if they belong to a consolidator a shipper, or anybody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="3386.056" offset="13647600">In fact, we had to amend the rules so that we asked the steamship companies to mark those containers that had to be stripped or not stripped.</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.149" offset="13991999">The problem was that the moment the carrier was able to take those containers and give them out to consolidators who were only people that, the record is clear, that only came into business after containerization, they would do it at substandard wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.797" offset="14050513">They would be working at three, four dollars an hour, and therefore, the automated carriers would be paying less contributions on the manhours going into the pension and welfare funds in the various ports; and therefore, put the conventional operator out of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.686" offset="14214144">Your honor, if its a shippers load or its a container that's owned by the consolidator if it's his container, then it goes right on the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.382" offset="14244864">Now, the problem you have with some of the steamship lines -- and this came out in the evidence -- is the fact that one of the consolidators came down with a 45-foot container and brought it down to the PRMMI, Puerto Rican.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.267" offset="14304423">Well, a 45-foot container cannot fit in a slot on a 30 -- where they use 35-foot containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.948" offset="14331173">So therefore, PRIMMI says look, we can't take your container.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.282" offset="14344547">The only way we can take your container is strip it and put it into 35-foot containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.002" offset="14363355">But basically, if that consolidator had a container, and it was two of the same containers, one was owned by the steamship company and one was owned by the consolidator and it was his container, and it was a roll-on, roll-off ship, they'd both go right on the ship without handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.457" offset="14441200">Now, the problem we have, and we restricted this only to those containers that were owned and leased.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.656" offset="14461994">Prior to containerization, Ford Motor Company which would bring down and pack in their own plant -- they have a consolidator -- pack great big cases with thousands of parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.315" offset="14504626">We permit those to go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.679" offset="14510059">It was always went through, and we still permit it to go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.474" offset="14521240">We don't have to do the packing of those containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.816" offset="14534614">In fact, in one of the cases mentioned in the brief filed by Tidewater Shipside Packing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.832" offset="14562722">In that particular case, Shipside was a subsidiary of one of the steamship companies under the contract, and they were packaging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.253" offset="14596368">And after we found out they were packaging and after the order, we submitted an affidavit to the Fourth Circuit saying that the rules did not apply, and it was a right decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.867" offset="14638791">But you've got to remember that we have one-million containers in the Port of New York comes to the port.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.983" offset="14663346">Now, when you have several containers that are not marked, certainly, we're going to have a problem with a couple, but in 1968 when we sat down -- and the record will show, and I think if you look at Exhibit No. 12, at page 464, which shows the manhours -- it was not until 1968, when the Rules and containers came in, that the workforce and the manhours started to decline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.350" offset="14772746">Because they had the Rules, and then automation went full start ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.934" offset="14795107">They went from 40 -- approximately, I think, in 1968 -- was approximately 44 million man-hours with approximately 27 thousand employees; and now, today, we have less than 20 million man-hours and we have less than 12 thousand employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.371" offset="14864906">Now, we have not impeded automation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.387" offset="14880893">We have not impeded progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.985" offset="14891342">In fact, the steamship companies have made billions of dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="4875.091" offset="19603728">They came in and they could add or decrease the cost of that minimum, depending on the amount of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.683" offset="19634134">But the service, again, of that freight forwarder -- that NVO before was really doing the paperwork; and so therefore, when it came in, in order to get the freight, the steamship company, in their tariffs -- it's a matter of record -- is really giving back to the consolidator -- I think it's around $500 roughly plus I think a percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.935" offset="19747088">Now one of the arguments has been in negotiations hey, what you did to us, you tariffed us right out of our business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.864" offset="19778853">You know, you're getting the work and having subcontractors doing the work by putting this in your tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.880" offset="19802885">And therefore, causing problems because, in most ports, it's based on the manhours that goes into the pension and welfare funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="4935.951" offset="19847189">In fact, we had a work stoppage in 19 -- I think it was 1970 -- where because of the hours generated by the conventional operators was going into the fund, and the automated carriers, especially Sea Land -- they were the only ones that were really in the business until, I think 1970; '69; '70.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.893" offset="19926915">Their hours were way down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.233" offset="19932348">Yet, the tonnage they were passing through the port was tremendous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.961" offset="19947186">And so finally, they got around in New York, and they changed to a tonnage basis; but they don't do this in Hampton Roads, and they don't do it in Baltimore, and they don't do it in Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.466" offset="19985220">And we see ports like Wilmington, North Carolina, where they're bringing containers in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.433" offset="20009148">And there's no work.</text>

            <text syncTime="5019.175" offset="20180093">One of the difficulties in this case, is that the Board dealt only with the incidents that were before it, and did not make comprehensive findings about the apparent discrepancies between what the Rules provide and what we are told are the practices under the Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.084" offset="20259715">As we point out on pages 9 and 10 of our Reply Brief, the Rules in terms apply to containers owned, leased, or used by carriers; and indeed, there's testimony in this case that their application was not restricted to those owned by the carriers; and findings in Conex.</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.704" offset="20342157">I'll recount on page 10 of our Reply Brief to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.326" offset="20360652">I don't know why the Respondent union emphasizes so strongly that the Rules are restricted to those owned by the carriers because those are the ones that are facilities of the common carrier as to which obligations under the Shipping Act cause special problems; rather than, the ones where it's easier to justify the discriminations that the Rules apparently require.</text>
