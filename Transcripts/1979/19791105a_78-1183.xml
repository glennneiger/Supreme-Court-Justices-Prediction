            <text syncTime="16.569" offset="169671">The petitioner Carbon like all the other employer members of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association is required by law to bargain collectively with the United Mine Workers of America.</text>

            <text syncTime="52.340" offset="312717">The International bargains and negotiates the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.310" offset="328600">It comes to the bargaining table holding itself out as able to speak for all of its members in support of the branches and to commit them to the promises that it makes in the bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.346" offset="392756">The International by its constitution has supreme Legislative, Executive and Judicial authority over all of its members and its subordinate branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.139" offset="439881">However, the UMW has structured itself into a three-tiered organization with the International Union at the top, the districts in the middle with jurisdiction in particular geographic areas, and the locals at the bottom with jurisdiction in particular mines or companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.448" offset="529115">The union has also unilaterally structured itself in such a way that the local unions at the bottom of the tier are at Carbon and generally elsewhere judgment proof against the satisfaction of substantial judgments for damages for breach of contract.</text>

            <label>Mr. David D. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="320.918" offset="1387081">They could enforce it by suit, they can -- they are bound by it, they have the benefits of it, they are obligated to comply with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.939" offset="1435146">Out of this collective bargaining arrangement the employer Carbon and other operators have obtained a commitment from the International Union to settle all disputes and differences that arise between the employer and the employees and the union during the life of the agreement through a grievance and arbitration procedure rather than by strikes and work stoppages.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.570" offset="1569625">That commitment consists of two elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.013" offset="1583417">One of them is the agreed procedure itself leading to binding arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.107" offset="1603793">The other is a specific commitment that the parties agree and affirm that they will maintain the integrity of the contract and that all disputes and claims which are not settled by agreement shall be settled by the grievance and arbitration machinery provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.471" offset="1669308">And this Court in Gateway Coal Company v. United Mine Workers held that that constituted a binding implied no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.718" offset="1718209">It is of course the policy of our national labor policy as expressed in the Federal labor laws that collective bargaining agreements and particularly commitments of this sort to settle during the life of the contract by binding arbitration shall be enforceable and shall not be permitted to become or to be illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.348" offset="1832730">Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley law expression a Federal policy that the Court should enforce these agreements on behalf of or against labor organizations in order to bring about industrial peace and stability during the life of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.275" offset="1920502">Other provisions of the Act evidence such same policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.682" offset="1938056">Section 204(a) states that employers and employees shall exert every reasonable effort not only to make but to maintain agreements made in the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.938" offset="2015169">Despite that binding no-strike commitment in the coal contracts there were during the period of time covered by this case 31 strikes at the mines of Carbon alone over issues that were arbitrable under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.257" offset="2100433">The record shows that in the area of the Coal Operators Association in southern West Virginia of which Carbon is a member, during the same period of time there were literally hundreds of such strikes and more than a thousand mine-days of work were lost over these disputes that it had been agreed would be settled peacefully through the grievance and arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.706" offset="2218193">These strikes were not authorized by the International or district unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.332" offset="2240658">In each case the district acting as an agent of the International sent representatives to the local unions who informed meetings of the local that the strike was disavowed and not authorized and instructed the men to return to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.933" offset="2351104">I think there is no evidence whatsoever that they acted in anything but good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.466" offset="2373256">That is to say they wanted the men to return to work, and there was nod nor wink nor anything of that sort indicating the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.618" offset="2421844">But repeatedly they stuck to the same routine without any results and although they threatened repeatedly to use the other means that they had available to them to stop the strikes, none of those mans that they referred to or that they threatened to use were ever utilized by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.691" offset="2518183">Their position was and has been that they had no obligation to do anything more than they did and of course the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in this case held that they had no obligation and have no obligation to do anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.779" offset="2638451">Well, it gets different I think that our case against the International is stronger let us say in the sense because the district is in the context of this case acting as an agent acting for the International.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.334" offset="2704697">The vacant commitment is by the International Union but the liability of the locals in this case, which is not an issue in here, was predicated on the mass action theory that all of the members of the local went on strike when the mines went on strike, including the officers; and that therefore it represented the action of the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="721.887" offset="2990895">The record shows that the union has a variety of means that it can use to attempt induce or coerce compliance with the no-strike clause including disciplinary action not only against members but against the local as such -- finds against the local -- removal of the officers of a local, improvision of a provisional government for the local, and many things which are not spelled out in the constitution but I think are inherent in it such as giving the members instructions that a picket line is not authorized, that they should cross the picket line or that they should remain at work despite the picket line because the picket line is contrary to union policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.243" offset="3188381">None of these things were ever done, including any disciplinary action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1005.601" offset="4125759">The 1950 agreement used the words "and" exercise their best efforts to the available disciplinary measures to prevent work stoppages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.170" offset="4164002">That was deleted from the contract in 1952 and the Fourth Circuit relied upon that deletion as meaning that there was no remaining obligation to -- or no intended obligation on the part of the International Union' reasonable means to stop strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.601" offset="4249788">We think that that was error, it was error for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.391" offset="4268910">One of them is that it gives no meaning or significance, doesn't explain why the maintain the integrity language was retained in the contract and had remained in it to the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.692" offset="4326170">And secondly, the bargaining history the Court relied on which was that stated by the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in the International Union v. UMW is incompletely and inaccurately stated by the District of Columbia Circuit in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.029" offset="4403493">The full and accurate bargaining history is set forth in the NLRB case which was a subject of the Court of Appeals decision known as the Boone County case in 117 NLRB and it appears in the bargaining history set forth fully in that case but the language that we are referring to was deleted in 1952 not because the International Union objected to doing something about strikes or attempting to take some action to stop strikes by its subordinate branches but because it objected to being required to use discipline in every case whether it was reasonable in a specific case or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.678" offset="4590111">And the Fourth Circuit's decision also like the District of Columbia Court on which it relied fails utterly to take note of the fact that in 1947 when Taft-Hartley was passed the union did several things with a contract to protect against financial lability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.897" offset="4683003">One of them was it deleted the expressed no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.036" offset="4695542">This Court in Gateway said that that deletion was not sufficient to destroy the no-strike commitment but the important thing was what language remained, as in this case the maintain the integrity language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.466" offset="4745279">But they deleted the no-strike clause in 1947 and they also wrote into the contract and the bargaining history in the Boone County case recites that it was for the purpose of relieving them of financial responsibility for a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.566" offset="4797628">They wrote into the contract the "willing and able" clause which said in effect the miners would work when they were willing and able to do so, they would have no obligation to work otherwise and that the union would have no obligation to try to make them work or to get them to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.339" offset="4888743">The bargaining history in the Boone County case further shows that after two years with that language the operators came back into the negotiations in 1952 and -- or in 19500 after -- it was 1947 that language went in and in 1950 they came into the negotiations and negotiated out the "willing and able" clause for the purpose, for the stated avowed purpose in negotiations of reestablishing the union's financial responsibility for wildcat because it had a wave of such strikes under the "willing and able" clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.856" offset="5050807">All of this language is overlooked, not referred to at all of its bargaining history in the Fourth Circuit's decision because that court relied upon the District of Columbia Circuit's decision which incorrectly and incompletely stated what appears in the findings of fact which were not rejected by the District of Columbia Circuit in the Boone County case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.005" offset="5159372">But the fact remains that the "maintain the integrity clause remains in the contract to this day, committing the International Union to maintain the integrity of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.261" offset="5208377">Our position is that that is a commitment to an affirmative action, it is a commitment to take all reasonable means to try to prevent breaches of the no-strike clause and that no other meaning, no other reasonable meaning can be attributed to it but exactly that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.817" offset="7294621">The International Union referred to here has to do with the International Convention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.261" offset="7444459">They represent on the policy committee the membership of that policy committee and once the policy committee which consisted at that time of 175 or 200 members, that policy committee made the contracts and executed and authorized them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.034" offset="7515512">They were not ratified by the membership at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.566" offset="7533589">In 1941 the contract provided specifically in the settlement of disputes, the arbitration clause, that pending the settlement of those disputes that there should be no cessation of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.806" offset="7594611">That was in the 1941 contract and, in addition, the 1941 contract contained miscellaneous provision that was bargained side by side to the effect that an illegal stoppage of work was a violation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.006" offset="7663365">Two provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.657" offset="7669948">Those contracts were carried forward through negotiations up until 1947 at which time the Taft-Hartley Act became effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.128" offset="7759914">They also negotiated in a miscellaneous clause that all the no-strike penalty and work stoppage clauses would be canceled, made nul and void by reason of the fact that the union argued that it would not be responsible and couldn't be responsible for the spontaneous, unauthorized walk out strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.741" offset="7874330">That was in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.702" offset="7886137">There were contracts negotiated between 1950 and in the 1950 contract again by negotiating parties -- by the parties -- the 1950 contract contained clauses to the effect that the parties -- both of them -- would maintain the integrity of the clause in the contract through disciplinary measures to see that the grievance machinery was carried out and that there be no strikes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.348" offset="9200724">Now, we on the other hand, the union at the bargaining table and in this record say approximately the same thing, that these employees of these companies are hired by the company, they fired by the company, they are directed by the company and if the company says it will cause too much hard feeling and be too harsh to fire these people, the union says on the other hand that we take the charter away from this local union and probably spread to other local unions, and certainly they don't want that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.946" offset="9335202">In union procedure, the union, its constitution and law, it is very strict on the trusteeships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.184" offset="9364146">It takes an extended period of hearings, it takes extended reports and it requires a long time to take a charter away from a local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.402" offset="9408972">In addition to that, they talk about disciplining a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.503" offset="9421406">That member has a right under the Landrum-Griffin Act and under the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2352.014" offset="9511476">He has the protection of going through appeals in the union in 6 or 8 months perhaps after the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.336" offset="9552750">Maybe the discipline might be finished and maybe it wouldn't be And it is the judgment of the union that disciplinary action is not something that would protect either the union or the operators in stopping these strikes, that their judgment has been negotiated on since 1941 up to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.747" offset="9638327">And I might say that the reason for the 111-day strike, the top thing on the agenda of the negotiators was the question about these unauthorized strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.809" offset="9694647">If the Court please, it has long been the policy of the national labor laws to encourage collective bargaining as a means of lessening industrial strife and promoting industrial peace.</text>

            <text syncTime="2943.200" offset="11876185">But the means that are reasonable, what constitutes all reasonable means in any given case is of course going to depend upon the particular facts and circumstances of each strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.381" offset="11924877">And one of those factors is, when did the union get notice of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.722" offset="11938252">When did they have an opportunity to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.451" offset="11949223">And in this case the jury awards damages I think leads you inevitably to the conclusion that the jury didn't find the International Union liable from the commencement of each strike but from such point as the jury determined they should have acted and had notice and an opportunity to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.368" offset="12044831">With respect to the meaning of integrity, some light may be cast upon it by the fact that one of the several directives that the International Union issued to its members in locals between 1951 and 1966 telling them that these strikes were unauthorized, that they were a problem for the union and calling upon the locals and their officers to act against them, in one of those it refers specifically to the fact that the strikes -- wildcat strikes that were occurring in the locals threatened the integrity of the joint bargaining relationship -- contractual relationship between the operators and the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.816" offset="13130585">No, Your Honor, the Court of course long ago said that it is the function of the Federal courts in developing substantive law under Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley law to develop law to give effect to the national labor policy expressed in those laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.059" offset="13259630">No, but it says very clearly, Your Honor, that the labor policy is to make collective bargaining agreements enforceable and particularly commitments to settle disputes peacefully during the last contract and grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.462" offset="13325249">And therefore when the parties agree on a no-strike clause and say this is the way we will settle prior disputes during the life of the agreement, the party that makes that agreement is under an obligation to prevent its breach.</text>
