            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments first this morning in Andrus, the Secretary of Interior against Idaho.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="11.905" offset="150967">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.954" offset="163192">This case comes here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.195" offset="188165">It presents the question whether the Carey Act of 1894 requires the Secretary of Interior indefinitely to reserve from appropriation for other public or private uses, some 2.4 million acres of desert land within Idaho for the eventuality that the State may be able and willing to select all or any part of such acreage for irrigation and reclamation under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.040" offset="299551">The statute is set forth at pages 2 through 5 of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.795" offset="334555">Its language, in our view, is clear and direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.912" offset="351065">It authorizes the Secretary of Interior with the approval of the President is, as the statute says, authorized and empowered upon proper application of the State to contract and agree from time to time with each of the States to enter into contracts with the States which will then be binding upon the United States to donate grant and patent to the State certain desert lands not exceeding a particular amount of acreage in each State on the condition that the State covers them to be irrigated, reclaimed and occupied.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.484" offset="509262">The statute provides that after the Secretary approves the State's application for grant, the land is then segregated from the public domain for a period of three to 15 years to permit the State to undertake the required reclamation and irrigation.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="118.752" offset="578330">Mr. Smith, you say that the question presented is whether the Secretary of Interior must reserve indefinitely the 3 million acres reserved or mentioned in the Carey Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.431" offset="629112">Actually, all we have before us in this case is 27,000 -- an application for 27,000 acres.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="137.307" stopTime="250.130">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="137.307" offset="652622">Well, that's the way the -- Mr. -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the case originally arose on the -- on the State's application for 27,400 acre tract to reserve that under the temporary withdrawal statute of 1910 which permits the State to ask for a temporary segregation in advance of a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.337" offset="748753">The -- that application was rejected by the Bureau of Land Management on the -- for the reason that the -- that some -- some of that land was being used for stock driveway purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.537" offset="801520">The State then appealed that determination to the Interior Board of Land Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.438" offset="829106">And that -- and that body that administrative body within Interior affirmed and rejected the State's argument which in part was focused on the -- on that particular tract but the State then began to make the broader argument that it was entitled to have a reservation of its maximum quota under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.894" offset="926908">While the case was pending in the Interior Board of Land Appeals, the State brought this action in the District Court of Idaho for -- to withdraw declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.397" offset="968913">And specifically, it asked for a declaratory judgment that the State has an absolute right to demand up to 3 million acres of desert land, and that the Board of Land Management -- the Bureau of Land Management, that is, has no discretion to deny request for segregation of desert lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.290" offset="1040488">So, the case, well, you're right that the case originally arose out of this narrow application, but it became -- it became broader as the State requested broader relief, a relief which the District Court granted and which the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.855" offset="1158771">I think that there is a case of controversy here, because the judgment of the -- of the Court -- of the District Court as affirmed by the Court of Appeals since before this Court requiring the Secretary of Interior to -- to withdraw and -- you know to withdraw -- you know to manage the public lands in a way to ensure that Idaho will ultimately get its 3 million acre quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.508" offset="1277367">In fact the -- the judgment says that Idaho is entitled to have withdrawn and patented 3 million acres providing that (a) that they're all lands of such character in kind, and that the State fulfills the condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.850" offset="1326791">So there is -- I think the controversy between the parties is now over, you know, the propriety of this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.417" offset="1353017">Although I agree with you that originally, the case started with this application for a withdrawal of a particular tract.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.944" offset="1615182">I think -- you know, I think the chronology of it is such that the case arose out of the particular application for the 27,400 acre tract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.109" offset="7307786">Novel in that unlike most federal statutes, it's only been before this Court once in its 84 years of existence, and surprising in that the Act is before the Court again at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.936" offset="7339133">And that in 1970 the Department of Interior felt that the Act was so obsolete and useless said it repealed all of the Carey Act regulations assuming that they'd never be used again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.120" offset="7391901">As the Solicitor made a brief reference, technology and advances, and deep well, and in sprinkler systems have now restored some possibility of achieving the original congressional purpose and offer an opportunity to offset something up to 2 million acres per year lost and farmland every year.</text>

            <text syncTime="2140.550" offset="8665527">And in addition, it's important to note that it is not likely or possible or feasible for a block of 3 million acres to be sought under the Carey Act, and it's also important to note that there is no such sword hanging over the Secretary to make and discomfort his -- his discretion in this regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.445" offset="8845145">The Carey Act obviously, by its terms, identifies no specific lands, and we claim no entitlement as to any specific parcel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.597" offset="8877746">But as to a general right of entitlement which ought to be considered by the Secretary in his classification and planning process and should have been since 1894, we urge that position on the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.057" offset="8923617">But the District Court's position actually says is that it draws a very careful distinction, it suggest a very careful balance between the rights of the State and the rights of the Secretary rejecting the Idaho in presenti argument rejecting the U.S. argument about right discretion, instead holding that there's a right of entitlement under the Carey Act created by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.403" offset="9012955">That that right is not so absolute that the State can perfunctorily select any particular parcel of land that wishes for the Secretary has other withdrawal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.977" offset="9051303">But third, if the State meets the Carey Act conditions, the Secretary has no unfettered discretion to deny applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.957" offset="9079202">Fourth, if the land sought has been withdrawn for other purposes, the State may apply for reclassification which petition should be handled in the ordinary course and subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.088" offset="9119744">And fifth, since Congress prescribed acreage entitlements to the State in 1894, the Secretary should preserve suitable amounts to honor applications as they come in overtime.</text>
