            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Solicitor General, you may resume where you left off yesterday.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wade H. Mccree</label>
            <text syncTime="16.379" offset="168939">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.004" offset="183359">The concessions that petitioner makes in his brief and those my brother Mr. Bruno made in his argument yesterday affirm the accuracy of the government's statement of the question in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.516" offset="245426">We stated the question to be whether the Emergency School Aid Act authorizes the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to withhold the special funds provided under that statutory program from a school district whose faculty assignment policies have a disparate racial impact most justified by educational needs, without a showing that they violate the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.761" offset="358379">We argued yesterday that section 1605(d)(1)(B) which is the statutory provision providing for disqualification of certain school districts, establishes a result test for the disproportionate demotion or dismissal of faculty or other personnel, and this of course requires us to focus on the second clause which provides "or otherwise engaged in discrimination based upon race, color or national origin in the hiring, promotion or assignment of employees."</text>
            <text syncTime="105.626" offset="525876">And of course, the construction that the Court accords to this clause will determine the validity of the regulation which petitioner admits has not been adhered to by its school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.071" offset="607692">We suggest that there is no reason why racially disparate hiring, promotion or assignment should produce a result different from disproportionate demotion or dismissal to justify the requirement of a motive for one and not for the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.477" offset="697240">And we have endeavored to --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="150.311" stopTime="156.899">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="150.311" offset="704658">Maybe you and we would agree with you, but maybe Congress didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.171" offset="724093">That is the question, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wade_h_mccree" startTime="156.899" stopTime="253.612">
            <label>Mr. Wade H. Mccree</label>
            <text syncTime="156.899" offset="730990">That is indeed the question, Mr. Justice Stewart, and I have tried to surmise why the Congress used different language in these two instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.204" offset="788146">And I think the best argument that occurs to me at this time is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.611" offset="813850">The attention of the Congress was focused upon what had been de jure separate school systems in the South which, of course, were dual school systems and were duplicative in so many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.246" offset="880306">There was the white school and there were, as were known in those days, the "colored schools," and there were principles for each, administrative personnel for each, as well as instructional personnel or faculty, and the Congress was concerned that in the dismantlement of dual systems that black employees or minority employees would be disproportionately fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.501" offset="1009351">For example, if the system had 40 white principals and 10 black principals for a total of 50, and it ended up that it just needed 40 once the separate system was to be dismantled, the Congress focused its attention to the situation which might result in the firing of all 10 black principals, and therefore the language "disproportionate dismissal."</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="253.612" stopTime="254.776">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="253.612" offset="1117811">Or demotion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wade_h_mccree" startTime="254.776" stopTime="371.488">
            <label>Mr. Wade H. Mccree</label>
            <text syncTime="254.776" offset="1122513">Seems appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.324" offset="1128678">However, one has difficulty with a concept such as disproportionate hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.764" offset="1154382">What does disproportionate hiring mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="264.489" offset="1161279">I have difficulty with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.034" offset="1167548">Does this mean that if 5 candidates present themselves, 4 of one race and 1 of another, that to hire any other than a 4-to-1 ratio would be disproportionate?</text>
            <text syncTime="282.267" offset="1232436">This does not make sense to me in terms of whether the candidates had the skills that were needed at the time -- one might be a Latin teacher, an English teacher, a French teacher, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.561" offset="1289592">I have even more trouble with the notion of disproportionate assignment if it means in proportion to what?</text>
            <text syncTime="304.849" offset="1322820">In proportion to the number of people in the school system?</text>
            <text syncTime="308.155" offset="1335986">And I don't think the Congress wanted to establish a quota in the establishment of schools and the hiring and promotion and assignment of course looks towards establishment and not disestablishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.614" offset="1397844">And for that reason it would seem to used the phrase "otherwise discriminate" allows more latitude in the establishment and ongoing conduct of a school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.490" offset="1449357">And that satisfies me as a sufficient reason for using different language, but still having a results test, and as the regulation provides, the results test is met if the discrimination in hiring or assignment results in the school being identified as a school for children or for students of a particular race, color, or national origin.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="371.488" stopTime="376.867">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="371.488" offset="1589373">General McCree, would you say that the word "discriminate" means treat differently?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wade_h_mccree" startTime="376.867" stopTime="412.697">
            <label>Mr. Wade H. Mccree</label>
            <text syncTime="376.867" offset="1610794">I think that is what it means; I think that is exactly what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.971" offset="1631274">But that doesn't mean discriminate in the sense of a constitutionally impermissible discernment of who the persons were, because obviously they have to discern who they are to avoid the disproportionate dismissal or demotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.985" offset="1719359">So discrimination occurs in that process, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.919" offset="1739003">And yet it is conceded that that is a results test.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="412.697" offset="1754154">Wouldn't you say, Mr. Solicitor General, that the word "discriminate" or "engage in discrimination," to use the statutory language, standing alone implies some kind of an intention?</text>
            <text syncTime="426.889" offset="1810892">I mean, if you had discriminatory effect, then that would have its own meaning, but "engage in discrimination," doesn't that imply intent?</text>

            <label>Mr. Wade H. Mccree</label>
            <text syncTime="436.882" offset="1850911">Well, I think it certainly implies awareness or discernment.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.615" offset="1873795">Discrimination means to be aware of a difference, and it doesn't necessarily mean to implement.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.133" offset="1903888">I can discriminate between colors or among colors.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.775" offset="1926457">That doesn't mean I am going to do anything about it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="457.582" stopTime="458.636">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="457.582" offset="1933667">But that is a consciousness and awareness.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.636" offset="1937951">I just have a capacity to know, it's an awareness.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.755" offset="1950386">And again we're talking about a results test and it would just appear that the Congress used that phrase, "otherwise discriminate," to mean otherwise produce a result that would show that the statutory purpose which of course was to eliminate the distinction between de jure and de facto and to protect the children from the harmful result from racial isolation, as was stated in the congressional statement of purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.609" offset="2121853">Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask you a sort of basic question about the statute so I can have it a little, a little better understanding of the whole scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.986" offset="2155290">Literally it seems to provide that if there is a violation of any one of these subparagraphs, the educational agency shall never be eligible for assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.057" offset="2191548">It says, "No educational agency shall be eligible for assistance under this chapter if it has after the set date engaged in any of these practices" -- is that the way the agency reads it, or is a school board permitted to correct violations and then become eligible, even though it was in fact in violation for a period after June 23, 19--</text>

            <text syncTime="543.021" offset="2275453">It is quite the latter, Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.274" offset="2284440">The school board may apply for a waiver of the condition of eligibility, and if the waiver is granted, the school aid monies are paid forthwith.</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.659" offset="4190020">As we argued yesterday, we believe that we have here just a question of statutory interpretation and for the reasons that we set forth in our brief, we believe that it makes sense to apply a results test to the second clause of 1605(d)(1)(b), as well as to the first clause, where concededly a results test is required.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.533" offset="4865546">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I have just three or four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.641" offset="4889893">It is our position in considering the Solicitor's construction of Section 1605(d)(1)(B) that we look at the congressional history and we look specifically at Senate Report 92-61 which provides us with great insight into what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.673" offset="4958020">Again, the Solicitor in discussing why or perhaps why Congress would have a different standard for demotions and dismissals as opposed to assignment of staff, the Solicitor ignores the clear legislative history stated in 92-61 and by Senator Mondale, which I read yesterday, which it makes it very clear this is a particular concern they had that the motion in conjunction with desegregation orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.674" offset="5066062">In response to Justice Stevens' question about waiver, the waiver is irrelevant to this case because we contend we are eligible unless they find intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.085" offset="5107754">I will also note that they withhold waiver unfairly, and I will just -- the ESAA 2 case, the case that is pending on this issue, it's in the Second Circuit and is awaiting decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1264.630" offset="5161880">Well, is it not likely that in a situation where the possible violation is in a gray zone, is uncertain, that an adjustment is negotiated and a waiver of any claims of the Secretary are --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_f_bruno" startTime="1283.350" stopTime="1384.464">
            <label>Mr. Joseph F. Bruno</label>
            <text syncTime="1283.350" offset="5236799">Let me tell you how they construe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.608" offset="5245785">We -- and the ESAA 2 case deals with next year's funding which we were also held to be ineligible for -- the position of HEW is -- we negotiated an agreement with HEW, a memorandum of understanding which was the subject of the Cawfield case that General McCree indicated which was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.778" offset="5322480">We negotiated that agreement, that is a phased program that will take several years to implement the changes that HEW would like us to implement, and we have agreed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.406" offset="5361037">However, they withhold funding to us under the ESAA statute, under the waiver because they contend that a waiver is not available to you until you have eliminated all of these defects, not that you have reached agreement and you are eliminating them, until you have reached that elimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.233" offset="5424253">So we are now out of ESAA funding under their eligibility and under their waiver for several years down the road until we have concluded this agreement which they have approved with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.509" offset="5469393">Lastly, I would like to just note that the key word is discrimination in subdivision (d), it is the key word in subdivision (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.235" offset="5508263">Both subdivision (d), HEW concedes, is an intent test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.440" offset="5525086">We argue that it is an intent test in subdivision (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.135" offset="5539924">The language around discrimination, we contend, is simply in one way it is used engaged in discrimination, another it is in order to avoid participation so as to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.358" offset="5588825">That is clarification language, we believe, of Congress, maybe somewhat unartfully drawn, but the word "discrimination" having very definite meaning, and Congress said so during the debates.</text>
