            <label>Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="16.059" offset="168605">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.810" offset="183651">At the outset it might be helpful to state what this appeal concerns and what it does not concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.484" offset="214371">At page 291 of its opinion, the District Court said the inquiry here is not what is wise policy but whether the Congress has or has not adopted a policy which, wise or unwise, the law forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.826" offset="287723">We submit that this is the proper approach to the case and that the voluminous evidence in the preceding 290 pages of the opinion would be useful in forming and informing a legislative judge but not especially helpful when we address the constitutionality of the Hyde amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.634" offset="386884">We regard the issues as two - First, whether the Hyde amendment violates the equal protection component of the due process clause by authorizing federal funds for medically necessary services generally and for abortions only when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term but not for other medically necessary abortions and, second, whether by restricting the availability of federal funds for medically necessary abortions the Hyde amendment deprives pregnant women of the liberty protected by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment or the religious freedom protected by the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.229" offset="589281">Title 19 of the Social Security Act, commonly called the Medicaid Act, is a cooperative program under which the federal government provides financial assistance to the states that choose to reimburse the categorically need and optionally the medically needy for the costs of medical services in at least five categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.857" offset="703801">These categories are in-patient hospital services, out-patient hospital services, other Laboratory and x-ray services, skilled nursing services, periodic screening and diagnostic services, children and family planning and physician services.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.747" offset="775377">The act does not expressly require participating states to pay for abortions or for any other specified medical procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.513" offset="822397">The Hyde amendment comes into the picture in this fashion - In December 1977, in a joint resolution providing appropriations for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for the last ten months of fiscal year 1978, Congress modified an earlier version of the Hyde amendment to include these exceptions to the general prohibition against abortions, necessary medical procedure for victims of incest and rape -- excuse me, I have misstated myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.018" offset="968474">I would like leave to say that initially, in September 1976, Congress, by the so-called Hyde amendment, limited the availability of funds to reimburse the costs of medically indicated or therapeutic abortions by providing that none of the funds contained in the act should be used to perform abortions except when the life of the mother would be endangered by carrying the fetus to term.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.787" offset="1091563">This original Hyde Amendment has been subsequently amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.347" offset="1109744">It has been amended to add a second exception to the one where the mother's life would be endangered by carrying the fetus to term where necessary medical procedures for victims of incest and rape promptly reported are included, and whose severe and long-lasting physical health damage to the mother would result if the pregnancy were carried to term as so determined by two physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.830" offset="1231684">These revised versions have appeared in subsequent appropriations and the current form of the Hyde amendment now consists of just the first two, where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or in the case of victims of incest or rape when promptly reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.374" offset="1329904">The plaintiffs in these cases filed a complaint in 1976, the day on which the initial version of the Hyde amendment was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.483" offset="1370342">Cora McRae, the named plaintiff, a medicaid recipient, was in the first trimester of her pregnancy, wished to have an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.953" offset="1404197">She did not allege that the procedure was medically necessary or that continuation of her pregnancy would endanger her life.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.029" offset="1444530">The court entered a preliminary injunction, requiring the Secretary to fund all abortions, but then this Court decided the case of Maher v. Roe which provided in essence that the equal protection component clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that case was not violated by excluding non-therapeutic or elective abortions from federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.889" offset="1603981">This case then was sent back to the District Court to consider in the light of the Court's opinion in Maher v. Roe and the court took testimony over a period of 13 months and finally in January of this year decided that the discrimination between medically necessary abortions and other medically necessary procedures violated the equal protection component of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and that it further violated the protection accorded pregnant women by the liberty implicit in the Fifth Amendment, in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and in the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.675" offset="1827067">It also said in a passage which is not exactly clear to us that it violated the rights of juveniles because they were the persons who had the greatest occasion to request abortions to terminate their pregnancy.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.937" offset="2004177">Because they are under the Adolescent Health Services and Pregnancy Prevention and Care Act and he found that their equal protection rights were offended by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.354" offset="2057780">Our argument is essentially as follows - We contend that the Hyde amendment is rationally related to the legitimate governmental interests in preserving potential human life and encouraging child birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.941" offset="2120161">We submit that the first approach is to determine the proper test to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.607" offset="2150776">We suggest that in Maher this Court made it clear that the proper test was the rational relationship test.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.942" offset="2192154">In that case, which of course involved non-therapeutic or elective abortions, the Court held that it was sufficient if the Congress had a legitimate objective and if the measure was rationally related to it, and in that case it found that its interests in preserving potential human life and encouraging child birth was an appropriate relationship and it upheld the challenge under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.769" offset="2331439">We suggest here, where the classification is between medically necessary procedures generally and medically necessary abortions except those specified, that the same test should be applied and that the same governmental interests in preserving potential human life and encouraging child birth is a legitimate governmental goal rationally related to the refusal to fund generally medically necessary abortions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.295" offset="6901614">This case is one of simple principle and singular magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.085" offset="6920735">It involves the survival and the health of potentially millions of poor women in this country, and it involves reaffirmation of the simple rule of law of the written Constitution that this Court recognized in Roe v. Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.981" offset="6988340">It is very basic that, as the Solicitor General says, this case arises in the context of a medicaid program designed to provide a broad range of medically necessary and essential services to poor people throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.157" offset="7053019">And it is very significant, as the Solicitor General agrees, that it is comprehensive and that but for the Hyde amendment it would cover abortions as a mandatory medically necessary service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.961" offset="7112265">Does the Hyde amendment single out one medically necessary service?</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.848" offset="7131805">They preclude the exercise of sound medical judgment about the health of a pregnant woman or indeed even of the fetal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.445" offset="7174228">They prefer fetal life at the expense of maternal health and even maternal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.903" offset="7207978">If the District Court found the Hyde amendment repugnant to the entire scheme of the medicaid statute, they are also repugnant to the most minimal safeguards of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.629" offset="9770904">There are examples that are manifold in the record of the problem with this standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.745" offset="9791384">Let me just cite to you one which is the problem of the woman who gets pregnant with an IUD in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.515" offset="9818446">She suffers a 50 times higher risk of death because of an infection that occurs in the late second trimester.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.574" offset="9854704">You can never tell in the early stages of pregnancy which woman will suffer it, and the risks go 50 times higher is not a clearly substantial risk before the infection strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.904" offset="9904024">The FDA and even HEW recommend that the IUD cannot be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.812" offset="9927638">It is medically essential to do an abortion because of the danger of that rapid infection which if it strikes it is very difficult to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.925" offset="9972046">So this is a situation where -- and the HEW statistics show that between 1972 and '74, 17 women died in this manner in is this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.583" offset="10022724">So it is an example, Your Honor, of the problem of using maternal mortality statistics to measure the scope of life endangerment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.703" offset="10055220">Even the defendant-intervenors' witnesses in this case, one in particular testified that the risks of poor women are twice as high, two to three times higher than for women of the middle and upper classes, and that in addition he would estimate that his population, which is at a Catholic hospital and involves people coming for prenatal care, would estimate 15 percent of those pregnancies would encounter life endangering circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.196" offset="10197222">So when one compares that with the fact that you have less than one percent of prior abortions now certified under medicaid, the District Court's conclusion that really the effect of the uncertainty of the standard and the fear of investigation really leads to a crisis intervention standard which is simply too late.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.944" offset="10688219">In the third trimester in Roe v.

            <text syncTime="2669.219" offset="10781320">And we submit, Your Honors, that you have decided what the Constitution requires and what the minimum of rationality is or legitimacy of purpose is under the Constitution and you decided that in Roe v. Wade.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.212" offset="11037215">Miss Copelon, let me ask you in connection with the case that is non-funding, which you are not now talking about, Stanley v. Georgia, where the Court found that the government couldn't prohibit the possession of pornography even in one's own home as well as any number of other books in one's own home, based on an implied by the privacy, nevertheless two or three years after Stanley in United States v. Ridell, the Court held that the government could prohibit the purchase or sale of pornography even though the purchaser intends to use it in his home, doesn't that suggest that although the government must allow certain things if they are done entirely apart from government support, the government may proscribe access to avenues that would enable the person to enjoy that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="3783.811" offset="15239690">Your opponent has focused more narrowly on the precise interests of the government at stake here than I had really caught before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.655" offset="15275008">In your summary of argument, you describe the interest as that in preserving potential human life and encouraging childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.272" offset="15305519">But she makes the point that there is no overriding government interest in having a larger population, as some countries sometimes want to encourage childbirth generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.893" offset="15340001">I take it you do not mean by that just encouraging more births throughout the country you really are talking, or am I wrong, about the motion of preserving fetal life and the unborn fetus a chance to survive?</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.569" offset="15398724">That is what it is limited to, isn't it?</text>
