            <text syncTime="189.011" offset="859408">And the reason of course is it is economically unsound to permit two utilities to come into the same area and install the same facilities and to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.813" offset="906637">Because of the great amount of capital involved in this business it would be disadvantageous to the consumer.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.894" offset="1142993">We think the court below paid a great deal of attention to the fact that we were a franchised monopoly and although they didn't say this in their opinion there are things in their opinion that can only be explained by the fact that we have a monopoly status.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.139" offset="1227943">And I want to turn to the court's opinion because they started off by treating this order of the Commission as a valid time, place and manner restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.236" offset="1284368">Now, the Virginia Pharmacy case that this Court decided in 1976 specified exactly what the elements of a proper, time and place and manner restriction area.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.723" offset="1346226">And there are three -- three requirements, all of which must be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.943" offset="1367124">The first requirement is that the restriction of speech must not be based on the contents of the speech, it must be content neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.192" offset="1420100">The second requirement is that the restriction must serve a significant governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.097" offset="1447790">And the third requirement is that in imposing such a restriction there must be ample alternative channels of communication left to the facility or left to the speaker to communicate his views.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.719" offset="1526262">We say if the Court please that this -- that the court in saying that this was not a content-based regulation committed a fundamental error.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.081" offset="1567744">The restriction applied to controversial matters of public policy and, in particular, the utilities' viewpoints on those matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.288" offset="1984554">Other utilities did, including Central Hudson which is before the Court in the second case.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.998" offset="2011408">The promotional advertising involves this matter of encouraging people to use more electricity at a time when conservation should be the keynote.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.318" offset="2052681">That is something that is involved in the bill insert order as such although it may be a controversial matter within the scope of the bill insert prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.992" offset="2099388">But there is a separate prohibition that is subject to a separate appeal that we do not regard that issue as being involved, particularly in the bill insert case.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.909" offset="2182980">But we have no -- as far as Con Edison is concerned our desire is to speak out on such issues as whether some of our plants should be permitted to burn coal instead of high-cost imported oil so that we can not only save our customers some money but can reduce this Nation's dependence on foreign oil, which is a risky supply and one that we do not feel comfortable living with, because it can be cut off at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.672" offset="2314010">Another issue that we think is important to our customers and to our business is what is the future of nuclear power now that there has been an accident at Three Mile Island and a lot of investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.372" offset="6752841">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.684" offset="6778128">This case was initiated before the Commission by a complaint of consumers of Consolidated Edison who were members of the Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups and some individually who complained of basically an infringement of their First Amendment rights when Consolidated Edison had published their views on the merits of nuclear power; and request was made that the persons who had opposing views be given an opportunity to present their views in a subsequent bill insert of Consolidated Edison.</text>

          <turn speaker="schiff" startTime="1743.911" stopTime="1908.209">
            <label>Mr. Schiff</label>
            <text syncTime="1743.911" offset="7079058">Well, I think, Your Honor, that if -- yes, I think the Commission has barred the use of the billing envelope from dissemination of controversial subject matter views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.937" offset="7159097">One of the reasons for this is that the Commission is very much concerned that the bill inserts be used for messages specifically related to the needs of the customers who are paying for these bill inserts and that there is limited space involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.665" offset="7254079">So that as I will discuss a little bit more later, one of the alternatives that the Commission had before it, which Mr. Block has not addressed himself to at all, is the possibility of opening up the billing packet as a general forum for controversial views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.969" offset="7343208">That posed some additional problems, there were still some captive audience questions there, it would use up the billing space even more so and would detract from the possibility of the utility providing messages to the utility customers on matters such as what are your new rates going to be, what are your rights as a consumer in case there is cutoff of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.269" offset="7448430">We require the utilities at least once a year to tell the customers about their rights as consumers and that is supposed to be done in the billing insert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.603" offset="7497749">The legislature has indicated that we should require them to tell customers about new rate proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.934" offset="7535156">We signed a State law the utilities have an obligation to tell the consumers about the possibility of conserving energy in the process of using utility service, both gas and electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.510" offset="7617390">There is a need for safety information as to how to not use your equipment to prevent gas explosions and the like.</text>
