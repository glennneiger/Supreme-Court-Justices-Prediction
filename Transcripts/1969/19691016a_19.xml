            <label>Mr. James Van R. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="20.646" offset="185971">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.704" offset="198196">These are two consolidated cases reviewing the same decision by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.483" offset="225259">The ultimate question presented is whether state banking authorities can prevent a National Bank from providing its customers with an armored car messenger service to and from the bank, if they can do so on the theory that such a service amounts to the operation of a branch governed by a state law under the National Bank Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.444" offset="305194">Section 36 (c) of that Act provides in general term that a National Bank may establish and operate a branch if a state bank similarly situated would be authorized under state law to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.135" offset="367888">Florida, where this case arises is a state that does not permit branch banking at all and it is further established for present purposes at least that a Florida State Bank would not be permitted by the state authorities to operate the messenger service here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.379" offset="432880">I might say parenthetically the reason it's established for present purposes only is that the Court of Appeals noted in its opinion that there is litigation pending in a Florida State Court where this issue had been raised for the first time that will resolve presumably as a matter of state interpretation whether or not this kind of service is in fact prohibited by the Florida statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.084" offset="535698">However, subject to the outcome of that litigation which the Florida Court has stayed until this Court decides this case, the Court of Appeals accepted the interpretation of the Florida State Banking Commissioner who was one of the respondents here that the Florida Statute would prohibit this kind of service subject only to a retention of jurisdiction by the District Court to change its order.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="132.282" offset="632456">Let's see Mr. Springer, the Florida Court would say that this is not prohibited by a part of a statute then the issue we have here wouldn't be here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_van_r_springer" startTime="140.473" stopTime="142.466">
            <label>Mr. James Van R. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="140.473" offset="665266">Yes, yes, that is correct Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="142.466" offset="673207">Instead of putting the cart before the horse, is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_van_r_springer" startTime="144.834" stopTime="383.510">
            <label>Mr. James Van R. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="144.834" offset="682715">In fact, it seemed a little strange to me that the Florida Court would stay itself pending determination of this case, but it in fact until is done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.128" offset="719914">In any event, nobody knows what will happen to that litigation and unless something does happen, the Court of Appeals has in effect decided that this service cannot proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.172" offset="772054">The issue therefore in this case is whether the kind of messenger service involved here is a branch, being of course the term of order of the National Bank Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.207" offset="816149">If it's a branch then 36 (c) of the National Bank Act makes its legality depend upon state law and as I have said, state law for present purposes forbids it.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.703" offset="862229">If it is not a branch then its legality depends only upon the provisions of the National Bank Act relating to the powers of National Banks which do not refer to state law and are not in issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.178" offset="924087">As we see it, the definitional problem that this case presents breaks down really into two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.752" offset="950418">The first question is the threshold question of where we look for the criteria to determine, “What is a branch?”</text>
            <text syncTime="218.455" offset="977168">We say that naturally enough one would look to subsection (f) of the branching section of the National Bank Act Section 36, which says that the term “branch” is used in this Section shall be held to include any branch bank, branch office, branch agency, additional office or any branch place of business at which deposits are received or checks paid or money lent.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.827" offset="1058670">The Court of Appeals said however, that 30 -- Section 36 (f) is hardly adequate as a definition, those are the words that it used, and therefore that the law of Florida should determine what is a branch for purposes of this incorporation of state law that's provided for in Section 36 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="257.134" offset="1131917">As I've indicated if the Court of Appeals was right that in the case here, if we're right there remains a further question whether the District Court properly held that the armored car messenger service in question here was not branch banking as a matter of purely federal law under the Section 36 definition which the District Court treated as the exclusive definition and of course if the District Court was right, then Florida law has nothing to do with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.800" offset="1258559">There are -- these main two cases, there are two petitioners here, Comptroller of the Currency who has authorized the service in question and the First National Bank in Plant City, Florida, which is the bank that's conducting the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.301" offset="1316551">There will be argument on behalf of each petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.300" offset="1324596">In my argument I plan to cover the first of the questions that I've mentioned, the choice of law question, which has importance not only for this particular kind of service but for a variety of other services that National Banks offer or may wish to offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.360" offset="1384782">Mr. Edwards who will be arguing on behalf of the bank will deal primarily with the second question which assumes that of course that if we prevail on the first question, the question as to how the facts of this particular service relate to the federal definition in Section 36 (f) if that is in fact the governing definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.396" offset="1480913">That question of course also has great importance because there are a great variety or a great number of National Banks throughout the country that provides services or interested in providing services of the general nature of the services that are involved in Plant City.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.253" offset="1564400">Because of this division, I would hope to limit my statement of the case to a very brief statement of how the case arouse and the fundamental facts, leaving for Mr. Edwards a more detailed description of the messenger service that's involved in the case.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Van R. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="390.118" offset="1663875">In October 1966, after consultation with the Comptroller of the Currency's office, the Plant City National Bank began to operate its messenger service.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.095" offset="1711731">It was designed for the benefit of customers primarily stores in the outlying areas of Plant City, Florida which is a city of about 18,000 people some 20 miles inland from Tampa.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.848" offset="1766797">The messenger service has two elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.452" offset="1777142">First, an armored car, which pursues a daily route between the bank's office and the costumers' places of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.661" offset="1810056">A messenger arrives on that truck and he receives from the customer's sealed bags containing funds for deposit in the bank which he then delivers to a teller at the bank's office who opens the bags and then treats the contents as deposits when they are received at the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.138" offset="1883930">The messenger also delivers to the customers upon prior order by the customers sealed bags that contains change or funds for use in their businesses which have been withdrawn from the customers accounts before the truck leaves the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.341" offset="1940773">The second element of the messenger service is a secured receptacle, which is literally a hole in the wall and at shopping center with the drop slot where sealed bags or envelops containing funds for deposit in the bank can be left for pickup by the messenger service during the course its daily rounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.225" offset="2028231">The armored car operation was designed to comply specifically with paragraph 7490 of the Comptroller's Manual for National Banks, which is a compilation of pertinent regulations among other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.872" offset="2090820">That paragraph authorizes such an operation subject to the condition that the customer understands the messenger as his agent and not the bank's and that any funds received are not actually deposits until the teller at the bank accepts them.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.811" offset="2146617">The bank also obtained with respect to the shopping center pickup point a specific ruling from the Comptroller's office that that was permissible subject generally to the same conditions that I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.541" offset="2205550">Underlying both rulings of course was a determination by the Comptroller's office that such operations subject to these conditions were sound and safe services authorized by the National Bank as incidence to the conduct of a banking business and that they did not operate to the -- amount to the operation of a branch as to which of course state law would be pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.666" offset="2301994">Just as the messenger service was about to begin its operations, the respondent Dickinson, who was the Florida State Banking Commissioner sent a letter to the president of the bank and expressing the view that the services would violate Florida law and threatening suit if the bank did not cease and desist.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.360" offset="2372838">The bank promptly began this suit in the District Court seeking declaratory judgment and an injunction to prevent such state interference with the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.910" offset="2415052">The Comptroller of the Currency subsequently intervened as a plaintiff and the respondent, state bank here also intervened as defendants on the side of the state commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.152" offset="2471999">At the outset of litigation, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction allowing messenger service to continue and in fact that preliminary injunction has continued in effect until now so the service has been proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.865" offset="2530826">Then after exploration of the facts and affidavits and upon reading in depth voluminous depositions that were taken in the case, the District Court entered summary judgment in behalf of the National Bank and the Comptroller.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.285" offset="3872475">The Fifth Circuit's decision leaves us what seems to us an anomalous principle one which is apparently repudiated in this Court by the respondents, but which is enthusiastically supported by the amicus brief that's been filed on behalf of the National Association of State Bank Supervisors who I understand will be presenting oral argument and who represent all 50 of the state banking commissioners, including the one who is a respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.940" offset="3995146">We believe that the principle followed by the Court of Appeals is erroneous and that it is one that would be highly damaging to the proper regulation of the National Bank system.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.386" offset="4048959">We think that a straight forward reading to begin with of Section 36 of the National Bank Act makes it quite clear that Section 36 is designed to establish a uniform and exclusive definition of what is a National Bank branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.611" offset="4117817">The structure of Section 36 remains now very much as it was when it was first enacted in 1927 as Section 7 of the McFadden Act which for the first time allowed National Banks to engage in branch banking, generally speaking on the same terms as state banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.890" offset="4214888">The introductory paragraph of Section 36 provides that the conditions upon which a National Bank -- Banking Association may retain or establish and operate a branch or branches are the following and the word “branch” appears throughout the Section notably in subsection (c) to which I have referred, which says that “a National Banking Association may with the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency establish and operate new branches if such establishment and operation are at the time expressly authorized to state banks by the law of the state in question.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.546" offset="4649566">That seems to us a highly anomalous reading of a subsection of a federal statute which says that the term “branch” is used in this Section shall be held to include any branch bank office, agency, additional office at which deposits or receive checks paid or loans or money lent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.502" offset="4757400">Congressman McFadden who is of course the sponsor of the Act said at his own analysis of the act upon its passage that subsection (f) and now I'm quoting from his language defines the term “branch” and he plays outside of the way -- or away from the main office where the bank carries on its business or receiving deposits, paying checks, lending money or transacting business at the main office is a branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.369" offset="4864815">And of course this question of “What is a branch?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.784" offset="4874533">is relevant for a variety of purposes other than subsection (c) to which who we refer in our brief, including sections where there is no semblance of any incorporation of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.032" offset="4939525">It seems unusual that Congress would expect that these -- that the definition of branch for these purposes would vary according to the state where the particular National Bank in question is located and it seems even more anomalous to treat the word “branch” as having different meanings in different subsections of the same section enacted at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.453" offset="5037223">As we further detail in our brief, the Comptroller, the Attorney General and until this case, the Federal Courts have all treated the question of whether or not a particular enterprise is a branch as a question of federal law unaffected by local law0 and of course this is consistent with the general principle that when Congress uses a word unless there's some reason to believe, otherwise, Congress intended that that word should be defined and interpreted as a matter of federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.496" offset="5369396">As to that, of course the Walker Bank case involved the situation where nobody questioned that what was involved was a branch and that there was an incorporation of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.220" offset="5412237">The question there was, “Is all of the state law incorporated or as the Court put it, only some of it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.171" offset="5444106">The Comptroller made a valiant uphill argument that it was only the law relating to location that was incorporated and not the law relating to the manner in which a branch can be establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.587" offset="5513697">This case on the other hand, raises the question whether there is any incorporation of state law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.516" offset="5549432">There is such an incorporation only if there is a branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.944" offset="5567195">We would submit that the policy of “competitive equality” which is a genuine policy comes into play only to the extent that there is in the Act an incorporation of state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.173" offset="6264038">This involves not only armored car service of this type but involves a broad range of activities related to the lending of money which is another issue of some kind of importance in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.687" offset="6322134">Potentially, it could involve things like a bank credit card for example, which I suppose a state Comptroller could regard as a banking activity being carried on off the banks premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.977" offset="6383261">And if the state Comptroller chose to prohibit it, he could prohibit it and under the Fifth Circuit's theory, it appears that that would mean that in that particular state a National Bank cannot carry on that kind of activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.712" offset="6746258">Yes, so of course I'm happy to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.002" offset="6771336">So, as I have indicated we think that does have broad significance, some of which has been indicated in some detail by the brief filed by the Bank of Cornelia and a group of other national banks throughout the country as amicus curiae in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.029" offset="6843538">In sum, we think on this choice of law issue that the District Court gave Section 36, a simple straight forward and sensible reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.162" offset="6892022">The act provides according to that reading which seems not only sensible, but the least complicated approach which has some virtue that National Banks can have branches where state banks can have branches, but as befits a comprehensive scheme of federal regulation, the act specifies that uniformed nationwide set of criteria for determining what is a branch and therefore when we look to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.818" offset="6994631">I might just say a word by way of introduction to Mr. Edwards' point that of course the Comptroller in promulgating the rulings pursuant to which these activities are being carried on made a determination that this pickup and delivery services do not amount to branch banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.838" offset="7078745">The Federal Reserve Board for its own purposes which involve its regulation of state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System which are governed by the same law, the same federal law with respect to branching has made exactly the same determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.946" offset="7155127">We believe that those interpretations are first the only reasonable ones that can be given of the federal statute assuming we are treating the question as a matter of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.909" offset="7199013">In any event, we believe that the expert interpretations of the law that they are directed to administer by these two federal agencies is entitled to a certain amount of deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.267" offset="7244466">If there's an area of reasonableness that determination should be set aside only if it is found to be unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.689" offset="7286157">Therefore, we believe first that the question is before this Court is one of federal law and that the federal law was properly interpreted with respect to this kind of situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.642" offset="7393991">We have set forth some of that on our reply brief at page three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.202" offset="7424188">First of all, the Court starts of early in its opinion by saying that the controlling issue of law in this appeal concerns the District Court's choice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.314" offset="7456580">That is that court's failure to consult state law in determining whether First National's activities constitute branch banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.878" offset="7498898">Then it goes on to say First National attempts us to convince -- attempts to convince us that Section 36 (f) is the sole and monolithic definer of branch then by taking us through some level [Inaudible] and meandering past of the laws of agency in contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.867" offset="7554800">First National seeks to demonstrate that it is not a established offices or agencies whereas specified in Section 36 (f), deposits are received or checks paid or money lent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.596" offset="7597746">Such a line of argument is the Court of Appeals said in the principle and finally, it's said towards the end of its opinion we therefore refuse to pass the twisting pass of agency in contracts urged upon us in this case and look instead to the laws of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.816" offset="7666604">I think as I have said that considering that language plus the result, we have to say that in effect the Court of Appeals have said that the language of 36 (f) is superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.747" offset="7726373">It's there, but it really doesn't have any meaning because if the state calls it a branch, then it is a branch.</text>

            <text syncTime="1923.022" offset="7795440">I'd like to begin if I might by addressing myself just generally to how we got in to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.809" offset="7822608">I represent the First National Bank in Plant City who filed the suit for declaratory relief in the Federal District Court, in the Northern District of Florida where Mr. Dickinson resides in Tallahassee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.522" offset="7869419">We were faced with the situation of where we had gone to this Comptroller of the Currency who is our supervisor and our boss as it were and had cleared with him and had -- having analyzed his regulations and rulings that we could carry on this transaction that we do now carry on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.188" offset="7940159">We had prepared and began to render this service when we received a letter directed to us by the Assistant Deputy Banking -- the Deputy Banking Commissioner of the State of Florida simply telling us to cease and desist that their activities constituted branch banking under Section 659.06 of the Florida law and indicated that if we did not elect to cease and desist that they would take action as they had just recently filed against a bank in Panama City to require us to terminate this type of service that we were rendering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.331" offset="8060740">It was much later in -- as a matter of fact after a favorable decision by the Federal District Court and the appeal was well on to the Circuit Court of Appeals whenever the state court was first involved in this litigation by a service that was began by a bank in Tallahassee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.056" offset="8127613">So, that the state litigation arose much later in the course of time and there was no state litigation available or state decisions available that would guide anybody at the time that the District Court made its decision in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.661" offset="8186023">I might as a matter of passing point out to you that much later even after the Circuit Court of Appeals had entered its decision, there was a case in -- the Greater Mine and Financial Corporation against Dickinson decided by the Supreme Court of Florida wherein the Supreme Court Florida declined to determine that Section -- that Chapter 659 made the activities of a broker who was soliciting and accepting deposits for transmittal to a savings and a loan association in the state of California as a banking activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.551" offset="8309530">The Supreme Court at that instance said that the receipt of these moneys by this broker to transmit to Tal -- California did not constitute the acceptance of a deposit which would violate Chapter 659 of the banking law and in essence make that broker a banker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.773" offset="8370448">So, that that decision by the Supreme Court is available to us from the state of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.947" offset="8387166">There were no other decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.356" offset="8392808">There are no other decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.704" offset="8398137">The Circuit Court which is the court of original jurisdiction in Florida elected to simply wait the outcome of this case since the activities had been began on the base -- based on the District Court's opinion or decision that it was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.312" offset="8456652">I need to speak to also to the fact that we have been characterized as carrying on a subterfuge in our activities in Plant City.</text>

            <text syncTime="3051.672" offset="12310026">Somehow, it's been overlooked that there's also a trained, paid teller on this truck, trained by the bank to do all of the functions that a teller does in a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.545" offset="12353599">Both of these gentlemen have referred to the depository as a hole in the wall in the shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.709" offset="12378258">I invite the Court's attention to page 387 of the appendix in this cause to take a look at the hole in the wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.252" offset="12412426">What happened here was is that Plant City got its first large shopping center in its history and First National went out to that shopping center and rented a store and then set up its depository in the store within the interior mall next to the new chain stores which were moving into the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.775" offset="12506467">And when the shopping center opened, what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.188" offset="12520155">First National got every new account, every large new account out of that shopping center because it got the advantage of location which is so important in banking.</text>

            <text syncTime="3186.868" offset="12850866">To use a not very polite term, the guts of banking, may it please the Court, are the getting hold of money, getting deposits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.394" offset="12948982">Anyone of them and certainly one is clearly involved here which is receiving deposits and I'm talking about the functional act of receiving deposits, the getting the advantage of getting the money which is precisely what First National is doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3448.930" offset="13899107">We say that there are about four different views which have been advanced to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.204" offset="13916139">The first is that 36 (f) is to be narrowly construed without any reference whatsoever to the competitive equality upon which the Section clearly was based in its enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.676" offset="13958040">We say that's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.802" offset="13966608">We made this argument before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.054" offset="13975594">It took that view but we say, even, even in that event, if that is the correct view, then we still should have prevailed because the contractual arrangement or fictitious the Court should look the form to substance, there is no real agency relationship and accordingly even by a common law principle, agent to the bank are authorized to receive deposits and are therefore receiving deposits off-premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.802" offset="14082591">That's the first argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.219" offset="14088234">The second argument is, we made an argument that 36 (f) was exclusively def -- exclusively federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.219" offset="14116237">It was a complete definition without any reference to state law, but it should be construed broadly and liberally for the purpose of effectuating competitive equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.990" offset="14167333">And this view incidentally is one of the position which is taken in a little pamphlet by the legislative reference section of the Library of Congress in evaluating certain of Mr. Saxon's rulings and it suggests a broad construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.695" offset="14222190">We argued that construction before the District Court until we found Judge Lindberg's unpublished opinion in State Chartered Banks then we had an authority better than a pamphlet from Library of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.208" offset="14268165">And so we began to rely without moving away from the other argument, but arguing in the alternative, we began to rely on Judge Lindberg's State Chartered Bank's decision which is that 36 (f) is a partial definition where function is the important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.487" offset="14345279">Function and physicality that is presents a prima facie test of banking, of branch banking under the federal definition and if the operation meets that prima facie test, then the threshold is crossed and you look to State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.027" offset="14407450">Now, we support that view before this Court and recommend it to this Court as being the best view.</text>

            <text syncTime="4294.461" offset="17281233">There is one point that I would like to refer to before it slips my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.245" offset="17316342">The presentation is -- has been made here that all that is -- has happened in this operation is that money has been delivered to customers and picked up and brought back.</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.063" offset="17375587">This is done routinely, six days a week by the armored car.</text>

            <text syncTime="4327.017" offset="17411427">At the depository, it is not only night bags that are placed into the depository, but also envelopes containing the transmittal slip which is really just a regular deposit slip with the conjured language on the back of it in trying to make an agency out of it and this is the most important point because it should resolve this case below and we should have never been here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.062" offset="17523649">The District Court held as a matter of fact that the First National was paying checks through this operation because it would actually deliver the cash to a customer, say it, over a cash store and take a check in return drawn on the bank that is paying checks, that's a Section 36 function.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.268" offset="17612466">But the District Court strangely enough said, it isn't going to approve that, but it will approve the rest of the operation because the First National is otherwise substantially complied with the Comptroller of the Currency's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.205" offset="17664188">And we've never been on this -- we've constantly argued that this was wrong, we made this point to the Fifth Circuit but the Fifth Circuit didn't reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.760" offset="17714448">We do not see how if in the course of the operation of the armored car.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.110" offset="17751855">There was a paying of check operation that that can be ignored for the purposes of definition of 36 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.980" offset="17791248">The argument is made that the question is moot because First National promised to stop it, but number one, the record doesn't show that they stopped it; number two, they're not restrained by the District Court from doing it; number three, we are restrained from interfering with them, so we can't find out what's going on; and number four, the promise to stop a wrong -- sir?</text>

            <text syncTime="4519.842" offset="18182771">The argument is made that the use of these contractual arrangements are not subterfuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.164" offset="18212028">It is now been suggested that they have some sort of a practical value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.157" offset="18235956">This record will not support that whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.321" offset="18252675">We made the argument from the commencement and sought to prove it as much as we could, that the use of these contractual arrangement was solely for the purpose of evading the effect of federal law and particularly the effect of 36 (f) and 36 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.547" offset="18313592">We showed that the Comptroller had reversed himself when the Comptroller became Mr. Saxon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.366" offset="18332818">We showed that Mr. Saxon's letters in explaining his rulings, expressly said that the contractual arrangements were used so that 36 (f) should not be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.729" offset="18390288">We also showed that First National Bank by its letters to the comptroller expressly said that we are using these contractual arrangements because exactly as you required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4584.415" offset="18441070">These were used for the purpose of meeting the Controller's regulation and avoiding the effect of Section 36 and for no other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.206" offset="18476178">Now, it's been suggested that there might be another legitimate reason for using the contracts, the contractual arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.629" offset="18517870">That simply won't hold water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.794" offset="18526542">All one has to do is to look at the two basic contracts that are involved, the so-called dual comptroller contract on page 91 of your appendix and the so-called transmittal slip on page 1 to 23 of your appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.890" offset="18582967">And any lawyer reading that can see quite clearly that there wasn't any attempt here to limit liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.862" offset="18606791">These are vastly different in language from the classical night depository agreement where specifically a bailment is spelled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.906" offset="18650990">The District Court did not make a finding of fact that First National was not receiving deposits off-premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.989" offset="18687352">The District Court said as a matter of law that these contracts are clear and unambiguous on their face and the District Court therefore refused to consider the purpose, the intent of the contract whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.698" offset="18758196">We made the same presentation to the Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.819" offset="18774601">The Court of Appeal agreed with us and the Court of Appeal expressly says that it -- it finds plaintiffs' arguments of agency and a contract indefensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.758" offset="18822353">It finds that it's engaged in the use of paper evasions and admittedly, parties can contract, a bank and its customer can contract as to when a deposit is received.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.875" offset="18878882">But this cannot be done for the purpose of frustrating public policy for the purpose of evading law and that is precisely the only reason these arrangements were used and one can look all day but with an honest heart, you can find no other answer but that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5081.637" offset="20429928">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.788" offset="20442572">The 50 officials of the State Government responsible for the supervision and regulation of the 6,400 State chartered banks of the country have filed in a brief as an amicus curiae with this Court urging affirmation of the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.963" offset="20507251">Now, because both our position and the opinion of the court below had been characterized in a manner by the petitioners with which we do not agree, I would like at the outset of my argument to pose the issue as we see it and its resolution by the Court of Appeals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.134" offset="20583946">Now, the petitioners argued that the determination of what off-premise business activities of a national bank amount to a branch is governed exclusively by 36 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.412" offset="20628982">And they contend that all that is involved in a case of this type a technical analysis of the understanding between the bank and the customer in the light of applicable agency contract of commercial law to determine whether there's been a loan, deposit or check transaction away from the bank's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.747" offset="20706408">Now, if there has been no transaction, there's no branch and no reference to state law is required or permitted in this analytical process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.229" offset="20744338">Now, under this reasoning, the Comptroller of the Currency has recently ruled that national banks are not branching when they engage in the check cashing or deposit making process through off-premise shopping center depositories or mobile facilities or when they engage in a loan making process through off-premise loan production offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.348" offset="20832737">Now, if the result is to -- is a competitive disadvantage for state banks who have prohibited such activity by state branch policy embedded in state law, the petitioners assert that this is precisely what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.248" offset="20896371">Now, the construction of Section 36 (f) which we support, which is the principal argument presented by the respondents and which is the one reflected in the decision of the Court of Appeals is this, the Court of Appeals started with this Court's decision in the Walker Bank case and there this Court has exhaustively studied the legislative history of the branching provisions of the McFadden Act of 1927 and the Banking Act of 1933 and reached the conclusion that the dominant intent of Congress was to establish competitive equality between national and state banks in the matter of branching based on State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.146" offset="21063973">And the Court then concluded that the only way to reconcile Section 36 (f), the definitional section and Section 36 (c), the branching section within the framework of this Congressional intent, was to consider Section 36 (f) as a functional definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.204" offset="21144221">If there is an off-premise facility at which activities are performed, essential to the loan, deposit or check paying process, then reference must be made to state branching policy in a state law to determine if the off-premise activity would be a branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.386" offset="21220916">Now, in other words, the Court of Appeals considered Section 36 as a substantive definition of essential banking functions not as a technical delineation of the party's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5293.893" offset="21278908">For the whole controversy in the McFadden Act of 1927 when both Section 36 (c) and (f) were adopted and later in the Banking Act of 1933, revolved around the dispute between unit banking and branch banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.530" offset="21349543">And in the real world of banking, the resolution of that dispute is not made by a contractual relationship described in small print on a transmittal slip.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.036" offset="21395519">It is made by a determination of the extent to which banks can compete off-premises in the functional essentials of banking, loans, deposits and checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.447" offset="21445151">Now, that is what the Court of Appeals did and there is no conflict or obscurity about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.611" offset="21469811">It said that if no matter how you look at it, unless you want to throw away all the concepts of the functional business of banking, the off-premise activities in the case, in this case, inaugurated by the petitioners below involved a deposit-making process and a similar determination had been made by the state chartered banks case court and so they turned to state law and found that off-premise activity would be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.092" offset="21575764">State banks under the branching policy of the State as reflected in its state branch statutes and they therefore concluded, it would be unlawful for national banks and that is the decision which we too seek.</text>

            <text syncTime="5380.977" offset="21627277">Would you agree that Congress could authorize national banks to do all the things that are challenged here?</text>

            <label>Mr. James F. Bell</label>
            <text syncTime="5388.165" offset="21656012">Yes Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.722" offset="21662281">There's no argument that the Congress of the United States could have given national banks this authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.357" offset="21684851">The question is one of statutory construction did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5399.941" offset="21703137">Now, I would like to turn, if I may, at this point to some of the lines of arguments advanced by the petitioners against this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.625" offset="21737827">The first one, I think frankly it is directed to the wrong forum, to the Courts rather than to the Congress, but basically it's this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.614" offset="21777847">Imaginative and vigorous national banks are developing modern concepts of banking which would be frustrated under the ruling of the court below because it would subject national banks to unfriendly state legislation construed by unfriendly state banking departments and would result in a disparity of treatment of national banks by the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5439.876" offset="21862902">This line of argument errs on at least six accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.678" offset="21882128">First, there is a disparity of treatment of national banks by the various states in the matter of branching today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.674" offset="21910026">12 permit unlimited branching, 15 prohibited altogether and the remaining 23 adopt a middle ground with widely varying restrictions offering some of the benefits of banking, but trying to protect small country banks, for example, by expansion of city banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.039" offset="21983483">So, diversity was specifically intended by Congress when it rejected the concept that branching should be determined by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.359" offset="22020786">So, the very diversity that the petitioners decry is what Congress wanted because in every state, there are differing economies as well as divergent issues on the issue of branch versus unit banking and Congress sought to adopt that standard as a measure of off-premise or branching activities of banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.775" offset="22110438">Second, with regard to this high qualification of unfriendly state legislation, the idea that a state is a going to pass branching legislation designed to hurt national banks, when that legislation is equally applicable to state banks, is simply totally unsupportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.822" offset="22174699">And when petitioners make this assertion, all they are doing as opponents of unit banking are saying they don't like any restrictions of branching, but that is a matter which Congress has decided the state should decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.822" offset="22230706">Now, somehow, the third, the concept that imaginative national banks are trying to keep up with the times and are being rewarded is deserving of the same answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.861" offset="22270830">For what may be imaginative expansion to some may spell a break down in unit banking and banking concentration to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.109" offset="22311790">Mr. Hanson has filed a brief for the Independent Banker's Association making this point very strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.182" offset="22336136">Now, there are states which permit precisely the type of activity for which petitioners argue here, California for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.080" offset="22371662">But those states with a strong policy favoring unit banking such as Florida do not and there are arguments on both sides of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.928" offset="22407084">Congress has said State legislatures should be the forum and national banks as well as state banks can go into a state legislature anytime they want to, to change the policy of their state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5588.976" offset="22459225">Fourth, the concept that the decision below somehow rather places national banks at the mercy of supervisors or indeed as the Comptroller posed the question this morning that state banks supervisors can prevent something, we believe is totally unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.811" offset="22526621">The source of state law is not supervisor imagination but the statutes of a state reflecting its branch banking policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.494" offset="22565386">Now, this whole field of off-premise activity is relatively new today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.863" offset="22586807">So, there are not many State judicial decisions and as each instance arises, the questions comes up is this in accord with or contrary to the branching policy of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.308" offset="22636648">And in the absence of judicial decisions, supervisors usually seeking the advice of the State Attorney's General have been called upon to construe the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.708" offset="22678235">Now, each ruling is non-discriminatory, equally applicable to both state and national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.169" offset="22708015">Each ruling is subject to judicial review for its correctness and indeed as has been pointed out here, the ruling of the supervisor of Florida itself is now before Florida courts for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.011" offset="22759424">Now fifth, the argument of the Comptroller that somehow the result of the decision below is tantamount to supervisor approval of Comptroller decisions is equally without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5676.041" offset="22807489">Of course, the comptroller doesn't have to seek supervisor approval of his decisions, but since Congress has provided a statutory framework with an intermeshing of Federal and State law relating to branching, surely that doesn't mean that an iron curtain has to descend between the comptroller's office and the state supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.853" offset="22890768">Consultation as to the meaning of state law is not tantamount to supervisor approval of the decisions of the comptroller.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.702" offset="22922219">And indeed, the Sixth Circuit in the Wayne, Oakland Bank case has held that this intermeshing demonstrates that Congress intended consultation and cooperation between the two agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.217" offset="22972270">Now, also and finally, the petitioners in their supporting amici have compiled a fearsome list of activities which they assert that state supervisors can strike down under the decision of the court below on the guise of their branches forbidden under state law.</text>
