            <label>Mr. Charles K. Cranston</label>
            <text syncTime="26.383" offset="208854">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.420" offset="221080">This case involves the resolution of issues concerned with the regulation of a basic industry of the state of Alaska, its fishing resource, and in particular it relates to the manner in which applicants maybe awarded net gear licenses to fish for salmon in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.872" offset="330898">The statute which is here under attack was passed by the 1968 legislature of the State of Alaska and requires that a licensee in order to be awarded a salmon net gear fishing license must either have been licensed as a net gear licensee in the area in which he wishes to fish or that he was actively engaged in commercial fishing for three years in the area in which he desires to be licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.168" offset="476035">The appellees sought to have the statute declared unconstitutional in the light of certain provisions of the United States constitution and in the light of certain provisions of the state of Alaska constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.668" offset="534026">The State of Alaska constitutional provisions require that there shall be granted no exclusive right or privilege of fishery and that the fishery source is reserved to all of the people for their common use.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.643" offset="593899">A three-judge district court in Anchorage Alaska held the statute unconstitutional as being in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the two Alaska constitutional provisions to which I have referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.815" offset="662653">It is the position of the State of Alaska that summary judgment was improperly granted in this case and that the basic issue involved is whether or not the provision allowing new entrants into the salmon fishery by virtue of their right to fish commercially for three years is -- the issue is whether this is illusory, whether it is meaningless or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.135" offset="779891">The three-judge district court concluded that not withstanding the provision, entry into the fishery was controlled not by the state as intended by the statute but by the fisherman themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.580" offset="845720">It is the state's position that this conclusion of the three-judge court is not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.263" offset="876440">And for that reason, summary judgment should not have been granted on the record as it appeared before the Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.150" offset="911966">The allegations in the pleadings relative to this aspect of the case were denied and the pertinent affidavits and answers to interrogatories did not touch on the issue although the Court itself found that there is no right of new entry other than by the permission of those already in the fishery.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.620" offset="1025860">The Court in the three-judge district court concluded that in fact, for a person to be illegible for a salmon net gear license in Alaska, he had to receive employment by those already engaged in the fishery and therefore the right to his license was not within his control but was with in the control of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.648" offset="1137977">And on this basis the Court concluded the fishery in effect was closed, there was and exclusive right and the right was not open to all who might wish to enter.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.742" offset="2282350">It states that the licensee must have been actively engaged in the activity of commercial fishing and there are other statutory requirements which require that a perspective licensee furnish affidavits to this effect that he has actively engaged in the fishery for each of those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.901" offset="2394990">I believe that the very questions which have been asked indicate that in order to determine the application of the statute to the fishery involved that there are questions which have not been resolved and which should have been resolved prior to the lower court's awarding summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.017" offset="2487463">This case is a clear example of the proposition that important constitutional questions are usually not appropriate for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.525" offset="2533439">Appellees themselves have cited the case, England versus Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners which contains the “it is the typical, not the rare case in which constitutional claims turn upon the resolution of contested factual issues.”</text>
            <text syncTime="625.879" offset="2606895">And I would assert that this is the typical case involving an important constitutional question for the state of Alaska and that there are contested factual issues remaining and certainly the conclusion of the Court should not rest upon such an inadequate factual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.563" offset="2677635">I would give some examples of the inadequate factual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.017" offset="2699473">The appellees state that the new entry provisions are illusory and whether they are illusory depends upon facts which they have set forth in their statement of facts much of which did not appear as the record in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.580" offset="2781706">For instance, it is possible for one to engage in salmon fishing as a commercial licensee and troll, trolling is an activity which does not require salmon net gear, it is commercial fishing, it is salmon fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.442" offset="2853177">The relationship of this activity to the application of the statute has not been investigated by the lower court and is not on record at this time in order for this Court to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.992" offset="2903333">Also, appellees assert that the unique effect of 11 salmon registration areas in Alaska prohibits easy movement of commercial salmon fisherman from one area to another area with the statutory prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.042" offset="3003538">We will agree that there are 11 salmon fishing registration areas but we will not agree at this stage in the proceedings that the effect of those regulations on the statute prohibits free movement of fisherman from one area to the other to their economic detriment as appellees assert.</text>

            <text syncTime="751.526" offset="3109491">Mr. Justice, Alaska, the coastline in which the salmon fishery is engaged covers approximately 3000 or 3500 miles from southeast Alaska near Ketchikan up through near the Artic Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.662" offset="3190053">The coastline is segmented into 11 districts based generally upon geography, the coastline, the types of bays involved and perhaps based upon the species of fish which appear in those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.672" offset="3270092">And when one acquires a license to fish for salmon in Alaska, he is licensed only for one of those 11 areas and if during one season he acquires a license for let's say the southeast Alaskan area, he may not then fish in the Bristol Bay area, he is limited to a particular area during each season and appellees assert that the statute coupled with the area requirement in effect closes the class of those who may engage in the commercial salmon fishery.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles K. Cranston</label>
            <text syncTime="975.243" offset="4004342">The District Court did not discuss this ground too heavily Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.237" offset="4032345">The appellees have argued this ground quite heavily in their brief and I would assert that in order to reach the conclusion that appellees may be deprived of the use of their vessels during any particular salmon fishing season because of the area requirement is not supported by the record at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.737" offset="4146343">The main point I am attempting to make is that the fishery regulation in Alaska is extremely complex involving areas of differing types of salmon, differing weather conditions, differing sea conditions and that at the stage in which the District Court reached its conclusion, none of this particular factors had been investigated by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.652" offset="4278000">The second point which the state of Alaska is urging is that the District Court should have abstained completely from reaching a conclusion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.775" offset="4338500">The basis for our argument that the District Court should have abstained is due to the fact that appellees asserted that the statute violated unique provisions of the Alaska constitution, those provisions are as I have stated that no exclusive right of fishery should be granted and that the fishery source is reserved to the people for their common use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.174" offset="4448110">These provisions so far as I have been able to ascertain are unique among the state constitutions and no constitution contains language similar to that of Alaska and therefore, the interpretation of these provisions have not been resolved by any Court of any state including Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.416" offset="4561063">Generally, there are three grounds upon which abstention maybe granted and three grounds which support the requirement that a District Court abstain from deciding federal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.847" offset="4622712">First, abstention should be granted to avoid a decision involving federal constitutional grounds where the state law may resolve the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.695" offset="4674121">This of course is applicable to this case and that the application of the exclusive right of fishery provision of the Alaska constitution could resolve this case without the necessity of deciding a federal constitutional question under the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.951" offset="4751130">Also, abstention has been required to avoid needless conflict with the state's administration of its own resource and its own affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.012" offset="4815391">This is in recognition of the fact that the state's police power should be the proper means to regulate a resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.757" offset="4862412">The appellees would assert that the constitutional provision is so clear on its face that it needs no further interpretation and certainly needs no interpretation in the light of the state's police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.660" offset="4926046">I would assert that this is not true and an example would make this point clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.268" offset="5040462">I've set out the two provisions of the Alaska constitution which are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.491" offset="5077347">Every constitution contains the requirement that no state shall impair the obligation of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.158" offset="5107963">However, this Court has ruled that a state may in fact impair the obligation of contract pursuant to a valid exercise of its police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.088" offset="5155715">I would assert that in this case, the state of Alaska may create if necessary in the valid exercise of its police power and exclusive right of fishery, the extent to which it may do this should be determined by a Court of the State of Alaska and should not have been determined by the Federal District Court of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.992" offset="5255293">These provisions as I have said have not been interpreted by any state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.525" offset="5277445">Appellees assert that the case of Hynes versus Grimes Packing Company which interpreted similar federal statutory provision during territorial days is determinative of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.708" offset="5338154">However, in the Hynes case, the Secretary of Interior had granted an exclusive right of fishery over a particular area to a particular native village.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.586" offset="5389667">There is no attempt on the part of the Secretary of Interior to justify his granting of this right pursuant to any conservation purpose or other regulatory police power purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.208" offset="5444211">In this case of course, the State of Alaska has recognized that the accumulation of excessive net gear has resulted in an over harvest of the fishery and has created severe management and enforcement problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.585" offset="5509726">This is quite different from the case of Hynes where there was no regulation of this type involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.761" offset="5546402">Lastly, the appellees have asserted that the industry of fishing is a common calling and as such is apparently immune, from state regulation of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.584" offset="5609723">The mere fact that industry is called the common calling does not remove it from state regulation if that regulation is necessary in order to preserve a resource to rectify management and enforcement problems with that resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.512" offset="5693419">This has been done in the past at common law at such economic pursuits as the sale of intoxicating beverages or the transportation of people for hire were considered common callings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.352" offset="5752769">However, at the present stage, these activities are heavily regulated by the states and quite often certificates of public convenience a necessity are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.774" offset="5802506">There is no reason why salmon fishing especially with net gear should be removed from state regulation simply because it is connoted as being a common calling.</text>

            <text syncTime="2000.384" offset="8104939">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.580" offset="8117687">I believe that the issues in this case as in many cases maybe a little clearer if we look at it in their historical context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.691" offset="8162095">Alaska, when it was a territory had its fisheries regulated by the Federal Government and back in 1926, the White Act was passed pertaining to the Alaska fisheries to a considerable degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.767" offset="8226461">Now, Section 1 of that Act provided that there be no exclusive right or a special right in the fisheries of the State of Alaska and that section was passed with --and the history of it shows that it was passed with the expressed purpose of doing away with some administrative orders that had existed prior to that time whereby the licensing for fishing in certain areas was restricted to the prior licensees which is basically what we're confronted with in this subject litigation, a revival of this old outlawed provision that was outlawed by the White Act back in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.087" offset="8415692">Now, after the White Act was passed, the Secretary of Interior who had a subsequent time had in his powers the regulations of the fisheries of the then territory of Alaska provided for an Indian reservation called the Carlock Indian reservation and he provided in that same regulation that the fishing in the waters abutting the Carlock Indian reservation would be restricted to the Carlock Indians and their licensees, in other words the Indians themselves could license third persons to fish with them in this particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.774" offset="8578487">The matter was tried and it came to the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Hynes against Grimes Packing Company in the 337 U.S. was decided in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.357" offset="8632822">The Supreme Court held that the provision limiting the right of fishery in these reservation waters even though the promulgating of the regulation as far as the establishment of the Indian was upheld that the secretary could not limit the fishing in those waters to the Carlock Indians and their licensees because it ran above of the White Act provision that I have just been referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.002" offset="8743372">Now, this is the background, that decision was made in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.892" offset="8766986">In 1955, prior to statehood, Alaska held a constitutional convention and at that constitutional convention, one of the provisions that was enacted was Article 8 Section 15 and this provides for a regulation or restriction on the regulation of fisheries almost identical to the White.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.268" offset="8864475">The provision and I quote from the Alaska constitutional provision is that “no exclusive right or special privilege of fishery should be created or authorized in the natural waters of the state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.666" offset="8922049">And I would like with Your Honors indulgence to read the comment of the Natural Resources Committee of the constitutional convention as to why they enacted that particular constitutional provision into the constitution of the State of Alaska.</text>

            <text syncTime="2224.890" offset="9002924">In proposing Section 15 of Alaska constitution, the Natural Resources Committee of the Constitutional Convention made the following commentary, no exclusive right of fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.885" offset="9050885">This section is intended to serve as a substitute for the provision prohibiting the several right of fisheries in the White Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.267" offset="9084426">Instead of using the terminology of that Act, the purposes sought by it are a given expression in a prohibition of exclusive right or special privileges of any person to the fisheries of the state, and that's the commentary on the article on state lands and natural resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.841" offset="9158719">Now, Your Honor this subsequently was adopted as the constitution of the state of Alaska, this provision as a part of the constitution when the constitution -- when Alaska was admitted to statehood in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.056" offset="9211591">And as I have explained initially, this was based on the White Act provision and the purpose of that White Act provision was to prevent the restriction of fishing rights to those who had had those rights in prior years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.397" offset="9277001">Now, we have had unfortunately in Alaska quite a history of legislative attempts that created local favoritism, efforts to give the people in Alaska advantages over non residence particularly and even as to residence in certain areas over other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.117" offset="9363832">I refer to the case of Smith against Freemen in 280 2d U.S. where it was attempted to impose a $250.00 license fee for non resident fisherman as opposed to a $1.00 resident fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.355" offset="9416808">Mullaney against Anderson in 342 U.S. where they attempted a $50.00 resident license fee as opposed to a -- $50.00 non resident as oppose to a $5.00 resident fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2348.236" offset="9496325">This case does not depend on none residency because it would work a discrimination as to residence in the state as well as non residence and that it restricts it to specific areas in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.471" offset="9545226">But it also -- it is the same general plan to give an advantage to the local fishermen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.918" offset="9571035">That is an unconstitutional advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.392" offset="9580962">In Brown against Anderson, the attempt was made to, where under certain hardship conditions, only fisherman of a local area could fish and no non residents could come in to fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.350" offset="9628818">In the last year, the case of Alaska against International Union of Operating Engineers, 393 U.S. involved in attempt to give local laborers of the union favoritism over non-resident laborers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.428" offset="9689109">And it is our position Your Honor that Chapter 186 of SLA 1968, which is the legislation with which we are here concerned comes right in this series of an effort to create a local monopoly in the fishing areas of Alaska to those who had prior licenses in those particular areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.091" offset="9775731">Now, to better understand the nature of this discrimination, I think some background of the fishing processes and the nature of the licenses required is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.687" offset="9834141">In Alaska, any fisherman must have a commercial fishing license, every fisherman must have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.200" offset="9864129">In addition where fishing is done by vessels and far and away, the large amount of fishing is done by vessels, there must be a vessel license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.626" offset="9897880">Now, there is no restriction on the issuance of the commercial fishing license or the vessel license but there is a third thing that is needed for the almost all the fishing that's done in Alaska and that is a salmon net gear license, and it is by what we consider this attempt to setup a monopoly is by use of that salmon net gear license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.395" offset="10008952">The law specifies that only those who are licensed in prior years in a specific area may secure a salmon net gear license unless he fishes commercially for three years in that specific area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2568.091" offset="10375711">Yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.083" offset="10379682">And for instance, in Bristol Bay which is the, one of the most valuable of the areas and one of the, one of the most valuable ot ther which the largest runs of fish are anticipated, in fact they anticipate this coming year that there will be 37,000,000 fish caught in Bristol Bay alone, the largest run they anticipated in record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.268" offset="10464423">And in that area, it is impossible to troll.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.188" offset="10484172">There is no troll, the statistical report show no troll caught fish and it is well known and the District Judges below had perfect cognizance of this that you could drag a troll line through there day in and day out and you'd never catch a fish because of the salty waters and the fact that the suck eye salmon do not strike in those waters, they will hit a fly up in the stream further up when the water gets fresh but they wont hit the troll lures and there's no trolling so there's no way of getting entry into this valuable fishery unless you're in the favorite class, those who had a license before or unless one can secure the permission of one of those licensees to fish with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.143" offset="10663894">In other words, it is exactly the thing that was prohibited in the Hynes case where the licenses were limited to the Carlock Indians and their licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.682" offset="10706108">In the Hynes case, the Carlock Indians had authority to let other people get into the field and issue licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.688" offset="10734111">In the subject case for instance in Bristol Bay, there are two gear net fishermen usually to a vessel and one owns the gear and if you can't his permission to fish with you and you can't a gear license, you're frozen out of the field, you can't fish at all and this of course is the exact provision that was involved in the Alaska constitutional provision of article 8 Section 15 which prohibited the use of, the exclusive right or special privilege in the fisheries and which was interpreted prior to the adoption of Alaska constitution by the Supreme Court in Hynes against Grimes Packing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.846" offset="10902758">And I might add that at the time that that was passed by Hynes against Grimes Packing, we not have only had a decision by the highest Court of the land, the Supreme Court, but at that time, it was the highest Court of the state, that is the territory because their territory had a District Court which was a District Court for the territory of Alaska and it had a joint function as a territorial court and in effect federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.554" offset="11017592">There was no territorial appellant court, the appeals went to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and then to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.016" offset="11051447">So we have a clear decision on a constitutional provision not only by the Supreme Court of the United States but the highest court of what was then the state and we might -- I might add that Alaska, the Alaska Supreme Court has held that when a statute is adopted from another jurisdiction, it takes with it the construction placed on that statute by the highest court of that jurisdiction, I refer to the case of (Inaudible) against Lathrop Company in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.978" offset="11187284">Now, we feel that not only is this violative as I have shown and clearly so with a Supreme Court decision on it already of the federal constitutional issues, of the state constitutional issues but it also is a discrimination based purely on past fishing efforts and violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.557" offset="11277563">In that regard, we feel that the case of Takahashi against Fishing Gain Commission in 340 34 U.S. is very much in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.259" offset="11320404">As Your Honors, will recall in that case, the state of California prohibited fishing by certain aliens and in expressing their reason, they gave very much the same reason as my learned colleague here has given today that this was a conservation method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.598" offset="11377768">That there was too much gear in the waters of California and then it was necessary in order to conserve fishing to reduce the amount of gear and therefore to eliminate certain aliens from the fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.167" offset="11436074">And this learned Court of course held that that was violative of the Equal Protection clause even though the purpose was a justifiable purpose assuming it was a justifiable purpose that of conservation.</text>
