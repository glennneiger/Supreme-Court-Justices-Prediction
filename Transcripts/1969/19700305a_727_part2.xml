            <label>Ms. Louise Korns</label>
            <text syncTime="10.393" offset="144906">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.012" offset="171447">Just to briefly recap the factual situation here, three New Orleans police officers went to 1826 O. St. in New Orleans bearing two arrest warrants for Donald Vale involving prior narcotic crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.760" offset="246366">They wanted to be sure that the accused is at this address before serving these warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.973" offset="267264">They knew that Mrs. Vale, his mother and his brother Donald live there and they want to elate Donald have him take off again.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.234" offset="300283">So, they parked their car about half a block from the house and watched it and they saw about 15 minutes later they saw a transaction take place between a man, Saucier who approached the house in a car and Donald Vale who came out of the house and apparently sold narcotics to this man in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.046" offset="391607">So, they approached the car, arrested Donald Vale and Saucier.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.281" offset="408534">Donald Vale, as he got close to go back in his house arrest them for possession of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.958" offset="443225">First, meanwhile they had seen as they approached, they had seen the man in the car put something in his mouth and swallow it which to experienced narcotics officers like this just meant one thing that he was swallowing narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.914" offset="495052">So, after they arrested the man in the car and Donald Vale, they frisked and briefly found nothing on them, no weapons, no narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.265" offset="528384">And then the police officers the record shows told Donald Vale that they want to go in and search his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.560" offset="549595">The door to which he had left open in coming out to make this sale to find the narcotics that they were sure were the source of this supply that he had passed on to Saucier.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.942" offset="595153">Thereupon, they entered the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.421" offset="609050">Shortly thereafter within minutes thereafter Mrs. Vale and Donald's brother James entered the house and the police officers informed them also they were going to make the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.253" offset="652413">And the within five or ten minutes in the back bedroom which appear to be a man's bedroom, the police officers testified they found the heroin and Dilaudid they were seeking in the coat, several coats hanging in a closed locker.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.653" offset="718033">The State of Louisiana believes that following the legal arrest which clearly took place here in front of the house, the police officers were entitled to make an incidental search.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="166.013" stopTime="173.253">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="166.013" offset="767457">Was the arrest legal because of the capias that the officers had or was it legal because of what they have seen that apparently Donald Vale?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louise_korns" startTime="173.253" stopTime="231.811">
            <label>Ms. Louise Korns</label>
            <text syncTime="173.253" offset="796400">What they had seen Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.047" offset="803610">We don’t rely at all on those capiases there's no -- the State of Louisiana feels that if they fade out the picture as far as this search went.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.477" offset="837256">They only served is adding probable cause for the warrantless arrest because they were for prying narcotics offenses which had occurred a couple of weeks before and more over.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.650" offset="869961">At least one of these three offices had been involved, the record shows in those prior arrest and the record also shows that, at least one or more of these officers had not only arrested Donald Vale either been a connect with these prior narcotics arrest that were familiar with him in his narcotics transactions, knew Saucier the man to whom he was apparently selling, knew that this house was lived in by Mrs. Vale, Donald’s mother and his brother James.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.085" offset="979675">The record shows that they knew that.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.945" offset="999111">So the State of Louisiana is not relying at all on these capiases for this arrest, but only on this warrantless arrest which took place before the house.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.053" offset="1035577">Thank you.</text>

          <turn speaker="louise_korns" startTime="234.692" stopTime="321.229">
            <label>Ms. Louise Korns</label>
            <text syncTime="234.692" offset="1042160">Now, the evidence shows that the police officers didn’t know who was in that house when they arrested Donald and Saucier in front.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.568" offset="1073612">It shows that officers were very concerned with the idea that at this very moment either Mrs. Vale or brother James or Donald’s girlfriend who traveled around with him to various addresses was right at that very time getting either hiding the narcotics, taking him out the backdoor, disposing of them in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.608" offset="1157831">So, as Louisiana sees it.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.655" offset="1169951">There was the dilemma faced by these officers and they either had to seize this evidence right now or not at all because I know yesterday the Court was opposing the problem of whether there were any alternatives to an immediate warrantless search and as a practical matter it’s Louisiana’s position that there were no practical alternatives because of the time involved in getting a warrant and the fact that -- One thing is clear, not knowing whether anyone was in the house or not, the officers had to enter the house and search it fairly thoroughly to find out even if whether someone else was in the house because confederates often hide in closets and under beds as this Court knows and it was only about fairly thorough search of the house that the officers could even determine that there was no one in the house to dispose --</text>

            <label>Ms. Louise Korns</label>
            <text syncTime="324.256" offset="1400351">No that’s perfectly true, that’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.687" offset="1410069">But they had to make a search of the house in fair detail to be sure that no one was hiding in the house, in closets, in rooms, and so forth and under beds.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="338.266" stopTime="347.072">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="338.266" offset="1456462">Well, do you think they were entitled of that point to search for firearms to see whether they were exposed to any danger from occupants of the house?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louise_korns" startTime="347.072" stopTime="436.391">
            <label>Ms. Louise Korns</label>
            <text syncTime="347.072" offset="1491675">Well, actually I think the question of firearms I guess is always lurking in the background but with what narcotics addicts generally, I don’t think weapons are generally involved in these crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.036" offset="1551548">I think mostly it’s the police officers they're concerned and the record here shows with getting to the evidence before the people involved with the narcotics can get rid of it just like in this case, Saucier got rid of the narcotics which Vale had just sold in by swallowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.460" offset="1621243">And the officers, the record here show that they rushed first to the bathroom to listen for the sound of running water when they approached, they testified that and looked around in the toilet bowl and so forth because looked in the basin and in any drain like that where narcotics could be disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.544" offset="1717582">So, really I think -- I don’t think I will be frank and say no I don’t think the officers were afraid that they’d be shot at from the house or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.915" offset="1751019">I think their primary and only purpose was to try to get hold of this narcotics which they were convinced Donald Vale, they just seen him sell but because of Saucier swallowing that evidence they -- because that would have been there right there if Saucier didn’t swallow the evidence and arrested Vale for this present narcotics sale and the Saucier had the evidence that would’ve been it.</text>

            <label>Ms. Louise Korns</label>
            <text syncTime="464.918" offset="1963029">Well, sure I mean I think they -- I don’t think there is concerned no with guns for narcotics addicts as they also for say burglary suspects are people who commit crimes of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.218" offset="2012244">There's no doubt about it when they -- when they frisked down Vale and Saucier.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.387" offset="2032933">When they first arrested them, they -- I think the record will show maybe that they were frisking for possibility of weapons or narcotics, but they did testify that they wanted to go in that house because they were sure that that's where the hoard of narcotics were.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="498.923" stopTime="509.303">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="498.923" offset="2099075">As -- well, when they were in the house as I understand it except for this appellate here when they just arrested there was nobody in the house?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louise_korns" startTime="509.303" stopTime="538.660">
            <label>Ms. Louise Korns</label>
            <text syncTime="509.303" offset="2140557">That’s right, the thing is that they didn’t know that though Mr. Justice Stewart until they had gone all through the house to be sure because they knew that Mrs. Vale and James live there and then of course when Mrs. Vale and James showed up within about five minutes after the officers got in the house has but before they’d found the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.151" offset="2207953">Then, the only other place they could’ve been hiding in there was Donald’s girlfriend, but I think by that time they’d run through the house enough to be sure that nobody was in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.813" offset="2250585">But they didn’t know this until they got in.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="538.660" offset="2258004">And the fact is there was nobody in the house?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louise_korns" startTime="540.502" stopTime="727.913">
            <label>Ms. Louise Korns</label>
            <text syncTime="540.502" offset="2265422">The fact is there was nobody, but they have no way of knowing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.844" offset="2290709">And as a matter of fact as I say the record shows that they positively knew that somebody could be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.512" offset="2313383">Now, the State of Louisiana just wants to oppose to this Court the practical difficulties involved if the police were going to get a warrant to search for this narcotic evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.573" offset="2369703">As I say, they first had to get into the house to be sure no one was hiding in there or would’ve done no good to put a cord in around the house without first finding out there was nobody in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.442" offset="2409096">Having found out that the only two people on it were James and Mrs. Vale then they would’ve had to call in other police officers to keep these people under surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.344" offset="2468760">Their movements under complete surveillance are to keep -- take them out of the house during the time in which they took them to get a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.054" offset="2499584">And in owing to perish at least, search warrant issued by criminal district court judges and at least one of these arresting officers because only they three knew the facts would’ve had to go back to the police bureau and typed up the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.658" offset="2573981">And you have to type up an affidavit for a search warrant in about six duplicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.156" offset="2599999">Police officers don’t reduce probable cause to writing with the greatest to speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.253" offset="2628420">It’s been my experience these men often have all kind of reasons why they do things.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.342" offset="2648691">They're not the most articulate people in the world particularly when they have to write down and often in the past they used to put down too little but now because Court decisions throw out worst they put down much too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.871" offset="2694875">They put down everything they’ve seen and gone and so forth and so it runs on for pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.458" offset="2713161">Then, they’ve got to find the judge to study this warrant and find out whether it’s stays probable cause and if he’s in his court or in his chambers and busy they have to wait, and then present it to him and if he’s going home then they have to track him down and find him and I think at the best with everything going in your favor takes at least three hours to process a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.879" offset="2806888">And often it takes a whole day before you can get the whole thing typed up and the judge satisfied and signed and back and served the copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.597" offset="2841788">You have to give one to another clerk’s office so they’ll know what property they’re going to seize and then make returns and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.851" offset="2878777">So really you know these the officers, the record here shows that the officers approached Donald Vale’s house around noon with luck they could very well have been back with the search warrant later to that afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.704" offset="2934157">But if any little interference had come up for some reason or another they might not have been back until the next day and unless they had kept these people under close surveillance, they would’ve been any narcotics evidence left in that house when they got back.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.976" offset="3011271">And also --</text>

            <text syncTime="727.913" offset="3015032">How do you -- how can you say that if after they had seen this transaction they just simply going down and get a search warrant, they hadn't been seen by Vale or anybody else at that time?</text>

            <text syncTime="740.094" offset="3063724">Well, in the first place they didn’t know that they hadn't been seen by the Vales and actually probably knew there were people in the house watching everything they did or they might very well have been neighbors watching what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.305" offset="3112626">We don’t know about that but these things get around very quickly among people of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.322" offset="3136658">Not only that Mrs. Vale and James came back to the house within minutes after the police officers got in to house.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.275" offset="3168423">So therefore, but they might’ve very well have gotten back to the house seeing the police officers put Saucier and Donald into the cars.</text>

            <text syncTime="1099.374" offset="4500877">That is if he encountered Vale six blocks away from the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.321" offset="4528671">In that circumstance, would he have any basis for thinking the house was the source of supply having been seen him come from the house to make the sale?</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.805" offset="4562631">Not at all, not only that but the house wouldn’t be the place of the arrest here it’s true that the arrest took place at the front steps of the house but remember this, Donald Vale had gone into the house when Saucier had first given him let him know he want a narcotics had come out of the house, leaving the door open, looking up and down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.964" offset="4643192">When Vale saw the police officers approached his house and arrest him right there at the car, he turned around and started toward the front door and as a matter of fact if the police officer had been aware of all the decisions which police officers aren’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.881" offset="4698885">If I've been there I would just wait that the minute let Donald walk back into his house and then when a few steps he would’ve been inside the house and you say, alright -- alright, although under Chimel I guess you would’ve had to lame walk all the way back to the closest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.772" offset="4766490">But anyway, nevertheless, it was so clearly a question of the arrest taking place at the scene you know of the search talking place at the scene of the crime immediately contemporaneous with the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.671" offset="4822079">That we think these are the facts at which governed this case and would clearly distinguish an arrest which took place on the street for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.017" offset="4851440">There, the place of the arrest would be the street and there the officers would only look around the feet of the accused for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.203" offset="4884146">Now, the State of Louisiana feels that this emergency situation is so similar to the one that existed to Schmerber for instance or in Warden versus Hayden and we can't see the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.668" offset="4934092">Of course in Schmerber it involved a blood sample and in Warden versus Hayden it involved burglary -- fruits of the burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.692" offset="4974111">But nevertheless, the basic situation is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.552" offset="4989576">The police officers are faced with a situation in which they’ve got to act quickly or the evidence they are going to seize is not going to be there anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.348" offset="5036805">They're faced with this situation and narcotic evidence disappears just as rapidly as does alcohol in the blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.088" offset="5079751">Not only that, I’d like to point out to this Court that if police officers can't make searches for narcotics such as existed in the present case, they can't really ever seize this evidence because how would they able to get a search warrant for instance although -- no, let's say the police officer is like in the present case knew that Donald Vale was operating from four or five different addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.638" offset="5169925">Now, supposing they had gone to -- had made out a search warrant about six of them, four or five addresses, one for his car, one for his person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.584" offset="5205661">All simultaneous and taking him to a criminal district court judge all residing probable cause to believe that this particular warrant were discovered would turn out narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.660" offset="5245994">The judges signed them all then he had gone around and executed all these warrants and one of them that had found narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.475" offset="5273266">It seems to me that the accused, all he had to do is go and say, how could you have probable cause for this one warrant when you sign -- when you got that five others and you really didn’t know where it was did you and no you didn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.764" offset="5326451">And how do you know where the narcotic evidence is in the case like this where this guy -- these people are very smart and they jump around and they change where they keep the narcotic hoard on the person and the car in different place.</text>
