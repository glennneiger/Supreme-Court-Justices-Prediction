            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="142.940" offset="675088">I think that was left open in Rosado.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.134" offset="683865">I think the situation in this Court in Rosado however was that the petitioners there had relief before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.912" offset="723048">Here petitioners come into this Court, relief having been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.281" offset="740498">We take the position that that relief is no more than an order of compliance with the federal standard which in our view New York is in any event obligated to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.765" offset="782399">We believe that petitioners have made the showing, a sufficient showing that New York is out of compliance with that standard to justify such an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.809" offset="818657">It leaves free to New York the choice which this Court said New York must have in Rosado, that is the choice of withdrawing entirely from the federal program.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.655" offset="862020">And then the point I wanted to make them the basis of the statute is that New York has in fact made that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.368" offset="888874">In the statute the legislature said and I’m quoting at line nine of the first page, if you have it there, “The legislature hereby declares its intent to make provision for the state to meet all necessary federal requirements under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.106" offset="951777">And again at line three, “It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Social Services shall determine and establish the standards of need for public assistance in this state in conformity with federal requirements.”</text>
            <text syncTime="225.691" offset="1006111">And again, within the adopted amended Section 131 (a) itself on page 4 at line twelve, “If federal requirements make it necessary to adjust any schedule of grants and allowances or part thereof, the department shall make such adjustments.”</text>
            <text syncTime="245.383" offset="1084897">So that I think New York’s judgment in this case is entirely clear and as we set out in the rather long footnote of the end of our amicus brief, is the judgment in which all states of the union have essentially concurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.334" offset="1148740">And there was also the question yesterday and I think this goes back to what I was trying to say during the short time I had then, “Why was the Government had put as part of its question presented, whether the New York State plan improperly favors residents of New York City over residents of other areas of the state,” and this goes I think to the heart of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.981" offset="1251244">The impropriety is not in itself in the payment of more money in New York City than New York State, but as I was trying to state yesterday in considering that residents of New York State need services, need goods, need items which are not under any circumstances made available to residents of any other part of the state even though their need for those items might equally be made the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.630" offset="1373915">And it seems to us that this is directly inconsistent with the statute, with the provision of the statute which in both cases, Section 602 (a) and Section 1382 (a) provides that a state plan for aid and services must provide that it shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the state and if administered by the subdivisions must be mandatory upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.201" offset="1500139">And it has been since the beginning of the act to the departments understanding and interpretation that that means that you cannot say within a state the people in part of the state are entitled to goods and services, I’m not talking about amounts of money at this point, entitled the goods and services to accounting for those goods and services which people in another part of the state simply have no access too.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.183" offset="1700133">But in New York City, for example there are subways, that’s the way people get back and forth and every -- anybody, most people who live uptown or work downtown, live in Harlem, work in midtown have to use those subways and as in a little town up right Alexandria Bay, you walk.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.754" offset="1774425">I don’t see how this can be worked out uniformly because there is a need for a service in New York City that does not exist in Redwood or Alexandria Bay.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.887" offset="1910888">I think New York City is the only city in the state that has a subway system and where that the people have to use it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="459.468" offset="1941295">Well, suppose it comes down to how particular judgment you were to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.866" offset="1958849">As I understand the New York standard of need, the list of basic needs which New York State recognizes claims to recognize in its standard of need doesn’t include any allowance for transportation, that is at page 47 of the appendix, food, clothing, personal incidentals, household supplies, school expenses, utilities, laundries and sales taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.435" offset="2069086">Now, it is certainly our position that New York State could if it felt it was necessary to the residents of that state make provision for transportation expenses to take your example.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.861" offset="2118823">And it could do so either on a basic need basis, or on a special need basis, I think the Court is familiar with that difference from Rosado.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.076" offset="2167724">If it does on a basic needs basis, that means that the cost is to be figured in to the flat ground for every resident of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.463" offset="2205236">In figuring that cost, the state has the option of doing it on an average basis or doing it on a local regional basis, and if they did it on a local regional basis, I would certainly agree that the amount for New York City would quite possibly be higher than the amount for other parts of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.288" offset="2276498">From the evidence of the record it might also be lower than let’s say Nassau County.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.214" offset="2420276">And the federal standard I’m talking about is the requirement that in deciding what it is its public assistance beneficiaries required, the state must reach this decision on a uniform, statewide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.025" offset="2491434">It may cost it on a local basis, but the legislature cannot make the judgment and it is not simply a disagreement of judgment, it’s a question of consistency.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.601" offset="2873762">There are three situations in which HEW does recognize cost variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.687" offset="2902079">They’re all provided for in these regulations which begin at 34 Federal Register 1394 and which we cite in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.464" offset="2937187">And the first of them is the California situation in which the state establishes a standard of need on a statewide basis, but is unable to pay the total amount of that standard applies a ratable reduction or it applies a maximum, so that there’s a gap between need on the one hand and actual payments on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.578" offset="3013674">In that situation, any local subdivision may fill the gap and that’s what some of the California subdivisions do.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.642" offset="3041991">They may make payments between the level of state payments and the level of need as determined by the state under its uniform standard, and those payments will not be counted as income of the recipient and therefore do go to supplement the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.300" offset="3104580">Now, of course those payments aren’t subject to federal matching, the local subdivisions receive no funds for the federal -- from the Federal Government for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.602" offset="3137808">The second situation is a situation in which New York City, let us say determined that its residents needed transportation and there was no provision in the New York State standard of need for transportation as there is now, New York City could then provide those services which weren’t provided for in the state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.895" offset="3222967">And again there would be no conformity issue, and there would no reduction of payments but again New York City’s payments for transportation would be not matched by federal payments, there would be no federal funds involved in that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1060.579" offset="4345710">I think the short answer to Mr. Strauss’ argument about albeit the District Court started of on the wrong foot, why don’t we simply take it the other way and affirm the injunction anyway because they’re probably right about the statutory ground as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.236" offset="4404328">The short answer to that is that the sweeping injunctions that were granted below aren’t supported by the statutory ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.364" offset="4428779">And this Court’s decision in Rosado makes that clear because what the Court did below was issue an injunction against enforcement of the statute at all unless it were corrected and objectives -- what they thought were objective standards were imposed, which would have been a valid injunction under the Equal Protection Clause assuming a violation of that clause had been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.337" offset="4516760">The language is, other -- they’re enjoined from enforcing this statute at all other than according to objective, non-discriminatory standards based upon the cost of the needs of such recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.223" offset="4564302">Now, a statutory nonconformity as in Rosado doesn’t support any such injunction, and indeed this Court, Rosado made that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.025" offset="4603486">The most that could be done there would be a remand to the District Court to what -- assuming that the probabilities were that the HEW is right and we were wrong about the statutory argument, the most that could be done would be to remand the case of District Court for a much more narrow injunction such as the one this Court discussed in Rosado.</text>
