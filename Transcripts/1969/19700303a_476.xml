            <text syncTime="22.219" offset="192240">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.387" offset="204884">What is involved here is a determination of the status of charging parties under Section 10 (l) of the Act, specifically, whether they have standing to appeal denial of temporary injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.027" offset="279489">Section 10 (l) of the Act is an extraordinary remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.599" offset="305716">It provides whenever it is charge that any person has engaged in an unfair labor practice within the meaning of Section 8 (b) (4) (A) (B) and (C), and specifically here that charging party is a neutral employer in a charge involving violations of Section 8 (b) (4) (B), the secondary boycott provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.381" offset="400906">So the charging party is one of the person's contemplated for protection under Section 10 (l).</text>
            <text syncTime="80.991" offset="427342">Statute then goes on to say the preliminary investigation of such charge shall be made forthwith and be given priority over all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.626" offset="465899">In this particular case Sears Roebuck, the petitioner filed a charge with the NLRB, and the NLRB proceeded to make such investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.485" offset="509262">Statute then goes on to say if after such investigation, the officer or Regional Attorney to whom the matter may be refer has reasonable cause to believe such charge is true, and that a complaint should issue, he shall on behalf of the Board, petition a District Court for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.408" offset="597034">In this particular case, the Regional Director for the NLRB in Denver made such a finding of reasonable cause, and he follow the statutory mandate and sought injunctive relief in the District Court of the District of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.564" offset="665579">It is our position that the charging party or neutral -- a neutral party such as Sears is in this case is the very person whom Congress when it enacted, not only the 8 (b) (4) provisions, the secondary boycott provision at the time of Taft-Hartley, but also Section 10 (l), the mandatory requirement that the Government seek injunctive relief is the party for whose benefit, in addition of course to the public a benefit, for whose benefit the relief is being sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.771" offset="1002454">But it is our contention and we will demonstrate to this Court as we believe we have in our briefs that in reading -- in looking to the entire scheme of the Act, in other words, the role, the charging party's play in the Board proceeding because the same charge which Sears Roebuck here filed gave rise to two proceedings, and gave rise to two concurrent actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.925" offset="1091062">In fact it happens in this case, they were on the same day, although, they need them to bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.735" offset="1106317">In this particular case, the Regional Director issued an unfair labor practice complaint alleging that the Carpet Layers respondent union here was violating or he had reasonable cause to believe that the respondent union was violating the secondary boycott provisions of the Act, and similarly, filed a petition for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.031" offset="1183535">Those two cases are still very much alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.741" offset="1206314">And the Regional Director at all times, critical to our contention here has continued to maintain that reasonable belief or reasonable cause to believe that the union has violated the law or was in the process of violating the law.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <label>Mr. Gerard C. Smetana</label>
            <text syncTime="314.569" offset="1361690">Yes, I'm sure he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.991" offset="1367333">Well, essentially on the mootness question, very briefly, the major position that we would take with respect to mootness is that as a matter of policy, the issues involved -- that the orders involved here are short-term orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.274" offset="1440475">Specifically, injunctive relief under Section 10 (l) of the Act is the kind of relief that normally expires because the dispute is resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.774" offset="1478510">And so that if there are some problem with respect to the correctness of the standing of parties in that proceeding, this Court would never have an opportunity to resolve that question if it were to wait -- if it could not do so at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.915" offset="1547055">And so under the doctrine of the Southern Pacific Terminal case and more recently as this Court said last year in the Moore versus Ogilvie, these are important public questions that will come up again, and that should -- that are not rendered moot because of the continuing effect not only upon Sears in this case and another cases, but other parties similarly situated and would escape review but for the mootness doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.322" offset="1652694">Therefore, the mootness doctrine would be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.097" offset="1663770">We also contend that the case is not factually moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.394" offset="1676936">We say it is not factually moot because for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.066" offset="1699610">Specifically that as in the -- as in Bakery Drivers versus Wagshal, the union here to the extent that it has stop picketing what whatever we can infer from that, we can only infer that it did stop picketing pursuant to an order of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.065" offset="1759587">And more specifically, the union maintains the correctness of its position and has so argued that correctness of its position, January 22nd this year in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit maintaining that it believes and continues to believe that the picketing of Sears Roebuck was not violative of Section 8 (b) (4) so that so long as this controversy and the underlying dispute remains, there is still the possibility that the picketing will resume, and that possibility would come about, should the District of Columbia Circuit where the -- and what happened here in the underlying cases that the Trial Examiner and the Board found the union to have violated Section 8 (b) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="455.502" offset="1925413">The union moved the District of Columbia Circuit to review that decision and the Sears Roebuck intervened and the Board cross petition for enforcement of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.674" offset="1974105">And in the event, the District of Columbia Circuit remands to the Board there are number of possibilities as to what can arise in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.190" offset="2008168">Should there be a remand, it is our contention that there is also then the possibility of a renewal of picketing because there may be some question as to something further the Board might have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.283" offset="2052472">In any event, so far as the factual mootness, it is our further contention that the language of the statute, so far as the time during which the injunctive provision runs.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.137" offset="2119868">In other words, in Section 10 (l), Section 10 (l) states that the injunction -- that the court shall grant such injunctive relief pending final adjudication of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.880" offset="2162918">So, there is another question although it is perhaps not necessary for the Court to resolve that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.719" offset="2186219">If it resolves the question of mootness on the Southern Pacific Terminal and Moore versus Ogilvie line of cases, it is perhaps not necessary to reach the question of interpretation of those words pending final adjudication of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.907" offset="2235016">But it is our position that pending final adjudication of the Board means when the matter has finally been resolved by the Board and that a settlement will be a final resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.594" offset="2289768">In this case, we contend that it has not been finally been resolved by the Board because of the possibility of the remand, because in that situation, the Board would have to do the something further, and we recognized the fact that there is a final Board order here from which the union appeals the statutory language is not clear, but we would contend that that is the meaning of the words final adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.387" offset="2376913">We have no authority other than logic and reason to support that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.580" offset="2449742">Our argument -- before I pass on to the argument, I should briefly summarize any facts that I have in my opening remarks not alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.205" offset="2504182">In this particular case, the picketing and the picketing of Sears Roebuck continued for a period of 10 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.503" offset="2549426">There was -- the argument Your Honor essentially falls into two or three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.275" offset="2588505">Our major contention is that the scheme of the Act as this Court has consider the scheme of the Act in its Scofield decision renders that charging parties should have the right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.206" offset="2652244">The reason for -- specifically, what we would urge under the scheme of the Act is that charging parties possess the very rights that are set forth in Section 10 (l).</text>
            <text syncTime="649.850" offset="2702817">They possess those identical rights and are treated as parties in the Board proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.929" offset="2723088">And therefore, they should be similarly be treated as parties in the Section 10 (l) proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.999" offset="2743359">We would then also allude to the guidance that the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act can give with respect to the question of charging party rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.476" offset="2789230">When we say that we are party, we use the word party with three specific exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.562" offset="2817651">So, there is no mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.718" offset="2822248">We do not say we are the kind of juridical party that one is outside is the framework of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.467" offset="2849207">We say first, that we do not seek injunctive relief in Section 10 (l), but rather we simply support that which director has done.</text>

            <text syncTime="715.502" offset="2965400">Just to recap for one moment with respect to the -- how this case arises and how the appeal comes to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.299" offset="3000613">When the District Court for the District of Colorado denied the injunctive relief which the Regional Director had sought, and it was in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.097" offset="3039796">The charging party Sears, the respondent union, and the Board all appeared by counsel and all participated as provided in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.954" offset="3079189">The District Court justice -- judge held that there was little probability that the Board would find a violation of law, and therefore denied the injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.375" offset="3132897">After this decision, the Regional Director continued in his belief that there was in fact reasonable cause to believe that a violation existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.680" offset="3166124">We had -- we attempted to convince the Regional Director to seek and to appeal from the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.899" offset="3214921">That request and those request were without avail, and as a time for filing appeal drew near faced with the continued picketing of Sears at its Denver locations faced with the Director's continued belief there was a violation and with the Director's refusal to file an appeal, we on behalf of the charging party filed an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.039" offset="3315545">There were then motions to dismiss that appeal for lack of standing filed both by the Board and by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.444" offset="3349191">I should add there was one further intervening factor which perhaps has some significance to some of the arguments that have been raised by the counsel for the Regional Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.545" offset="3401540">After the appeal had been filed, the Trial Examiner who heard the facts of the underlying case in the first instance came down with a favorable decision for Sears.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.307" offset="3444590">He found that there was reasonable cause to believe the secondary boycott section of the Act had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.385" offset="3476877">It was within a few days of that decision that we again wrote to the general counsel and requested two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.119" offset="3511881">We requested first, that perhaps the general counsel, since the picketing was still continuing, would seek injunctive relief under the discretionary section, Section 10 (j) of the Act, and admittedly, we were aware of no case which permitted were the Board had gone for injunctive relief under Section 10 (j), even though this was an area that was covered by 10 (l), but the language of the Act would lead one to believe that it was possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.729" offset="3610311">We ask secondly of the Board once more that they join us in the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.260" offset="3628387">The Board responded within the few days indicating that they did not choose to file for 10 (j) relief, even if that was available and furthermore, they did not seek to join us in the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.322" offset="3680632">The only reason they gave was at the time for them to join us in the appeal had disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.572" offset="3705710">I think that exchange of letters only has become significant and we have mentioned in our reply brief in view of the Board's -- one of the Board's contentions here, that -- and that same contention made below that if the charging party were to be given the right of appeal and were to be given party rights subject to the limitations which I've started to outline before the luncheon break, that would amount to the Board's losing control.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.291" offset="3840502">And the particular -- and the Board speaks of control in a number of instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.371" offset="3860877">There was one kind of control which the Board's speaks of in the case before the District Court, and there's another kind of control the Board addresses itself to with respect to the decision whether or not it should appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.918" offset="3927019">Now, with respect to the first kind of control, I had started to say that there are -- what we contended are, we have rights of a party subject to three limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.623" offset="3981876">The first is that we do not seek the injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.811" offset="3998595">We simply support that which the Board has done, and we take to position that once the Regional Director has filed his petition for injunctive relief by virtue of the language in the statute, giving us the right to be heard, we have the right to support that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.139" offset="4071946">And we have -- we relied in the Tenth Circuit upon the Retail Clerk's case, the Ninth Circuit Retail Clerk's case, and we would contend that the reasoning of that court with respect to this question is indeed sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.944" offset="4131192">The second limitation that we would say would afford to a charging party is the fact that the charging party at no time may enlarge or urge an enlargement of the positions taken by the Director in the petitioner that he filed with the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.839" offset="4210709">And it is for that reason that we would distinguished the decision that Justice Marshall then -- Judge Marshall rendered in the Second Circuit in the McLeod case because it was -- in that case, and the Board and the union have cited the McLeod case as proposition for the fact that charging party should not be granted this right because it's violative of Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.679" offset="4302137">And in the McLeod case as in -- that whole line of cases, it is clear that where the charging party enlarges upon something which the Director seeking in the McLeod case, the charging party was urging that there was some handbilling in that case and the charging of party was urging that there was some misrepresentation with respect to the handbilling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.256" offset="4392417">And the court concluded that the question of misrepresentation was not one of the basis upon which the Board had sought its petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.443" offset="4425122">And therefore to the extent that the charging party was urging a different result, to that extent, there could be a violation of Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.030" offset="4467440">Finally, with respect -- and the District Court -- the Tenth Circuit in this case dismissed or granted the Board and union's motion to dismiss for lack of standing on essentially three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.935" offset="4519163">First that the relief here would constitute a violation of Norris-LaGuardia and they contend the reason for that is in effect, they would be granting injunctive relief to a charging party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.935" offset="4571094">Secondly, the case that we cite and cited to them and cited in our brief, the Ninth Circuit Retail Clerks case, the Tenth Circuit took the position that that case really only refer to the rights of charging parties in the District Court, and therefore was not apposite or helpful to them in determining whether or not we would have standing to appeal and have any rights in the Courts of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.309" offset="4652596">And finally, the Tenth Circuit took the position that the statutory language that charging parties shall be represented by counsel and present relevant testimony means that and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.387" offset="4700871">Now, with respect to the last, perhaps first, whether the language means that and no more, we would then turn to the first, what part of our argument, and we would say that the scheme of the Act, the fact that charging parties, the same party who is before the District Court in the 10 (l) proceeding also proceeds in the case before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.778" offset="4806510">And in that Board case, it is true that the charging party is referred to as a party, but the scheme of the Act as this Court had held in Scofield, the court looks to the overall concern and the overall concern in this Act is the protection of charging party rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.138" offset="4879966">And particularly here, there is even a stronger protection with respect to the neutral in an 8 (b) (4) situation where there is a mandatory requirement to seek relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.187" offset="4916120">But in the Board proceeding, the charging party participates at all levels in the investigation, in the issuance of complaint, in settlement, in hearings, appeals and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.447" offset="5621112">We would contend that the charging party has the right as it did -- as the court found in the Ninth Circuit case to urge to the court that there is fact reasonable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1532.568" offset="6233631">In our reply brief, we cited the court, call the court's attention to some of the deliberations that occurred in the 79th Congress, because it is only by looking to that background that we see the light in which the court was -- the Congress was concerned with private party rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.901" offset="6298937">At that time, two things were clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.417" offset="6309073">It was clear that the Congress was concerned with protecting neutrals, and the secondary boycott provisions were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.910" offset="6334986">It was also clear that what it transpired between the enactment of Norris-LaGuardia and the Wagner Act and up till that time was unsatisfactory in terms of getting injunctive protection where there was a neutral or where there was a wrong party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.598" offset="6389739">Prior to the enactment of Taft-Hartley, the Board would first have to make a determination on the merits where there was a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.972" offset="6415235">And one of the purposes was that there would be a prior determination but that prior determination has the statute finally evolved was to be only upon decision by the Regional Director where there was a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.269" offset="6468420">But in the 79th Congress, the Case Bill passed both Houses and that Bill provided that private parties as well as the Board could seek injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.372" offset="6564864">Immediately at the convening of the 80th Congress, a Bill almost identical to the Case Bill was introduced in the Senate, which is Bill S.55, and it was on that Bill that hearings were held in the Senate Labor Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.981" offset="6611257">At the same time in the House, there was a Bill which passed identical to the Case Bill again giving rights to private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.544" offset="6641560">It became clear however to -- certainly to Senator Taft that if there was going to either be no veto, and if there was going to getting legislation, there had to be some compromise, and time was of the essence the -- that Government was operating the minds as the Smith-Connolly Act was going to expire in a few months, and Senator Taft was the one who is to compromiser, and the evidence of his compromise specifically with respect to the question of private party rights and private party rights with respect to the issuance of temporary injunctions comes from the procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.733" offset="6770291">S.55 as I say was in the Senate Labor Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.608" offset="6781785">Out of that Committee was -- came a Committee Report and a new Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.436" offset="6797145">The new Bill was called in the 88th Congress S.1126.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.201" offset="6816162">And so far as Section 10 (l) was concerned and so far as the rights of charging parties are concerned, the words I referred to they appeared for the first time in S.1126, and subsequently have remained unchanged in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.503" offset="6873422">However, when it was reported out of Committee, Senator Taft, Senator Ball, Senator O'Daniel and one other Senator, all indicated that they would reserve the right on the Floor of the Senate to again introduce once more an amendment to permit private parties to institute these rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.877" offset="6946879">Because they were concerned that the private party was the aggrieved party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.076" offset="6959626">The private party was the one who should be protected and they were concerned that perhaps the Board wouldn't afford sufficient protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.029" offset="6991496">When and although Senator Taft, at the time that it was reported out of Committee, still favored private party rights shortly when the debates began on the Floor of the Senate and we've cited that in the briefs, he changed his position, and the schism came when Senator Ball was the one who introduced the amendment for a private party rights again on the Floor of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.622" offset="7085850">Senator Taft at that point said that he could not go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.980" offset="7103300">He would offer another compromise, and that the -- if the Act was to be passed, it would have to be passed without the rights of private party seeking that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.854" offset="7138826">And therefore, I say that since there was such concern with the rights of private parties, the words of Section 10 (l) should not be read narrowly as the Board suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.588" offset="7177697">But rather they should be given broader interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1810.694" offset="7346134">There is this and I didn't cite it specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.413" offset="7357001">The case in the Second Circuit that I think has most bearing on this subject is the McLeod versus the Business and Mechanics Conference case, I believe it was a 1961 case, and that was the case where the decision was written by Judge Marshall -- Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.000" offset="7415411">And in that situation, I recited the case briefly for another proposition with respect to the charging party taking a position not urge by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.111" offset="7459819">But the interesting thing about that case is that the charging party was there at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.939" offset="7479150">I mean the charging party in that proceeding and we did not intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.604" offset="7497749">The charging party in that proceeding was there as a party, and the charging party argued as a party and there was no -- that although the court was silent with respect to that status, perhaps the question wasn't' raised, but certainly inferentially, that case would seem to go along with the position of the Ninth Circuit, although Ninth Circuit came much later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.310" offset="7576639">I would call the Court's attention to another interesting factor in the Ninth Circuit decision, and that is the -- the Ninth Circuit in its decision -- the Ninth Circuit in its decision set forth certain headings, and while the Tenth Circuit tries to distinguished the case with respect to saying the case only stands for the proposition that -- it is question of the court's jurisdiction whether or not injunctive relief would be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.439" offset="7717177">In reality, the headings that I've reference to it, it is rather unusual to see specific headings said to an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.049" offset="7747584">All of the discussion with respect to charging party rights is in heading Roman numeral II, and it is an uppercase, and it says to whom was the temporary injunction granted?</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.070" offset="7791679">And that's at 351 F.2d 528.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.051" offset="7803591">We have cited the case, but not made specific reference to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.442" offset="7817174">And the court drew a distinction between on the one hand discussing the charging party rights, and on the other hand discussing the question of its own authority for when it was talking about its own authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.416" offset="7865031">The heading is “allege abuse of discretion” and talking about the fact that the Board they're appealed and claim that the court had abused its discretion when it granted the injunction because the Board orders that the injunction had been granted to the charge of parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.263" offset="7944443">I would call the Court's attention to the Scofield case, insofar as it sheds light on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.723" offset="7966281">I think the general concept -- I think the position of the Board and the union and the court has been Scofield is to be read narrowly, and we of course take the position that Scofield stands more than just for the proposition, the question of multiplicity of suits that occurred in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.192" offset="8032110">Scofield stands for the proposition that it recognizes private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.276" offset="8048515">In fact for the concept of recognition of private rights, this Court cited the Ninth Circuit Retail Clerks case which had earlier reached a same conclusion and the court spoke in terms general fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.695" offset="8094177">The court recognized also that the status of the amicus was not status enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.172" offset="9660061">Well, my recollection was that it was just that that was the union who appeal in that case and then we went in there to defend our own position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.610" offset="9693811">And whatever, whatever may be said of that case Your Honor, I do want to call attention to the latest decision of the Court of Appeals of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in which they said, in which it said that although the question of the charging party standing to appeal was broached in the Retail Clerks case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.235" offset="9776358">They nevertheless had now concluded that the charging party does not have the status of a party, of a full party where the right of appeal and they've lined up for the Tenth Circuit in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.657" offset="9825991">Now, if I may get back now for a moment to develop my argument with respect to the contentions of the petitioner, the petitioner's case that a charging party in a 10 (l) proceedings is entitled to seek to appeal from an adverse decision of the District Court independently of the Regional Director, it seems to me rest essentially upon the predicate -- upon the predicate that a charging party with certain qualifications that the petitioner here has indicated as a status of a full party in those proceeding -- in those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.767" offset="9994428">Now, it seems to us that that predicate, that predicate misconceives the statutory scheme and also fails to accord proper way to the legislative history that gave birth to Section 10 (l).</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.970" offset="10059212">In our view, under the statute, a charging party plays a subordinate role in a 10 (l) proceedings in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.785" offset="10106546">It's -- Congress vested upon the charging party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.783" offset="10122533">The limited role of assisting and aiding in the course of the prosecution of the case by the Regional Director, but that it is the Regional Director who contains or retains control not only over the initiation, not only over the initiation of the proceedings in the District Court, but also retains control of the litigation at all stages both the appellate -- both the trial stages, as well as the appellate stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.539" offset="10237576">Now, Section 10 (l) represents one of the many compromises that is to be found in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.211" offset="10268191">And as in the case of other labor act compromises which have engage the attention of this Court, the meaning of Section 10 (l) and the role which a charging party was to play in the proceedings can only be fully determined by going back to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.191" offset="10348126">I think it's not wholly amiss to say that in the case like this, a page of legislative history does outweigh a book of logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.300" offset="10388564">Section 10 (l) became a part of the Act as Mr. Smetana has indicated in 1947 when Congress adopted the Taft-Hartley amendments, including the restrictions against secondary boycotts and strikes over jurisdictional disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.113" offset="10479783">In the course of that delay, Congress took note of the fact that the administrative unfair labor practice proceedings before the Board where unduly and unavoidably time-consuming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.801" offset="10530565">And for that reason, it was felt that in the speedier remedy was required in the public interest rather than a Board order or a court decree enforcing that Board order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.713" offset="10582183">The debate over the need and the means for achieving this kind of speedy relief was particularly acute in the area of secondary boycotts as jurisdictional disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.660" offset="10634010">The Senate Labor Committee had reported a Bill which contained a provision virtually identical with Section 10 (l) of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2664.964" offset="10763264">They were critical of the Section 10 (l) provision which was contained in the Senate Bill, the Bill that have been reported by the Senate Committee because he felt that it was inadequate, wholly inadequate to give an employer who is involved in the secondary dispute, or was involved in the jurisdictional disputes that kind of speedy relief, that kind of relief that they thought he was entire -- entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.118" offset="10863888">They were critical of the Senate Committee Bill because as Senators Ball, Taft, and O'Daniel said in their supplemental views -- their supplemental views to the Senate Labor Committee's Report.</text>

            <text syncTime="2887.388" offset="11652890">Now, if you permit the charging party, if you permit the charging party to say, well, independently taken appeal despite the failure of the Regional Director to take an appeal, in effect what you've done, you transformed -- you transformed what is a Government piece, Government litigation into a private, into a private lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.498" offset="11737318">And indeed, indeed the petitioner in its brief, I think almost virtually concedes at that point almost becomes a private lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.914" offset="11766993">Now, to be sure -- to be sure that petitioner is arguing -- the petitioner is arguing that it is confined to the theory of the case originally advanced by the Regional Director and that is confined also to the kind of relief that the Regional Director is asking but I suggest Your Honor that once the Regional Director is out of the picture, and the charging party is permitted to go ahead and take an appeal that then it truly has become a private piece of litigation rather than a Government litigation and Congress, and Congress did not intend to permit that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3150.948" offset="12707192">Well, if I may go on a little bit more here with this legislative history because I think it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.728" offset="12730284">This legislative history and I can only touch the highlights of it to indicate what the scope of the debate and the intensiveness of the debate as to who was going to be in charge of this particular litigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.946" offset="12779186">And Senator O'Daniel on the Floor of the Senate, I've already read from the supplemental views of Senators Taft and Ball and Senator O'Daniel on the Floor of the Senate, he said, he saw no reason under heaven why the decision to seek injunctive relief and control of the litigation should be exclusively vested in a Board representative rather than an injured party and the Senator Wherry added, the injured party and I want to quote this, “should not have to depend upon the judgment of some bureaucrat in whom it lies the power to determine why such a course should be followed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.696" offset="12914186">And again they strongly urged to Senator O'Daniel that the injured parties should have and I want to quote this once more, “should have the right to control its own litigation, to hire its own lawyer, to take such steps as it deems proper and to go into such Court as it deems proper to proceed in.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.306" offset="12992554">Now, to achieve this purpose, Senator Ball introduced his amendment and under his amendment, he introduced the amendment on the Floor of the Senate under his amendment, the charge -- a party who was suffering from a secondary boycott or a jurisdictional dispute strike would have the right independently to go into a District Court and obtain injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.899" offset="13087013">That proposal encountered strong opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.977" offset="13103313">Some members of the opposition were unwilling to permit injunctions whether at the request of private parties or at the request of the other Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.039" offset="13139571">But the opposition was subtlety and I might say, they vehemently opposed to any provision that would permit a private party to go and seek an injunctive relief in these kind -- in these type of cases because -- because they feared a revival, a resurrection of some of the evils that had led to Norris-la-Guardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.023" offset="13227447">They were willing -- they were willing to relax the restriction of Norris-la-Guardia only if, only if the exclusive authority to initiate and to control the litigation at 10 (l) proceeding was vested in the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.624" offset="13297873">Now, the difference between the two groups was taken care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.609" offset="13333817">It was taken -- it was resolved through a compromise that Senator Taft proposed as a substitute, as a substitute for the Ball amendment which would have given a private party the right to independently go into a District Court and get an injunction as the substitute for that, Senator Taft proposed what is now Section 303 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.161" offset="13423992">And Section 303 of the Act permits an injured party to go into a Court in order to get damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.748" offset="13458369">The Ball amendment was overwhelmingly defeated by a vote of something like 62 to 28 and Section 10 (l) of course was retained in its present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.309" offset="13536632">And Senator Taft after the Conference Committee had approved Section 10 (l) and Section 303 provision of the statute explained that compromise Senator Taft said that under that compro -- under his proposal, the compromise which had been accepted, the injured party was given “simply a right of suit for damages” caused by secondary boycotts or jurisdiction disputes but that in such cases, again I want to quote, “the injunction can be obtained only through the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.107" offset="13683754">I think what emerges from this legislative history is that Congress agreed to a narrow exceptions of Norris-la-Guardia which vested the exclusive jurisdiction in the Board or the Regional Director, I used the terms interchangeably, which vested exclusively control in the Board over the -- not only the initiation but the control of the litigation at all stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.419" offset="13781034">The private party, the injured party was given simply the right to sue for damages and in Section 10 (l), in Section 10 (l), Congress assigned a subordinate role to the charging party of merely aiding and assisting in the conduct of the 10 (l) proceedings by the Regional Director, but it was the Regional Director who remained in control and as I said earlier, the fight between the proponents of the Ball amendment and the -- and those who opposed it was not simply a fight where who is going to have control over the initiation of the proceedings, the fight went much deeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.726" offset="13946232">The fight was who would be in control of that kind of litigation, the injured party or the Board?</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.742" offset="13974340">And Congress answered that question firmly in favor of the Board and I believe that its action indicates that Congress withheld from the charging party the status of a -- of a party, the status of a party.</text>

            <text syncTime="3531.630" offset="14229922">They were fearful, they were fearful to give the charging party any kind of an independent right, independent right to press for and to seek an injunction or to press for injunction and as I said earlier, if the Regional Director concludes after he has carried out the mandated duty of going into a District Court, that in the face of that adverse decision and because of other considerations I'll spell out in a moment, he concludes that it's no longer appropriate to seek injunctive or to press for injunctive relief then the charging party has taken charge of that litigation and it seems to me that the kind of control that Congress was talking about would have -- would exclude, would exclude the charging party from going on upstairs and seeking to press for an injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="4089.655" offset="16462033">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.775" offset="16478438">Mr. Justice Stewart, the Food Employers Council case in so far as its decision is concerned is not in conflict with the position we take in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.046" offset="16515532">The decision was that despite the fact that the Regional Director might have preferred a settlement and thereby a dismissal of the petition, he could not tie the hands of the District Court in so far as the discretion of that Court is concerned in fashioning the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.438" offset="16577076">That is not in conflict with the position we take.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.532" offset="16593481">The dictum in Food Employers Council is in conflict with the position we take and the dictum was eliminated for all intents and purposes in the Henderson case which Mr. Manoli referred to where they denied the right to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.979" offset="16655339">The statute if it please the Court is not silent on the question of the role of the charging party and in fact, the language includes more than just the rights of the charging party but the role of all other persons involved in the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.513" offset="16725452">It says, upon the filing of any such petition, the Court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon any person involved in the charge, and such person including the charging party shall be given an opportunity to appear by counsel and present any relevant testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.372" offset="16800893">That means that what we're talking about in this case is not only the appeal rights, the independent appeal rights of the charging party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.216" offset="16832240">But we're also talking about the independent appeal rights of all the primary and secondary employers in every secondary boycott case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.356" offset="16864841">For example, in this case, Joe and Eddie's Carpet Service, if Sears is allowed to appeal, it would also be allowed to independently appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.278" offset="16900472">And so would under this language every other primary and secondary employer involved under Section 10 (l) because of its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.403" offset="16936939">So, it's important to realize that we're talking here about more than just a charging party's role; we're talking about these other persons' roles as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.886" offset="16974869">The language to appear by counsel and present any relevant testimony is language of limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4346.931" offset="17491048">I would like to say that -- that quite apart from what may be said in those decisions, I don't know if you had in those decisions the limiting language that you have here with regard to simply the right to present a relevant testimony to appear by counsel and present a relevant testimony when viewed in light of the fact that Congress used the word party and knew how to use it not only in this same Section but in Sections 10 (c) and (e) and particularly in light of the statutory scheme whereby the Board only empowered to seek injunctions under Section 10 (l), to institute injunctive proceedings under 10 (j), to seek interim relief in the Courts of Appeals under 10 (e) and (f) and even under 10 (f), Mr. Chief Justice where the aggrieved party is the party that appeals, the interim relief can be afforded to the Board and not to the party that appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.025" offset="17731480">So that, not only the language but the statutory scheme is evidence, is evidence that Congress intended those words to limit the role of a charging party as well as the other persons involved in the charge and of course the legislative history as far as we are concerned is absolutely compelling because both Senator Ellender, strong supporter of S.1126 and Senator Taft, its chief sponsor had to rise and make statements to the effect that they strongly feared what would happen if private litigants were given access to the injunctive process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.692" offset="17890095">What would happen to the remainder of the legislation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.161" offset="17903992">They thought, they'd lose it and so they have to give up the notion that control of the litigation could be vested in the private litigants and there was no question in the debates of the Ball amendment that what they were talking about was not just the right to initiate a suit but as Mr. Manoli correctly pointed out, the right to control litigation and what evolved -- what evolved from the legislative process after a lengthy and very emotional debates on this very point not on the point of appeal, but on the point of the role of charging parties was essentially a compromise just as in much of the other labor legislation that we have on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.767" offset="18074415">But it's important to understand the nature of that compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.983" offset="18091342">The compromise was not ambiguous language leaving it up to the courts for interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.995" offset="18115375">The compromise was that there would be a Section 303 rights on the part of employers to sue unions for damages in the event of secondary boycotts, that the proponents of the Bill would also have the benefit of a mandatory injunction under Section 10 (l).</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.154" offset="18179950">It wasn't discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.561" offset="18189667">And incidentally, unions don't have a similar right to the right given employers under Section 303, unions don't have the benefit of any mandatory injunction as employers do under Section 10 (l) and in return for that, in return for those protections, the proponents of the strong bill had to give up the notion that private litigants could control Section 10 (l) litigation and that limiting language was fashioned as a part of that compromise.</text>

            <text syncTime="5102.013" offset="20511431">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.075" offset="20519685">I should first like to point out in response to union counsel's argument that unions also are beneficiaries under Section 10 (l).</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.438" offset="20561168">They in a number of cases, in an 8 (e) situation where there's a Hot Cargo case which the Ninth Circuit Retail Clerks case, it was the union who was the charging party and it was the union who was seeking to appeal and so that the unions in those situations as well an 8 (b) (4) (a) situation where the attempt to enforce of coercively enforce illegal 8 (d) contract and also in 8 (b) (4) (d), the construction industry jurisdictional cases, the union is the charging party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.019" offset="20675480">Secondly, so far as the cases have decided the appellate review, the union counsel suggests that they have all given charging party only amicus status.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.519" offset="20717484">I would suggest, Your Honors that this is the first case where the issue has a reason where the -- it involves a charging party which is an appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.880" offset="20758862">And there is considerable difference because in the Retail Clerks case, although the charging party was relegated to amicus status, I'm glad that I have to refer the Court back to the appendix, to our reply brief on the -- an opposition to the petition for cert.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.758" offset="20822392">That's supplemental appendix A-43.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.664" offset="20833991">In that appendix, that appendix reflects the fact that the charging party which was only granted amicus status however presented oral argument and presented briefs and in fact, in the context of the case where the only ones to present that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.991" offset="20891355">Conversely, in our situation if we are not granted party status, we will be precluded from appealing from the denial of injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.538" offset="20921553">And if the Board's argument on control is to hold, I would submit the Board's argument control, on control is wholly without reason primarily because the Board is suggesting that it could be in the position of on the one hand having found reasonable cause what was mandatorily required to proceed with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.962" offset="20995218">On the other hand, still maintaining their reasonable cause, still going forth with the underlying case but suddenly deciding that for some reason, there might be something that in appealing the 10 (l) situation might interfere with its ultimate victory in the underlying case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5237.368" offset="21052792">I would submit that if that is the -- if that is their fear, fine!</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.137" offset="21067943">Let the chips fall where they will and then the Board perhaps will have to pull out of the underlying case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5247.230" offset="21092289">But so long as they maintain reasonable cause, so long as they don't their mind about the underlying case, I don't know whether they have a mandatory obligation to go forward but certainly, they have -- they cannot take the position that they must have control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.589" offset="21145684">They have the control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5261.947" offset="21151117">They can change their mind on reasonable cause that is the only kind of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.885" offset="21166895">And I would submit in analyzing the question of control, we must look to the kind of control the Board has urged even in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5273.594" offset="21197720">The Board -- the Board would say as the Tenth Circuit has said, the language of 10 (l) means that and no more but conversely, again looking at the scheme of the Act, the Board in charging, in charge cases, the charging party has many rights that interfere with the Board's control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.766" offset="21262399">The Board for example cannot withdraw its complaint in the Board case once having gone to hearing without giving the charging party rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.423" offset="21289044">The Board cannot settle the Board case once having gone to complaint without the charging party being heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.329" offset="21312658">I think these are the kind and I'm saying that that scheme of the Act is also transposed to the language of being heard being the fact that it's the same charging party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.845" offset="21350797">I would further argue the answer to the Norris-La Guardia argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.315" offset="21364590">Mr. Manoli gave us a number of quotes both on argument and from his brief with respect to the fears.</text>
            <text syncTime="5322.190" offset="21392175">Well, the persons who are enunciating the fears at that time, they were enunciating the fears that the passage of Taft-Hartley would return us to Norris-La Guardia and the very fear that they were concerned about was the fear that anyone be at the Board or private parties would seek injunctive relief before the merits were decided and I would submit that the Congress acted very wisely in giving the -- in entrusting the Board with their responsibility of seeking that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.816" offset="21494680">Because as we have pointed out in our reply brief on page 9, footnote 6 -- footnote 3, pardon me, the Board's record is excellent taking 1967 as a typical year and the only reason we took 1967 was because we wanted to see what happened to all those 10 (l) cases where the Board went to final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.496" offset="21573360">There was 69 cases in that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.028" offset="21583496">There were many other 10 (l) they had issued on 165 and they were almost 1500, 1800 charges under these sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.071" offset="21619649">But the significant fact is that in those cases where they went to final order where injunctive relief was either granted or denied, and the ultimate Board litigation only one case was their cause to find that the Regional Director's original cause, original basis for reasonable cause was an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.305" offset="21688613">So, I would submit that the Board is wise that the persons, the charged party has not generally been disadvantaged in terms of the Regional Director not being sustained in his finding of reasonable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.150" offset="21740022">And I would -- I submit, the finding of reasonable cause is the central issue and so long as the Regional Director maintains that reasonable cause, he cannot say that he does not have control because that is the element of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.336" offset="21792684">Simply so far as the Henderson case which counsels of both side, and I would say is not very convincing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.792" offset="21822568">The Ninth Circuit in the Retail Clerks case went to a great length to try to analyze the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5434.851" offset="21842735">The Henderson case was simply a summary discussion and really only addressed itself to the question of amicus or intervention status at the appellate level and that is inconsistent, first of all with the Retail Clerks case with respect to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.475" offset="21901249">And I would submit that there is however a more fundamental question when we are appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.987" offset="21923297">Because in order to appeal, we must be considered a party and as I have said, a party minus the right to seek, a party minus the right to urge other positions not consistent with the original position and perhaps as Moore suggest, perhaps there is some third animal in the law which could come out in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.425" offset="21993096">Something less -- something less than a full party because we can't do all those other things but yet someone having the rights of a party and someone who has -- where the rights of the amicus are not sufficient as the Court has said in Schofield.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.494" offset="22041370">Thank you.</text>
