            <label>Mr. Charles Stephen Ralston</label>
            <text syncTime="34.175" offset="240097">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.782" offset="262457">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.453" offset="277191">This case is on the writ of certiorari to review the denial by the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals the Ninth Circuit of an application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal from the denial petition for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.753" offset="354408">The Federal District Court had denied the petition on the merits without requiring either a response from the respondents here and without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.836" offset="410728">It was denied on the grounds of the petition failed to present a federal constitutional question and the certificates of probable cause were denied by both courts on the same ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.020" offset="463496">Our petitioner in this case, James Conway, was convicted in California in 1952 on two counts of a robbery in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.498" offset="521383">He -- since that time and his presently incarcerated by the State of California under the provisions of the California indeterminate sentence law and it is this law and the petitioners challenges to them that our issue in this case not only the law itself but the manner in which it has been administered by the California Adult Authority or the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.703" offset="662235">Petitioner claims on a numbered basis that the law in manner of which it is administered violates of Fourteenth Amendment guarantees against the denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.309" offset="724616">Before discussing petitioner's contentions themselves, I'd like briefly to describe the functioning of the Adult Authority and the California in determining Sentencing Law in relation to the particular facts of petitioner's case as he is alleged in this petition for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.720" offset="826284">I stated before petitioner was convicted in 1952 on two counts of a robbery in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.301" offset="860557">Following his conviction, petitioner was sentenced to state prison and in doing this the Court neither gave him a suspended sentence or gave him probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.150" offset="915937">Parenthetically, it is not evident at all from the record in this case on what basis probation or suspended sentence was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.098" offset="955747">It might have been under the provisions of Section 1203 of the California Penal Code that at that time the Superior Court Judge was prohibited from granting probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.624" offset="1013844">That section particularly as it existed in 1952 contain the a prohibition against probation in the certain kinds of cases among them arm robbery for a deadly weapon was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.879" offset="1078836">In any of that, since no probation or suspended sentence was given, the judges action is governed by California Penal Code Section 1168.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.785" offset="1134529">That Section, specifically prohibits the judge from specifying the term or duration of sentence that requires him to merely sentenced the defendant to the term prescribed by law in state prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.358" offset="1212792">For the crime of robbery in the first degree, the law prescribes a five-year minimum term but establishes no maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.090" offset="1259708">Section 671 of the Penal Code states that where there is no maximum set by the specific statute but only a minimum term of years, then punishment shall be imprisonment during natural life subject to the provisions of part three of the penal code and part three is that section which deals with the powers in the duties of the California Adult Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.151" offset="1391992">Specifically, Section 3020 of the Penal Code which states that for all persons sentenced under the provisions of Section 1168.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.732" offset="1442252">The California Adult Authority may determine and re-determine what length of time the person shall be imprison.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.579" offset="1493661">Yet, another section the Penal Code, Section 5077 delineates the two basic powers of the Adult Authority, the granting of the revocation of parole which is not involve in this case and the fixing of sentences which is the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.333" offset="1572655">Our petitioner following his sentence by the Court, following his imprisonment, made the number of appearances before the Adult Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.929" offset="1623124">Finally, in 1959 after he's been imprisoned for some seven years, approximately, the Adult Authority acted pursuant to such in 3020 and fixed petitioners terms at two-five years sentences to be served consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.204" offset="1704208">I just point out that the Superior Court Judge had specified that the sentences were to be served consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.058" offset="1743600">Again however, no term or whatsoever was that by the Superior Court Judge.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="416.116" offset="1767842">Mr. Ralston is it -- if you know is it usual for the Adult Authority to come in at a point and fix the sentence in the way it was done here, generally?</text>

            <text syncTime="432.188" offset="1832103">You mean in -- Well, under the statute, it has the duty to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.555" offset="1853628">Yes, I understand they have the power and the duty, is there any pattern that is reflected as to when that power is exercised in --</text>

            <text syncTime="449.630" offset="1901902">I do not have any specific information as to -- at what point this power is exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.340" offset="1924681">As my understanding that these terms are in facts set at some point during the persons stay in the prison particularly to deal with once the minimum term is going to be served as to exactly the pattern that I could not say.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.804" offset="2010572">Petitioner has claimed in his petition for habeas corpus that he believes the reason the Adult Authority do not act before it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.607" offset="2057801">Was it he had refused to confess dealt to the crimes of which he was punished, convicted.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="496.419" offset="2089044">Is that apparently his challenge to?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Stephen Ralston</label>
            <text syncTime="500.529" offset="2105448">No, this -- I do not believe the Attorney General has challenges his contention about the initial fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.208" offset="2132198">The Attorney General has challenged that the revocation of that fixing was based on his later refusal but the petitioners also alleged that it is -- he believes that the Adult Authority did not set his sentenced prior to 1959 because he had consistently refused every time he came up before the Adult Authority to admit that he was guilty of the crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.208" offset="2240240">It was only when he did in 1959 to say, “I'm guilty” that they then set the terms of the two to five years sentences of the minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.512" offset="2277439">As to what the general practices the Adult Authority, this record is not reflected and on myself are not sure what the specific practice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="556.865" stopTime="570.226">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="556.865" offset="2330833">Unless that -- unless we know the factual basis for that action were how can we know that we have federal question here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_stephen_ralston" startTime="570.226" stopTime="664.896">
            <label>Mr. Charles Stephen Ralston</label>
            <text syncTime="570.226" offset="2384227">Well, that's the problem in this case Mr. Justice Douglas is that there isn't -- there is an essence no record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.401" offset="2421008">All there is the petition for writ of habeas corpus and is because of the lower courts statement that there's no federal question presented at all by this challenge to the action in the Adult Authority and the dismissal on that basis it did not require response in the attorney general, no response his file, there is no evidence taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.255" offset="2528423">It was simply denied on its face as basic contention here is that at the least.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.247" offset="2560397">There should be remand to the lower court in order -- so that the facts can be develop to find out, what in fact the California Adult Authority did do in petitioners case.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.109" offset="2607835">And also the allegations of the Attorney General made for the first time in this Court concerning the practices in terms of procedures available.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.312" offset="2660603">The unfortunate thing about this case, there is no record because of the attitude of the lower courts towards challenges to the Adult Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.039" offset="2695502">They have simply in the sense said that the Adult Authority is insulated from constitutional challenge, so that state in set up this system and it can work on whatever the way it works and of these issues are not raisable in the federal habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.569" offset="2777631">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.268" offset="2780453">We feel that the state has basically misconstrued the federal habeas corpus act the requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.861" offset="2810859">It's clear from the record, the petitioner did file in the District Court in an application for a certificate of probable cause within 30 days from the denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.729" offset="2866239">That was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.533" offset="2873553">He attempted to file a notice of appeal according to the allegations of his affidavit which he filed in Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.271" offset="2904482">The District Court clerk refuse to take it, the notice of appeal presumably because there is some certificate of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.495" offset="2933321">He then attempted to go the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.619" offset="2941889">The Ninth Circuit that Judge Chambers treated the certificate of probable cause on its merits and denied it on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.102" offset="2971773">We believe that the correct approach in their correct rules was that taken by the Third Circuit in the case cited our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.278" offset="3004479">But the crucial thing is that something showing adequately and clearly showing an intension to appeal be filed within 30 days after being initial denial, particularly when you have a state prisoner acting pro improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.402" offset="3061008">Otherwise, the whole system gets encrusted with totally artificial high on time limits that are not warned by the habeas corpus act toward the federal rules or federal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.577" offset="4381654">He was asked what he planning to do in his release and he said, “he wish to return the Bakersfield to fight his case.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.110" offset="4539852">The Adult Authority revoke the two to five year terms would be effective re-sentencing petitioner to two consecutive life term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.818" offset="4582693">Our petitioner contends in this factual context, it is rights to do process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment have been violated in a number of respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.648" offset="4641938">First, he urges that the California Adult Authority hasn't giving a broad and sweeping power to sentence and re-sentence on circumstance destroyed by any standards or controls or specific procedures that is it has an arbitrary power which he claims it is in fact exercised in petitioners case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.042" offset="4751548">By revoking its prior determination in essence re-sentencing petitioner for an invalid reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.047" offset="4795538">From this argument, our petitioner urges that the lack of either standards or constitutional inadequate procedures, permits the Adult Authority to revoke and refix for invalid reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.515" offset="4849455">And essentially prohibits the petitioner from effectively influencing and bringing the bare on the determinations the Adult Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.953" offset="4895222">Those considerations which probably go into a fixing of the sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.139" offset="4931897">Petitioner in this second major argument urges after refixing in the sentence once said and began to be served violated petitioners rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause as it applies to the states by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.471" offset="5005249">Now, returning the point one petitioner, he contends of these cases govern in its essentials by this court's decision in numbered decisions and in a number of cases including Towns versus Burke, Nympha versus Ray, and North Carolina versus Pearce which is decided the last term of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.677" offset="5106082">These cases and others established beyond the question the requirements of the Due Process Clause do apply to the sentencing function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.875" offset="5154879">And what the State of California has done in this case is to transfer a substantial and significant portion of that sentencing function from the judge to an administrative agency the California Adult Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.262" offset="5216423">But its doing so, it does not therefore divest that function of these constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.772" offset="5250487">In these protections as set out in the cases that I've mentioned involve the number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.061" offset="5291656">Nympha for instance, involve the statutory scheme quite similar to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.915" offset="5319032">Where the judge is required to sentenced for the maximum terms for the actual fixing of the sentenced was done by a board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.364" offset="5364799">The court there, although, it recognized that the sentencing judges functions had been circumscribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.851" offset="5402728">Said nevertheless is basic constitutional protection, must apply to even what the judge did which was simply to gather information to pass on the board which would make its eventual determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.780" offset="5462497">It would seem to follow necessarily that these same protections wouldn't hear through the board itself when it makes the determination it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.322" offset="5512652">And among these protections, in addition to this involve directly in Nympha is that of not increasing or even originally setting a sentence for an improper reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.577" offset="5605648">And petitioner has contented and seeks to show that there was in fact an improper reason for the Adult Authorities action in his case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.102" offset="5919744">It might be noted in this case that there is no indication of the Adult Authority was it meant when it did not want petitioner to fight his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.213" offset="5968227">If the action of the Adult Authority can stand, it could very well set up and enforce a rule that a person who did not admit guilt and completely subject himself to the Adult Authority even to the extent of giving out any rights to legal process would not be let out or they term was set would be revoke and increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.116" offset="6091839">Further, petitioner contends that because the state of California has granted the kind of arbitrary power it has to the Adult Authority, that its action must be circumscribe by adequate procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.456" offset="6173236">So that the reasons and basis for its actions appear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2659.803" offset="10742575">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.745" offset="10754382">I would like to devote a few minutes to the question of the timeliness of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.516" offset="10785416">The rules of Ninth Circuit are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.887" offset="10798895">It requires as the federal statutes that there be a notice of appeal within 30 days from the file order of the District Court denying the petition for writ of habeas corpus and that pursuant to the statute requiring a certificate of probable cause that such a certificate be obtained either within 30 days after denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus or 30 days after a denial of the certificate of probable cause by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.126" offset="10935881">These are four more liberal rules and that followed in after circuits such as the first and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.549" offset="10965556">The Court itself have the chief judge granted the certificate under the cases we've cited, the panel would have examined this question either on our motion or on its own motion and would have dismissed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.002" offset="11031385">The rules are very liberal there, any paper that notes so intent to appeal will be deem as a notice of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.166" offset="11072031">And what happen here was that the district judge denied the petition on September 27th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.284" offset="11096482">On October 10th, the petitioner filed eight application for a certificate of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.116" offset="11127829">He denied -- the district judge denied that application on October 31st.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.473" offset="11149249">However, under the rules of the Ninth Circuit, that application for certificate of probable cause maybe deemed a timely notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.570" offset="11189687">But of course, that does perfect the appeal, there must be a certificate of probable cause granted timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.993" offset="11219362">The application in subsequent denial by the District Court added to his time, 30 days from October 31st to apply for a certificate of probable cause in the Court of Appeals or as indicated by the earlier question the circuit with the judge designed of the circuit of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.426" offset="11329076">However, nothing was done to the record reflects until December 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.572" offset="11353631">When the Clerk received the document labeled an affidavit in which two allegations are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.816" offset="11382680">One, that the petitioner had sought the file a notice of appeal in the District Court on November 17th and had tendered the $5.00 fee which was taken from the trust account of the fellow inmate and the Clerk had refused the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.542" offset="11449553">Well, this is irrelevant because there is a good notice of appeal under the rules already filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.095" offset="11479751">He also asserts that he attempted the file in the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.714" offset="11498245">A writ of mandate, for a petition for writ of mandate, requiring the warden to permitting to withdraw $5.00 from the trust account of the same fellow inmate for the purpose of his filing fee which is of course inconsistent with his earlier statement that he tendered $5.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.615" offset="11585808">Then, he ask generally for an extension of time but this is some 44 days after the denial of the certificate of probable cause in the District Court and some 74 days after or longer after the denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus is out time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.450" offset="11677132">The judge did deem this document to be an application for a certificate of probable cause and denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.746" offset="11710360">But we say and reviewed the panel would have under the rules of that Court have filed it untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.099" offset="11739721">Such a rule and certainly not unreasonable, certainly done in constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.791" offset="11762500">There must time limitations of policy of other of the statute requiring 30 days for a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.472" offset="11797295">Certainly contemplates that the time for appeal that notice be given timely and that clerk, the court, the parties, now that the appeal is pending and that the option for protecting the appeal are not be left with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.854" offset="11866781">Secondly if facilitates the policy of Congress requiring in limiting the appeals in this kinds of cases by the virtue of a fact that in large major they place burden upon the Federal Courts and upon the states because as a plus they are generally in their authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.629" offset="11981928">Furthermore, this man is not cut off on any right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.757" offset="12002408">The denial of their petition for an application of petition for habeas corpus is not filed, it always go back in front.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.143" offset="12031979">File, he's not anything as you like news are right to pursue a point in an appeal from the criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.562" offset="12077641">Finally, we have argued that the -- there was no abuse of discretion here by the Circuit Court in the denial of the appli -- denial of the application for a certificate of probable cause based on the long standing precedents both of this Court and of the circuit courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.768" offset="12162487">We say that there was no substantial federal question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.746" offset="12182340">Our next contention is that on the facts of this case, the petitioner has in fact received what he claims he must received by the Adult Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.418" offset="12237093">His term has been refixed for a cause and I might clarify the point raised earlier that this is not final, under state law there is in determined of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.309" offset="12288606">In this case filed the life consecutive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.323" offset="12300622">Its fixed by statute at maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.497" offset="12309400">The Adult Authority fixed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.760" offset="12318386">The term and the minimum in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.804" offset="12330611">They then refixed it as they do in case of any violations at the maximum but that is not final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.376" offset="12364884">They normally, usually, in virtually every case refixed it again at less than maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.634" offset="12405948">Now, in this case the petitioner, the record reflects that there was cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.113" offset="12439803">He was in fact and that he'd receive notice and a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.363" offset="12460805">He was engage in a -- his term was fixed in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.269" offset="12484420">He appeared before the board in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.773" offset="12494451">December of 1960 engaged in the fight, fellow inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.943" offset="12511169">He was given notice and a complaint which set out those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.903" offset="12526947">He was notified there would be a hearing before the disciplinary board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.219" offset="12540217">The hearing was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.295" offset="12544502">He appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.942" offset="12547114">He gave version of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.984" offset="12559339">He was found that he participated in this fight as report pursuing to the rules of the Adult Authority were forwarded to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.018" offset="12587447">It adopted the findings of the prison disciplinary group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.331" offset="12616704">It sets his hearing over for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.772" offset="12634467">At that hearing, the record reflects that by his own allegations that he discussed turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.805" offset="12670621">He had a hearing in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.428" offset="12681070">He had noticed and the notice original note is filed in the December indicated that one of the results of this hearing could be refixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.674" offset="12718059">So, he has notified in the writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.686" offset="12730075">He knew in fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.911" offset="13023065">It simply an indication that he is not adjusted or rehabilitated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.761" offset="13038425">There's not presented a sufficient risk to be placed on the parole and to have the term fixed and go into the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.357" offset="13080848">That is all that indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.938" offset="13095163">Our final argument is that, there is Constitution does not require in this situation, anymore than there be cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.521" offset="13141452">Due process and I simply requires the Sixth Amendment is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.273" offset="13168515">These are not criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.219" offset="13176247">There is then an argument here that this is the keen to sentencing and that indeed the judges is very limited which is not so in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.503" offset="13233403">As we indicated in our brief, only 17% of those people convicted of felonies are ever sent to the State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.527" offset="13269452">The other 83% are given probation, jail, conditions of probation, sent to other institutions such as the Narcotic Treatment Center or mental ins -- other mental institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.619" offset="13333817">The fact is that at that point, the punitive part of the criminal process has ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.827" offset="13370702">The punitive part of the prison term is that which is the minimum set for the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.141" offset="13407901">But he sentence him to the state prison, the minimum represent the legislature determination that fact will suffice -- that that will suffice to deter a third persons from committing these kinds of acts here arm robbery and that will serve to punish the individual involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.001" offset="13487417">But as Judge Goodrich has said, once the period of contentious litigations is over, when a man accused of crime its tried in the sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.741" offset="13538304">Now, the problem becomes one of an attempt that rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.430" offset="13557112">There is no place for the punitive process once that minimum term in state prison is fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.011" offset="13607372">As our contention that Minford versus Ray does not apply here as your other point out that involve counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.927" offset="13651048">That on the revocation of parole, the sentence had not been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.179" offset="13668080">The counsel was neither to marshal the facts one and you stated that even more important was the necessity of counsel to preserve rights which otherwise would have been lost to with an appeal and specifically, an appeal and a right to withdraw of that plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.597" offset="13737775">No rights are lost in this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.890" offset="13746970">It can always be fixed and refixed, there is nothing final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.711" offset="13766196">Secondly, the case of Minford versus Ray did not overrule the case of Williams versus New York, in which this Court stated it at that point at sentencing a man was not entitled to all of the procedural protections that were recorded to the man during the criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.320" offset="13856684">Specifically, that he did not have the right of confrontation in cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.147" offset="13879986">That the judge could rely upon probation reports, hearsay as to the man background, he's social adjustment, his education, his training, his jobs, his family, all of those factors that go into the determination of sentence along with the punitive element in the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.610" offset="13973817">This Court has said in cases and indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.981" offset="13987297">Mr. Justice Black said, “they have the Due Process Clause should not be treated as the device for freezing the evidential procedure of sentencing in the mold of trial procedure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.619" offset="14033899">As our contention here that the kind of procedure and the very nature of the thing involve as indicated in numerous cases of such as Hannah versus Larthe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.269" offset="14080397">The nature of the proceeding must be look to in determining what due process rights are applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.195" offset="14108191">The nature of the proceeding and the burden placed upon that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.597" offset="14125746">The courts have indicated that they use a lot of terms that this is a privilege, it's a never of grace, its not an adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.160" offset="14163989">But I think that the Court miss the circuit properly pointed out that his characterization does not answer the question that we must look to the nature of what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.228" offset="14224280">Not simply characterized as a privilege or approach of right and the nature of what we are dealing with here is the determination by a group of experts who are concerned with the rehabilitation and the readjustment of people committed to the state prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.885" offset="14330964">At the other hand, they must look at the risk they present to the public and there is one point I would like to make and that is that the in making these evaluations, the wider the latitude they have in making it, the greater possibility before error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.154" offset="14411943">That is that there are greater possibility that they made a mistake, that the man maybe a bad risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.248" offset="14440364">And on the other hand, the more difficult is it is for such groups to correct that error, then the less latitude they will have in making that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.954" offset="14503163">Either as a matter of fact or as a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.503" offset="14521344">I say, we do the prisoners know service when we impose upon this procedure, any burden be on that that requires that agency to act with cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.212" offset="14596263">I suggest that the board must and does look at his entire background in the fixing and refixing of these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.564" offset="14657599">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3644.047" offset="14679542">I -- thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.712" offset="14686229">I would like to make two very quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.195" offset="14696155">Number one, the issue has been raised concerning whether there is an exhaustion of state remedies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.876" offset="14730846">The lower court did not dismiss this petition on the basis of exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.571" offset="14757700">Number two, there are allegation in the second habeas petition on page 11 as to what was raised in the Supreme Court of California and his allegations are brief warden says in the Adult Authority took advantage of its loose definition to coerce petitioner making weaken submissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.669" offset="14842023">What else may have been in this habeas petition is not set out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.300" offset="14860622">It is part of the record, it was part of the record in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.440" offset="14877132">Again, this issue of exhaustion whether these issues are properly raised before the State Courts is a matter that could be best be resolved by the District Court on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.242" offset="14912345">This is again the problem in this case for the dismissal without asking for response, without having a hearing, without exploring the record to find out what in fact has happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.022" offset="14959470">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3714.421" offset="14961037">Would it not be more accurate or perhaps accurate to say that the state -- that the federal court in the first go around had no occasion to or even reach the matter of exhaustion of state remedies?</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.931" offset="15019133">By the way that the case was treated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3734.077" offset="15039718">So, with that disposition, they wouldn't even consider.</text>
