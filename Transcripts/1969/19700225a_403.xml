            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="53.186" offset="316165">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.477" offset="329331">This is a criminal case here on certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.203" offset="376142">It involves an interesting and novel question under the Fourth Amendment with respect to search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.434" offset="445106">The facts, the underlying facts in this case occurred on March 28 and 29, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.431" offset="493066">On that day, not quite two years ago, at 1:30 pm at the United States Post Office at Mt. Vernon in the State of Washington, the respondent appeared, deposited for mailing two heavy packages, 12 pounds each.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.067" offset="603617">It is relevant that the post office at Mt. Vernon, Washington is in the western part of the State of Washington and about 60 miles south of the Canadian border.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.194" offset="656175">One of these packages was addressed to a post office box in Van Nuys, California and the other two to a post office box in Nashville, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.869" offset="714898">Both bore a return address in a neighboring town adjacent to Mt. Vernon.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.503" offset="757426">Postage was paid at the airmail rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.380" offset="776861">The packages were registered and insured, each one for $10,000.00, a total of $20,000.00 for the two, and in response to a request from the post office clerk, it was declared that they contained coins or a coin collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.267" offset="876440">The post office clerk was suspicious and he immediately advised an officer of the Mt. Vernon police who happened to be in the lobby of his suspicions, and Captain Belgard of the police observed the car departing and noticed that it had British Columbia license plates.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.839" offset="978735">The package was then examined and the police captain and the post office clerk were both aware of the fact that the address given on the package was of a nearby -- a junior college of quarters which had been unoccupied for several weeks.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="240.642" offset="1065984">That was the address here, the return address?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="242.833" stopTime="1009.445">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="242.833" offset="1074657">The return address, the return address.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.436" offset="1097122">Captain Belgard then perhaps somewhat surprisingly telephoned the Canadian Royal Mounted Police and not the U.S. customs or the FBI, but he telephoned the Canadian Police in Vancouver and it was the Canadian Police who put in a call to Mr. O’Hearn, the Customs Officer-in-charge at Seattle, Washington, and the details so far as they were known were thus transmitted to Mr. O’Hearn in Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.935" offset="1247065">By this time, it was about 3 o'clock in the afternoon and Mr. O'Hearn then put in a telephone call to the Customs Office in Van Nuys in California, and he was advised that the addressee of the package being sent there was under investigation for dealing in illegal coins.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.186" offset="1344136">By the time he had completed that call, it was beyond the closing time in Nashville, which I believe is three hours in advance of Seattle; it may be two, and Mr. O'Hearn then delayed until the following morning in calling to Nashville, the morning of the 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.551" offset="1441625">He got similar information from the Customs Officer in Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.999" offset="1463359">I believe he had to do that through Mobile as a matter of fact since the headquarters was in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.433" offset="1505155">Mr. O'Hearn then prepared the affidavit for a search warrant, which appears on page 5 of this record and of course, the preparation of that took time both for composition and for typing.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.511" offset="1573386">It was then presented to the United States Commissioner in Seattle, and that of course took time to find the Commissioner free from other responsibilities and to give him time for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.288" offset="1652485">At 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the following day, March 29, the Commissioner issued a search warrant in Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.460" offset="1693236">Now, Seattle is some 60 miles south of Mt. Vernon and Mr. O'Hearn took the search warrant to Mt. Vernon and there served it at 6:30 pm on March 29, which is about 29 hours after the events first began when the package was deposited in the post office in Mt. Vernon.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.997" offset="1815385">And the problem arises because the package was held in Mt. Vernon and was not forwarded at once through the usual United States Post Office channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.329" offset="1872645">When the warrant was served, the packages were found to contain several hundred gold coins.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.949" offset="1911202">The packages were resealed, sent on to the addressees, they were refused by the addressees and were returned to the post office in Mt. Vernon.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.540" offset="1981524">Now, other evidence at the trial showed that the respondent had in fact imported these coins.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.530" offset="2017468">There was a motion to suppress the evidence of the gold coins, which was denied by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.716" offset="2054248">The respondent was convicted of a violation of the Customs Laws in having imported the coins without a proper declaration, and an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.177" offset="2124048">That Court held that the evidence should have been suppressed on the ground that the delay in holding the coins in Mt. Vernon for 29 hours was unreasonable and a violation of the Fourth Amendment and that is the sole issue which is now before the Court on the government's petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.886" offset="2258944">Before going further, let me simply recall the simple words of the Fourth Amendment, “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.075" offset="2403662">And here of course, a warrant was issued, on probable cause supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.866" offset="2470849">This is not a case of search without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.183" offset="2488090">Here, there was a search with a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.051" offset="2503555">The problem arises because the police officers were careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.088" offset="2523721">They took the time to be sure that they had the proper facts and because the post office employee cooperated in that process by holding the package at Mt. Vernon, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.167" offset="2596028">Now, it could of course be said that once the package was in the custody of the post office, it should have been sent on and somehow or other, the officers could have followed it and kept track of it and before it was actually delivered at their respective destinations, these various inquiries could have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.878" offset="2698846">The logistic and manpower problems involved and that the number of people required in at least three or four different locations as such as it seems to me to make that approach not a reasonable requirement under all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.845" offset="2794768">Now, there is an aspect of this case which seems to me to be of very considerable importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.196" offset="2836146">Last June, this Court decided the Shamel case, and curiously enough also involving coins.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.428" offset="2869060">I don't know whether coins have become a special target in this area and in the Shamel case, some of the prior decisions of the Court with respect to the extent to which a search without a warrant may be made incident to an arrest were sharply cut down.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.564" offset="2981595">And there is a consequence of the Shamel case, which I assume is going to have to be presented in later cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.119" offset="3019839">That is the extent to which granting that the police cannot conduct an extensive search and seizure in the premises incident to an arrest, to what extent can the police officers impose a stillstand on the situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="749.812" offset="3102595">Lock the door, keep people from entering and leaving, prevent people inside the premises from destroying evidences while they go through the necessary process obviously requiring under current conditions of several hours of preparing a warrant -- an affidavit for a search warrant under -- in many cases, this will require not merely the police officer but participation by a lawyer and assistant United States attorney or appropriate state officer, typing, finding a magistrate, submitting it to him, and giving him an opportunity to consider it, and then upon it's issuance, the opportunity to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.592" offset="3301752">And unless there is some opportunity to impose a stillstand, not to seize but simply to hold things in the status -- status quo, the evidence in many of these cases will be destroyed and the opportunity to make an effective search will evaporate.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.040" offset="3407496">Now, that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.181" offset="3420139">This has nothing to do with a search incident to an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.705" offset="3446157">This is a situation, however, where post office employees in association with other governmental officers, did preserve the situation in status quo by not sending on the package in the normal processes of the U.S. mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.469" offset="3533197">I would point out too in the consideration of this matter as bearing on the reasonableness of their action that there is no communication involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.832" offset="3574680">There is no letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.191" offset="3584188">There is no transmission of intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.041" offset="3599548">This was simply goods, simply gold coins.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.903" offset="3622954">The delay of 29 hours in the delivery of a package is not unprecedented and there is nothing to indicate that it was a matter of any seriousness to anyone involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.625" offset="3693902">Now, it's curious, though I suppose explainable because of the development of -- the recent development of cases like Shamel, but it's curious that it's almost impossible to find any indication in the decisions in this Court or elsewhere of the extent to which the police may take steps to preserve the status quo while warrants are being obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.650" offset="3829948">Back, a generation ago in Taylor against the United States, this Court pointed out that “a short period of watching during the time required to secure a search warrant could have prevented the possibility of any change in the premises from which government agents had smelled the order of whiskey.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.614" offset="3937782">” And in the Trupiano case in 334 U.S., the Court striking down a search without a warrant noted that a warrant could have been obtained without any risk of removal since one of the agents, and I quote, “was on hand at all times to report and guard against such a move.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.425" offset="4045093">” Now, there were no issue in those cases as to the validity of a restraint which might have been imposed while a warrant was being obtained, but the Court in those cases seemed to feel that such a restraint would have been not only natural and understandable, but justifiable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.445" offset="4141119">You could have -- you could have gotten a warrant and seized the package on the other end of the shipment, I suppose, couldn't you?</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.927" offset="4183124">I mentioned that in stating the facts, but the problems of tracing and keeping track of, and a number of people involved and frankly, I don't know whether a warrant issued by United States Commissioner in Seattle is valid in Van Nuys, California or in Nashville, Tennessee, whether it might not have had to be presented to a commissioner in those places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.037" offset="4307571">One of the charges against this warrant now pressed, I believe is that it was based on hearsay and on facts not within the knowledge of the affiant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.325" offset="4356681">It would of course be of far more extreme as you got two officers in California and in Nashville, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.346" offset="4396805">It would have involved a great many -- more people, and our position is that the limited delay in this case, not six months, not a week, 29 hours, or not much more than overnight was not unreasonable under the circumstances, particularly when it was the consequence of the fact that the officers were trying to do their duty carefully and thoughtfully, were seeking to obtain a search warrant, were trying to discover the facts so that if there was no basis for a warrant, that would not be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.259" offset="4596381">And our view is that to impose a requirement that you must send the things on and then try to catch them before they're delivered would be too technical, required too much expenditure of manpower, too much risk of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.003" offset="4699408">When the suspected material is in the custody of the United States and rightly so, this reasonable -- this period seems to us to have been a reasonable one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1301.711" offset="5310255">Well, that raises all kinds of questions about self incrimination that I -– that I don't think we need to go into here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.833" offset="5354663">In some ways, the case which seems to me to be the closest is the Terry case, it's Terry against Ohio decided two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.519" offset="5413491">I think I would like, before referring to Terry case however, to make reference to Mr. Justice White's dissenting opinion in the Shamel Case because he did, there deal more extensively than I've been able to find any place else with what I regard as the underlying problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.051" offset="5511607">Now, it is true that he was using it as an argument that the search without a warrant should be valid and he was in the minority on that, and we are not contending here that a search without a warrant is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.002" offset="5575346">But on page 774 of Justice White's dissent, he said, “When there must almost always be a strong possibility that confederates of the arrested man will in the meanwhile remove the items for which the police have probable cause to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.062" offset="5647653">And on page 775, he says, “Moreover, had the police simply arrested the petitioner, taken him off to the station house and later returned with a warrant, it seems very likely that the petitioner's wife, who in view of petitioner's generally garrulous nature must have known of the robbery, would have removed the coins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.948" offset="5739186">Now, our position is that, our contention, our suggestion is that that argument not having prevailed, there nevertheless remains open this question which I call of the opportunity to impose the stillstand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.117" offset="5815881">Now, just how that can be done, what manpower's involved, what force can properly be used remains to be seen?</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.037" offset="5855483">But we contend here that in a different situation where the goods are already in the custody of the United States, having been confined to the -- confided to the United States Mail that it is appropriate for the officers of the government to preserve the status quo while the warrant is being carefully and thoughtfully obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.922" offset="5987035">Now, I would like to refer to the Terry case itself because that is a case which goes into these questions of unreasonable search and seizure, the meaning of unreasonable where you do not have an arrest or a seizure involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.904" offset="6115035">In the Terry case, you remember the problem was of the power of the police to take action short of an arrest by way of what is popularly known as stop and frisk, by way of patting a man's clothes to see whether he was armed and on finding a hard object, reaching in and removing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.432" offset="6261112">And in that opinion, Chief Justice Warren discussed at some length the difference between the cause required to obtain a search warrant, which would be probable cause to -- or an arrest warrant, it would be in that case -– a probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed and the cause which was required for a police officer to take this interlocutory step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.147" offset="6435924">And it really comes down to this, whether there was probable cause for suspicion with respect to the commission of a crime and the safety of the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.373" offset="6504887">I won't take the time to quote from that opinion, particularly on pages 21 to 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.784" offset="6534457">Only by way of analogy, but by considerable analogy, there is discussion of this shorter step of this step short of an arrest or of a procedure and we feel that there is a substantial support in the Terry case for the proposition that the step taken here, and the only step against which complaint is made is the holding of the package for 29 hours and it would've had to be held for a substantial portion of that at the very best, but that was not unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.240" offset="7316355">First of all, let me point out with tongue and cheek as did Judge Chambers of the Court of Appeals that I, too, am not too much dismayed by delay of my mail because oftentimes, it is delayed for longer than 29 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.694" offset="7394200">But he held in concurring opinion that this was done without judicial authority here and that the delay was intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.155" offset="7439966">Now, I submit there is a distinction between the intentional delay of one's mail protected by the Fourth Amendment and the delay of one's mail which is unintentional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3284.926" offset="13243120">Now, they could've gotten a warrant and searched the packages at the other end.</text>

            <text syncTime="3430.750" offset="13826382">But now, we have one further argument, and that is where the goods are already in the custody of the United States, is it okay to preserve the status quo while the warrant is being obtained, and I would ask you why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.881" offset="13866924">Why is such an argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.964" offset="13883225">These packages are placed with the United States Post Office in a form of trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="3605.306" offset="14524583">I have no qualms about his having been in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.331" offset="14532733">I know he was guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.736" offset="14534301">He's admitted it, but I submit that the law now must be kept straightened out as the Court of Appeals has so found.</text>

            <text syncTime="3622.927" offset="14595114">I have just two points that I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.668" offset="14614026">Mr. Davis has referred to statutes which required the mail, as he has said to be forwarded promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.484" offset="14653315">Actually, the statute is printed at the bottom of page 2 of the appendix to his brief, Section 710 of Title 39 of the United States Code and it reads, “Letters brought for mailing to a post office and so forth shall be sent on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.486" offset="14729279">This of course was not a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.158" offset="14740041">I don't regard this as of any great importance, but I do not think there was any violation of that statute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.301" offset="14772537">And the other point I would make is –-</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="3668.816" offset="14778598">He then have penalty of failure to do that?</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="3673.719" offset="14798242">Is there a penalty of a failure to do that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="3675.681" offset="14806079">No, this is an internal housekeeping part of the post office statute, a direction to postal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.089" offset="14843695">There are other statutory provisions which make it a crime with penalties attached to interfere with the mails, but I understand them to be directed to outsiders, to persons who obstruct the mails in one way or another and not to postal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.598" offset="14921749">Now, the other point that I would like to make is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.472" offset="14937213">It would seem that Mr. Davis' real complaint is that the warrant was not obtained on March 28, rather on March 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.043" offset="14983502">I think it could be that warrant could have been obtained on March 28 and that I don't think I would have too much difficulty in seeking to defend it here, if it had been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.992" offset="15031359">I would point out that the information then available related to only one of the packages, which might have been enough to establish a crime, but not enough to seize the other package.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.426" offset="15081096">What I would hope would be that the Court would leave a little leeway here, not to setup a rule which would mean that the instant you really now have enough, you must then and there go in and get it because the lines are not easy to draw here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.833" offset="15146715">They are hard to draw long after the event and the calm deliberation of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.402" offset="15168972">They are much harder to draw for the individual officer on the scene who has to decide whether “well, if I go in now, will it be found that I did not have enough?</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.320" offset="15216619">Here, the officer was careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.666" offset="15226023">He did no harm in the process of being careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.856" offset="15238771">It seems to me he ought to be commended for having done a fine work and that the delay which was involved was reasonable and should not be held to invalidate the seizure in this case.</text>
