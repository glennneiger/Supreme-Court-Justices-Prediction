            <text syncTime="58.302" offset="336541">This case involves the question of what procedural rights are to be afforded to the most dependent members of our society: the aged, the disabled, the blind, and the children of the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.589" offset="401742">The basic issue presented by this case is whether welfare recipients, after being found eligible, after full and vigorous investigation, are to have their benefits terminated without an opportunity for a full and fair adjudicative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.664" offset="490036">In California, at the present time, there is a hearing which comports with the requirements of due process after the termination of welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.238" offset="540296">Under the regulations adopted by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, this hearing takes place-- should take place within 60 days from the date of termination of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.072" offset="587630">In point of fact, the hearing takes place long after that 60-day period, as has been conceded by appellees of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.077" offset="771636">Prior to termination of benefits, a welfare recipient is not afforded an adjudicative hearing to contest the reasons upon which the department has based its decision to terminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.895" offset="830986">A welfare recipient is only provided with an opportunity to confer informally, usually with the very individual who has made the initial decision to terminate at a conference which can take place at a minimum of three days before a check will be terminated or a check will be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.457" offset="925236">There is no opportunity within this short period of time to adequately prepare for this conference, nor is there an opportunity at the conference to have an opportunity to fairly and fully adjudicate the questions which might involve continuing eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.782" offset="998484">Questions, for example, such as whether an individual has intended to transfer property to remain on public assistance, questions which are traditionally been decided in adjudicative hearings with the procedural protections usually connected with such hearings.</text>

Getting to the fair hearing and the link of time that it takes for the fair hearing, in appellant’s reply brief, there is set forth a table that I found shocking of the case’s fair hearings that have been pending from one to two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.375" offset="9868831">I immediately called the Chief Referee of the department and he, with very little time, went through the ones that were over year old, and he found that in most of them, if not all of them, should have been closed out due to being unable to find the claimant, that the matter had been settled at the department level, that the claimant had asked for an indefinite continuance, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.167" offset="10064018">But, most of these-- but due to the terrific increase in fair hearing requests from 500 normal requests a month to 700 now, in July, August, and September, that they felt that they should try to meet the 60-day requirement, try to meet the state regulation that the hearing must be held within 17 days of the request for the hearing, and not bother because they haven’t had a commiserate increase in clerical staff or referees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.041" offset="10235486">Consequently, they have also adopted the position that when the referee hears it, and that the claimant is right, that’s going to be the referee’s decision, that decision goes out immediately, less harm to the recipient whose hearing decision is going to be unfavorable to the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.430" offset="10333080">Now, that isn’t ideal, but at least it’s the best thing that the department feels that they can do under the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.701" offset="10470170">Last fiscal year, there was 6,218.</text>

            <text syncTime="3129.118" offset="12619839">No, there’s nothing in the record about it, and I was interested in counsel stating that the only time they want the full fair hearing prior to termination is when there are “factual conflicts,” I believe was the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.375" offset="12704893">That isn’t the prior that was asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.193" offset="12716178">The prior asked for the full fair hearing whenever a county is contemplating suspending, terminating of ai-- or withholding of aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.588" offset="12761736">This was the position that counsel took at the public hearing on the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.901" offset="12794964">This was our understanding of counsel’s position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.964" offset="12811264">I am surprised that that, apparently, is not their position before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.924" offset="12843029">In California, one can file for a fair hearing within any-- within one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.861" offset="12878764">However, Under the Macola order, and you have heard about the Macola order which was a somewhat unusual order, which ordered when the preorder hearing conference to be held, just as I’ve outlined to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.081" offset="12947728">That if the Court-- if the department was satisfied that aid should be terminated, there was-- the recipient was so advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.726" offset="12982314">Then if the recipient requested a fair hearing accompanied by an affidavit which specifically negated the reasons given by the county for ineligibility, then aid must be resumed pending the fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.132" offset="13071862">In the briefs, it’s pointed out that this has not been used very much that-- or not that it has not been used, but it hasn’t crossed state very much, and I contend it’s because it hasn’t been used very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.693" offset="13114180">There were only three restorations of aid from Los Angeles County where there are over half-a-million welfare cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.620" offset="13137899">So, whether this is being one of the most, well-kept secrets, I don’t know, but at least it has not been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.006" offset="13167365">It’s a cumbersome procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.017" offset="13175411">It’s one that takes quite a bit of county time but, regardless of that, it’s-- it hasn’t created much of a stir.</text>
