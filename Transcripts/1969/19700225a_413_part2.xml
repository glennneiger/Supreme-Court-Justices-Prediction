            <text syncTime="17.254" offset="172387">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.720" offset="202271">The petitioners in this case contend that the evidence is constitutionally insufficient to support the judgment and as a basis for that contention, they refer to three of the 45 exhibits which were introduced by the respondent which the trial court instructed the jury it was to consider and which it did in fact consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.212" offset="340198">Now, some of those exhibits are contained in the printed record, others which are not as important as the major exhibits are in the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.145" offset="391920">But the Court of Appeals specifically made mention of the fact that in addition to the publications that Mr. Bresler had committed blackmail, there were publications that he had engaged in an unethical trade, had been guilty of skullduggery, had had legal proceedings started against him for failure to make construction, corrections in accordance with county standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.608" offset="489827">These allegations were injurious to Mr. Bresler and his business as a contractor and were libelous per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.372" offset="520861">The Court had also previously referred in its opinion to another article which was published prior to the three foregoing articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.670" offset="566000">On April 22, 1965, before the blackmail articles and before Mr. Bresler became a candidate for comptroller and that was headlined, City Battles Bresler on Two Fronts.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.092" offset="619708">There was a sub caption court suit, it was written by petitioner Skolnick and it falsely alleged that the city and Bresler will also be at odds this week when the suit filed by the city against Ivy Homes, Inc. and Boxwood Village Inc. comes before the Circuit Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.957" offset="759202">The evidence is all the way through it with some of these other matters because as I read the opinion, the essence of it was the blackmail charge?</text>

            <label>Mr. Abraham Chasanow</label>
            <text syncTime="172.778" offset="794520">We do not dispute the fact that this was the principle charge but I'd like to point out that in the second blackmail article for example, there was the word skullduggery and when the -- Mr. Skolnick was asked on the stand about the word skullduggery, he said, this is the word that the reporter used in the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.456" offset="873200">When the reporter testified for the petitioners, she said, I did not use that word, that was inserted and as frequently happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.453" offset="929207">Now this was a change and this was what the Court of Appeals also said was intended to impute dishonesty on the part of Bresler.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.823" offset="994617">The trial court specifically said of course that the jury should consider all of the articles in evidence and also instructed the jury that it was to consider the entire context.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.854" offset="1062745">Now, I emphasize that because one of their principle arguments says that the word blackmail was taken out of context and it didn't mean what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.524" offset="1109452">Well, first, they had taken it out of context but publishing it as a caption in the first article.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.890" offset="1138918">Secondly, the reporters both said that they had not published all of their notes concerning the meeting but that they had used the word blackmail.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.793" offset="1174549">The second reporter, the reporter who wrote the second article said, I selected out the word blackmail to show it was Mr. Herling's word.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.063" offset="1215613">But she said, I didn't use all my notes and when I asked her why she selected out the word, she said, well, it had been used, the word the week before and I felt it was proper to use it again in the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.732" offset="1262320">The Court of Appeals makes one other important point and that is that these people --</text>

            <text syncTime="668.299" offset="2776586">Mr. Bresler was the foreigner, he was the outsider.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.925" offset="2791111">He was coming into Greenbelt.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.530" offset="2801455">Now, in order to put this case in proper perspective, I'd like to mention one thing that the Court of Appeals noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.571" offset="2825697">The respondent -- the petitioner Skolnick was a member of this organization identified as GHI Greenbelt Homes which had once owned the land in controversy plus some 300 acres more.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.343" offset="2884733">The federal government had sold that land together with the house in Greenbelt to this corporation and said, “We want you to control the development around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.939" offset="2919111">So we're selling you this land at a low price.”</text>
            <text syncTime="706.732" offset="2930291">Instead of developing it, they took a quick profit, they sold it.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.013" offset="2951398">Then they realized that they might have made a mistake that somebody else was making the profits that they might have made and then stepping in the first blackmail article, one of the councilmen said, and he was a member of GHI, how much profit is he going to make?</text>
            <text syncTime="725.650" offset="3005942">This was a burning question.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.380" offset="3012942">The other was that Mr. Bresler and his associate had plans which were interfering with their own plans, for example on this matter of the townhouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.325" offset="3056724">Parcels one and two were adjacent to Greenbelt homes property.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.031" offset="3071457">They were fighting, the townhouses on that -- those parcels because the fact, they were going to build their own townhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.323" offset="3104684">As a matter of fact, they've built there as in Bresler hasn't built a single townhouse on parcel one and two.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.873" offset="3126836">Then also, they were going to tell the school board where to put the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.936" offset="3147107">Now, the school board planned a high school and two other schools and they said, we don't want the high school next door.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.738" offset="3178350">We want you to build a high school on parcel 15 which was remote and much more expensive which was next to the beltway which was undesirable for a number of reasons and even filed suit against the school board to prevent them from building the school on parcels one and two.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.554" offset="3249612">They were also saying to the Park and Planning Commission which was the official professional planning organization for the entire county, we don't want you to zone this property for townhouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.934" offset="3311156">Now, they were trying to dictate even though they had once owned and controlled this property, they were trying to dictate how this property was going to be developed and this is a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.355" offset="3352743">These were amateur planners who were trying to tell the professionals what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.400" offset="3373014">I think that in order to recognize the posture of this case, let me jump to the articles which start with the announcement that Mr. Bresler was going to run for comptroller.</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.135" offset="4919881">That's what made him a public figure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1211.891" offset="4950915">No sir, I think I could point out more clearly what made him a public figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.389" offset="4968887">In 1964 on May 7 when there was some dispute, some discussion of the council, the News Review published a report that the council and the audience decided it made much more sense to it, stop attacking each other and concentrate on a common target, Bresler who wasn't there and that was when they decided that they had to have a scapegoat because Bresler only owned a minority interest in these properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.620" offset="5093857">He was not the major owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.302" offset="5104619">There were others who owned more of an interest than he, but they had to have a name and his was a name that was selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.884" offset="5134921">They were -- this was followed up by the group sponsored by Greenbelt Homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.830" offset="5170657">Mr. Schwan who was president, in which they announced on April, 8, 1965 that the saved Greenbelt Group gets its officers a name CFPG and they formed this organization with Mr. Schwan with Mayor Smith with Albert Herling who made one of the blackmail accusations with Mrs. Skolnick and then on April, 22, they announced not only a citizenship assistant wide -- a citywide membership drive but had an article, City Battles Bresler on Two Fronts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.789" offset="5314539">He was singled out by the News Review and that was when they made the false allegation with the subtitle court suit that the city and Bresler will be at odds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.561" offset="5353618">Now, Bresler was not a defendant in that case and they knew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.556" offset="5369605">Even later, on May, 6, after there had been a hearing and after the Court had issued an order against Ivy Homes, Inc. in which Bresler had no interest whatsoever, this was what the News Review said, “At a hearing held two weeks ago, a court order was issued to the builders of Boxwood, another Bresler development.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.110" offset="5459780">Bresler had nothing to do with that development to which the court urged, but they wanted to feature his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.914" offset="5482977">The exhibit showed that they constantly featured his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.887" offset="5494888">This is like the man who pleaded for leniency on the ground that he was an orphan after he had shot his parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.076" offset="5527698">They had made him a public figure and they were using this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.371" offset="5544835">They were using the public official defense even though they knew that there was no relation and there was no mention in the articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.642" offset="5577958">But getting through the time when they announced Charles Bresler to run for state comptroller on June, 9, 1966, and this is where we get into the question of malice.</text>
