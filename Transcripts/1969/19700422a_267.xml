            <text syncTime="58.472" offset="337272">I am Robert Anthony Jacques, attorney for petitioner Number 267.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.629" offset="357857">I believe a brief statement of the chronology of events would be in order before we start the issues presented to me by the Court in this case under the instructions of last June 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.526" offset="409475">The petitioner in this case, Dennis Mullene Moon was arrested on June 2, 1964 and was tried on December 17, 1964, convicted on January 7, 1965 for the crime of armed robbery in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.513" offset="497455">On October 23, 1965, the Court of Appeals of Maryland decided Schowgurow versus State of Maryland and as a result of that decision, they held it limitedly retroactive to include petitioner in these proceedings and invited or said that he could avail himself of that decision and take a new trial if he so desire since his conviction had not yet been made final.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.948" offset="603199">He in effect did take a new trial on June 6, 1966, and on June 7, 1966, was convicted of armed robbery, assault with intent to murder and larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.538" offset="661504">It is the irony of this case that the second judge chose to increase the sentence for the same charge for which the petitioner had been convicted in both cases, that is armed robbery and then imposed to suspend it, concurrent 10-year sentences on the other charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.643" offset="733915">I say in all frankness that had not judge -- had Judge Pugh run the other sentences consecutively and left the sentence for armed robbery at 12 years, I would not be standing here today, I would really have no case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.399" offset="785011">Be that as it may, Judge Pugh did see fit to increase the sentence on the identical charge for which the petitioner had received 12-years to 20-years at his second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.502" offset="829419">This Court, when it granted certiorari last June, ordered me to argue the question of retroactivity of North Carolina versus Pearce.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.474" offset="1001305">If I may proceed Your Honor as to the question of retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.222" offset="1020217">I believe as a practical matter that -- may I state at the outset that I am not urging the Court as a practical matter that every decision of this Court should be made retroactive and I'm not here to push that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.972" offset="1071208">My argument of course is only that under the facts of this case and the criteria which this Court has outlined, particularly in Stovall versus Denno, Desist versus United States that the three criteria of the purpose of the new rule, reliance on the old rule and the burden on the administration of justice fully justify a completely retroactive effect to this case before the Court today, that is Moon.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.962" offset="1171205">I would like to say further Your Honor that I do not believe that there is in effect a new rule so that the question of retroactivity I believe is at least -- that this is not a retroactive case in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.493" offset="1225331">I would say to the Court that North Carolina versus Pearce was a case of first impression to this Court and I intend to argue it later to that effect that it is not in any change in the law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.653" offset="1277994">It certainly in the petitioner's opinion is not a change in the laws expounded by United States versus Ball or Stroud versus United States, but was a new case.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.512" offset="1325432">I would also state that under the facts of this case, the three criteria stated for instance, the purpose of the new rule in this case as I understand it is to allow a free and uninhibited right to appellate review in the state and federal courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.237" offset="1400351">Certainly, this purpose and the Court has so stated in Stovall I believe that this purpose is controlling unless the questions of reliance or burden are such as to overcome it.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.205" offset="1448208">I submit to the Court that those factors are not of such a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.932" offset="1471091">I would say this as to reliance that the Court in Benton for instance talked about collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.165" offset="1500035">Now the state may have -- I would say first the state had no old rule to rely on and I will approach that in later.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.241" offset="1532322">Since they had no right rule to rely on, even if they did rely on the Maryland law, and of course they would argue that, there was no controlling United States case with them to rely on and assuming that there were under the doctrine of estoppel, they did not change their position to their detriment because of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.313" offset="1608600">And if the Court will note at page 38 of the state's brief, they concede that of the 85 persons retried who that is, were reconvicted under Schowgurow, 11 of them received increased sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.307" offset="1672652">Now, projecting as a practical matter, Maryland's population is 4% of the national population, that would mean approximately 550 prisoners in the state prisons in this country who would be re-sentenced.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.721" offset="1990301">So perhaps my figures are at least subject to challenge, but I submit that the number of cases involved in the state courts cannot be that great and in particular, the burden on any one state is to justify the reliance on a rule which might been Your Honor does not exist in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.136" offset="2515884">But as I read the cases cited by the Court there, I do not believe that they stand for the proposition which the Court feels it does or at least the plurality opinion in Pearce says that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.538" offset="2565517">I have read the briefs in the Stroud case and counsel was arguing there and as it's in my brief, that since Stroud had been put in jeopardy at a former trial, he could not even be retried again for the same offense, that is murder and I believe -- say with respect to the Court that that is exactly what the Stroud case stands for and I believe Murphy versus Massachusetts, Ball versus United States, all stand for roughly that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.953" offset="2695189">That is that the fact of an acquittal or the fact of a reversal does not in any way prohibit retrial for the same offense and I'm certainly not saying that to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="707.388" offset="2932903">And I've read Stroud and I'm convinced that that's what this Court was deciding in Stroud that there was no reason not to retry him a third time.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.060" offset="2971564">If I may proceed then as to the question of the double jeopardy argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.981" offset="2999254">As to double jeopardy, I know that this Court has in Pearce decided that the double jeopardy argument is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.945" offset="3059127">May I say respectfully that a close reading of the language of the Fifth Amendment and of the study since then and in fact the first draft of James Madison's article for the Fifth Amendment in which Mr. Madison stated that there should be no more than one punishment nor one crime, nor one trial for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.208" offset="3168214">Unfortunately, as I understand it from the article, there was so much confusion as to whether punishment mean they couldn't be retried, exactly the Stroud question that Mr. Madison was forced to change his original language.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.869" offset="3226833">I think very frankly Your Honor that the language, the cases which I feel are applicable to this case are not Ball and not Stroud, but ex parte Lang in 18 Wallace and United States versus Benz in which this Court said in ex parte Lang that the reality of trial is not the trial itself, but the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.952" offset="3319202">And I might say to the Court, I've only been in practice of law seven years, but I have never had a case in which I've -- in which the overwhelming desire and concern of the prisoner was not the punishment involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.900" offset="3378970">I know that there maybe some cases where because of security clearance or professional reputation, the conviction is the man would do anything to avoid a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.962" offset="3419199">But as a practical matter, I submit that in -- at least in my experience, 90% of the appeals that go to the state and federal appellate courts in this country are in some way related to the issue of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.310" offset="3468622">I think that as the ultimate reality of criminal law and I think very frankly to separate double jeopardy from trial, from double jeopardy as far as it concerns, the sentence is to do -- is to incorrectly judge in my opinion the clear language of the Fifth Amendment because it says in jeopardy of -- nor shall not twice be put in jeopardy not by conviction, but of life and limb that is punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.683" offset="3586069">And I submit that -- Your Honor that the state has raised several questions about, well, if you extended it to a flat prohibition, what would happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="880.381" offset="3624939">You'd have everybody appealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.408" offset="3632985">We -- I have statistics Your Honor that show that in some circuits, the rate of appeal is approaching 90% now.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.836" offset="3662764">Under the uniform code of military justice for a crime involving of more than one year imprisonment, you have two automatic reviews, automatic, you don't even have to request them.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.367" offset="3704874">I submit further that the state is apparently been saying all along that the second trial judge sits de novo and accordingly, he has the right to substitute his judgment for that of the first judge because the first judgment has ceased to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.780" offset="3774464">If I recall the language of the Court in Pearce, is that the first judgment, the first sentence insofar does not conserve becomes a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.515" offset="3813439">I submit with all due respect that this nullity argument simply is not -- cannot be distinguished from the argument in Pearce at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.147" offset="3855966">It cannot be made -- it is not consistent with the rest of the argument in Pearce.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.510" offset="3873416">I cited for instance in my brief and I would very much like the State of Maryland to answer this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.959" offset="3899225">Reeves versus State, 3 Maryland Appeal 195, where the defendant had served some six years of a sentence, of 20 years if I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.388" offset="3940916">He then got a new trial and got 20 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.689" offset="3958157">Now, the Court said, we agree that this is a de novo proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.726" offset="3974248">We agree the slate as wiped clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.426" offset="3985115">We agree that if the former sentence is a nullity, but you still can't sentence a man to 26 years on a 20-year maximum charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.459" offset="4017194">As I said to the Court of Appeals when I argued this, I said I defy, I didn't say I defy, I said I would like the Court to explain the distinction between its rationale in Moon and its rationale in Reeves.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.042" offset="4067558">If the former sentence is a nullity, then it seizes to exist and if the man gets another maximum sentence, it's perfectly proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.868" offset="4098800">Now, this is the logical extension of the Reeves decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.785" offset="4114474">The Court of Appeals of Maryland declined to hear that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.805" offset="4126595">The state asked for certiorari and they simply did not take the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.600" offset="4141746">And I well say when I was arguing the case, one of the judges on the Court of Appeals said, he saw nothing wrong with that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.370" offset="4164838">The man got a de novo trial and got another 20 years and wound up serving 26 years on the 20 year charge, that was perfectly alright because the former sentence was a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.387" offset="4204962">I submit with respect to the Court that you cannot consider a sentence as a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.433" offset="4229099">It is there and it is why most appeals are taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.068" offset="4247594">Now, the courts in the State of Maryland, and the Maryland Courts have said that and they've cited from other cases that on appeal, the trial judge -- the Court of Appeals will reverse a sentence if it is excessive and they feel that it violates liberty and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.705" offset="4322200">Now, Your Honor, my set of the Maryland reports go back to 1682, I believe, that's the nominatives of Maryland and they have recently stated that there is no case on record in which the Court of Appeals of Maryland has ever reduced a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.880" offset="4378937">And in fact, I submit to the Court to the best of anyone's knowledge in the entire, almost 300 years of the appellate procedure in Maryland, not a single case has ever been reversed because the appellate court felt that the trial judge had been too harsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.674" offset="4434108">Now in fact, in the last few years, the Maryland legislature has seen fit to establish a new procedure for appellate review sentence under Rule 762, the Maryland rules of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.008" offset="4483427">This involves a three-man bench of which the sentencing judge is one and he may then -- they may then either increase the sentence, leave it alone or decrease it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.014" offset="4527417">Now, it seems to me that this is the ultimate issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.336" offset="4540688">The State of Maryland has now recognized that there is a division between the appeal of the trial and the appeal of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.044" offset="4575587">And if we can -- I'm asking this Court to recognize that distinction in Pearce that I am asking this Court to accept what I believe was the logical extension of Green versus United States and the very fine article by professor Ben Olstein about this problem which I've cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.744" offset="4654373">And in Green, if we -- if the Court will accept the idea of implicit acquittal insofar as the trial goes, then I see nothing wrong and in fact I think it's perfectly logical to say that there has been an implicit acquittal insofar as any higher sentence goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.684" offset="4722082">In other words, that court has established the maximum sentence and upon retrial, while there maybe another sentence obviously, it cannot exceed that valid sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.849" offset="4766804">I'm asking the Court in other words to face what I consider is the reality of appeals that almost every appeal is a somehow an appeal of the sentence and that because our courts do not recognize that on appeal, somehow error has to be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.320" offset="4840678">I would venture to this Court that if you promise every prisoner in a -- in any jail in the United States that he would be released if he dropped his appeal, I would venture that 90% of them would drop the appeal immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.280" offset="4900446">And I would venture further that if you release them and said you can ahead with your appeal, it doesn't matter, they still would drop their appeal because we are faced here and I know this Court is facing other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.303" offset="4944541">We just heard one about -- I think that the sentencing area is the most sensitive area that this Court must now resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.219" offset="4976201">I know that there is a capital punishment case set.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.600" offset="4985814">I know North Carolina versus Alfred is set very soon, or has been already argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.999" offset="5007339">This, it is now -- I think the courts, particularly this Court in Pearce have finally faced this entire area of sentencing and punishment and that is the ultimate reality of the law of this case and the law of every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.602" offset="5065749">There is no good reason not to apply North Carolina versus Pearce retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.920" offset="5095006">What is going to be the burden on the administration of justice?</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.183" offset="5108067">Almost nominal, not one guilty person is going to be turned lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.221" offset="5124263">If every prisoner in the state came under this rule and I say it is only 11, if every prisoner came, what would happen, he would be brought back to the sentencing Court and sentenced in accordance with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.889" offset="5174941">I do not consider that an undue burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.103" offset="5183822">Not one person is going to go free because of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.525" offset="5201481">As to reliance upon the old rule, we've already discussed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.884" offset="5214960">I submit very respectfully, there is no old rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.344" offset="5228753">So that is why I contend that the question of retroactivity does not even apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.504" offset="5249337">Because I know in Desist the Court talked about changes in the law and a clear break with the old law, but there is no old law to break with in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.732" offset="5286327">If it please the Court, I'm saving some of the time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1342.163" offset="5472005">I think the Pearce case held that while the sentence is a nullity on the first conviction, the time actually served cannot be a nullity, and this is exactly what the Court of the Special Appeals held not in those exact terms, but in that case since Reeves had been given a life sentence, he had spent 6 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.290" offset="5572524">The second time around, when it was reversed in the federal court, he received a 20 year sentence, it was a crime of rape and the judge gave him 20 years but did not take in to consideration the fact that Mr. Reeves had actually spent 6 years in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.779" offset="5650474">And so therefore, the Court of Special Appeals held that this was in effect increase in the statutory sentence of 20 years that Reeves was entitled to and they reversed the case and our Court of Appeals for their own reasons did not grant cert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.564" offset="5717661">The state, Mr. Jacques is correct, the state took a cert in that case insofar as we were trying to resolve the question of Moon which was pending in the Court of Appeals at that time, Reeves and also another case, Williams versus State dealing with jail time, that is the time a defendant spends in jail pending the trial as differentiated from sentence time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.987" offset="5843362">Now, as to the statistics that we quote on page 38, had no time to mean to infer that this 11 increased sentence applies to all retrials in the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.765" offset="5906474">This is limited as indicated in the brief only to Schowgurow cases, not to cases that have been reversed because of double jeopardy problems, evidentiary problems and a variety of reversals that come through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.324" offset="5976691">This is only limited and it was only entered into the statistics of finding out this to contradict this philosophy, this pragmatic philosophy that judges on the second trial will vindictively, systematically is the word that's used in the Law Review article that is Duke Law Journal systematically would increase sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.933" offset="6087137">This would indicate that in Maryland on the Schowgurow that out of the 85 cases that we were able to come up with retrials, 61 got it a decrease in sentence, that's 72%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.115" offset="6143875">Now and incidentally, this was not a figure on the sentence itself because that's only one consideration determined whether he may and got a decrease in sentence, you must determine the date of his first sentence to make sure that the second sentence covers that same period of time and this was figured on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.789" offset="6230497">Someone could get a lesser sentence but in effect served more time, if he did not get credit for the time served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.397" offset="6268949">Now, I think that the question here in view of the Pearce decision by this honorable Court, the question before us today is based on the premise that the Pearce Court held that on a retrial, a man can get a heavier sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.610" offset="6353795">The main fear -- there was two problems there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.560" offset="6373648">One was credit for time served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.351" offset="6384828">The other was the fear of the vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.437" offset="6417115">So therefore, I think it's incumbent to question before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.494" offset="6437386">One of the questions is whether the trial record of the second trial would support the fact that Judge Pugh, sentencing judge had ample reasons or was his sentence, not necessarily just a file, or that could be a question of debate but whether it was given in conformity with the evidence of that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.295" offset="6548564">And certainly, it has been the law in Maryland at all times since 1896 in the Mitchell case that if a judge sentenced for an improper motive, death sentence should be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.269" offset="6608436">We would say that a vindictive purpose on the part of the judge in penalizing the man for taking an appeal is certainly an unworthy to note and it should be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.028" offset="6659532">Now, I would -- well, no question has been raised as to the guilt of this particular man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.526" offset="6693491">I think it's essential that a factual outline of the crime should be brought to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.743" offset="6722330">This was a prosecution for armed robbery and assault with intent to murder and larceny of a female hardware clerk who was on her way to deposit money in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.196" offset="6776142">This was in broad daylight in the shopping center just to the northwest of here and as she was walking to that bank, she was attacked by the defendant Moon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.567" offset="6825671">The evidence will indicate that he struck her and beat her to the ground with a lead pipe that he had fashioned the night before by putting tar tape around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.479" offset="6873318">He was a former coworker of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.175" offset="6892022">He knew the victim, the victim knew him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.168" offset="6904038">So it was essential to this operation of this crime that she could not be able to identify him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.473" offset="6933295">And that's exactly he was successful because the beating was so severe that this woman could not identify Moon at the first trial and could not identify him at the second trial two years later because she was suffering from amnesia brought on by this brutal beating about the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.044" offset="7015528">Now, so the first trial, the judge at the first trial had before him the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.765" offset="7042382">He had a witness to the peer, this victim who said that she couldn't remember any of the details.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.835" offset="7078745">This was six months after the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.317" offset="7096613">She had lost her memory and she couldn't -- all she could tell him was the name of her physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.954" offset="7119182">The blackout on this young lady was from five-day period, the day before to a mere four days thereafter the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.956" offset="7159202">She couldn't remember or give any details, so the first trial was limited to a description of her injury by people that found her laying on the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.234" offset="7204342">In addition, after the evidence, it was a jury trial, it took two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.278" offset="7228479">The defendant when he was called or took the stand in his own behalf, he admitted -- he admitted that he made the weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.371" offset="7268812">He also admitted that he was there at the shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.770" offset="7290441">He admitted striking the lady.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.013" offset="7303398">In reading the record, you will come to the conclusion, there is a tone of remorse and regret that as he stated this and that he was sorry that he hurt her, that he liked her and he did not want to hurt her.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.243" offset="7368391">Yes sir and the point of bringing this out is to the difference in sentence, all judges vary well not all, but there is a despairing sentencing and it's unfortunate but as long as we have human beings to sentence people rather than computers, we are going to have disparity of sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.199" offset="7448116">Now, so Mr. Moon was convicted and got 12 years and as Mr. Jacques has indicated, he recited the chronological order that it was reversed because of Schowgurow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.846" offset="7498794">Now, what took place at the second trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.123" offset="7511855">The second trial, two years later, the woman comes in and she testifies again and she is -- has continued to have amnesia as to this five-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.718" offset="7562219">She testified that she is still under the doctor's care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.109" offset="7579773">Two years later, still under medical care, at this trial, the doctor appears and he testifies as to the medical description of the terms that she was suffering among other things, a cerebral concussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.612" offset="7645811">At this time, it was a jury trial that took two days incidentally and at this time, Moon did not take the stand, that's what his privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.723" offset="7690219">At the conclusion of the trial, the judge or the jury rather found him guilty, guilty of -- it's very true, guilty of armed robbery, guilty of larceny and guilty of assault with intent to murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.500" offset="7753331">The assault with intent to murder was not brought at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.787" offset="7770572">Now, when the -- Moon was asked by the Court, "Would you -- do you have anything you would like to say before I enter sentence?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.690" offset="7810173">He was also asked or the Court asked defense counsel whether they want a pre-sentence report and that was turned down and they wanted sentence there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.672" offset="7850088">Moon took the stand and testified that as to why the Court should be lenient was because he did not commit the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.860" offset="7902856">He was not there and he denied hitting the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.301" offset="7932531">The Court wasn't -- should grin at this, it didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.970" offset="7947264">The defense counsel if you read the record, will indicate that the defense counsel said, well didn't you say at the first trial that you were there and so forth and so forth to which he denied and he said that he was high on narcotic drugs at the time of the first trial and I might add that pain relieving narcotics drug because he did have a -- some difficulty with his leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.684" offset="8070144">Now, then the Court questioned him about this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.967" offset="10511235">In addition, the Court of Appeals of Maryland went into this and the Court of Appeals of Maryland found this as a fact and this is recorded of course in their decision that there was no indication that the trial judge increased Moon sentence because he had elected to have a new trial or for any other unworthy or improper motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.955" offset="10615202">Now, the question as -- moving on to the question of retroactivity, the only thing that possibly the retroactivity appears is to this particular case would be the procedural rule which was enunciated by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.963" offset="10683225">Now whenever a judge impose a more severe sentence upon the defendant after his new trial, the reason must be affirmative -- affirmatively appealed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2765.971" offset="11167222">Now, I would maintain that since -- that the rule itself should not be retroactive and citing the but -- now my time is running out, but citing the three purposes that this Court has used to measure retroactivity that certainly there is no question as to the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.953" offset="11267218">The purpose would not be served by making it a retroactive because it is to ensure that every defendant it was given a harsher sentence on retrial is not given that sentence out of vindictiveness and were to alleviate the fear of vindictiveness and its chilling effect by spreading it on the record so that the appellate judge or a reviewing court can see that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.752" offset="11358333">Now, you cannot say and I quote with our statistics would indicate that all persons that received additional time did not receive that out of vindictiveness and that the evil sought to be remedied by the new procedural rules herein, does not per se exist in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.882" offset="11446941">Plus the fact that the defendant does have a remedy still under collateral proceedings, post conviction and/or habeas corpus on it, although admitted difficult to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.993" offset="11507336">I agree with Mr. Justice Stewart that the question of reliance upon the fact that a court did not have to set forth the reasons would be based in Stroud versus United States and also in our own state on Hoves versus Maryland and the Mitchell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.605" offset="11609840">I -- we do present some problems as to the effect on the administration of justice, exactly how that this rule is applied retroactively, how is the procedure going to be setup, is -- that the new judge give a sentence based on the record or the transcript?</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.332" offset="11700746">Does he just assume the old sentence which this Court has held that has been nullified and it presents a great many, the problems that must be faced and it could best be left unanswered by making it the rule itself prospectively rather than -- and prospectively from June 23, 1969, the date of the Pearce decision, thank you.</text>
