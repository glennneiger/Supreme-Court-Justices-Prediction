            <text syncTime="328.930" offset="1419055">Here, what we have to rely on is the petitioner's affidavit, there's nothing in the Government's affidavit in opposition, it's simply a general statement to which you have added one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.915" offset="1467016">In argument before District Judge Weinstein, Government counsel, and this is at pages 31 (a) and 32 (a), states that one of these very agents was at a (Inaudible) there the weekend before and he saw what looked to him to have been refilled bottles and so he went and put in a routine complaint which was being acted on this following Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.982" offset="1583313">Now, that's all there is in the record, the petition does say they broke in.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.288" offset="1612570">Now, what particular implement they used to break they did break a lock, there's no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.573" offset="1645693">As a matter of fact, the Government admits in its brief that this is the only case to their knowledge and this is at their brief page 30 note 26, this is the only case to their knowledge where force has been used to gain entry to the premises of a retail liquor dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.272" offset="1724479">So, force was used but whether it was a hammer or whether it was crowbar that I can't tell you Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.393" offset="1840985">Now, they weren't seeking to look for an elicit distillery because if they had been doing that, there is an expressed statutory provision which says that it shall be lawful for them to use such a force to gain entry as maybe necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.089" offset="1903679">Now, whatever maybe the constitutional status of that provision its there, they weren't operating under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.342" offset="1928756">They were simply as I have stated and I can emphasize it too much they were engaged in a general exploratory search of the kind that was one of the factors involved in the American revolution and which was the kind of thing that led to the adoption of the Fourth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment contains no exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="870.111" offset="3583770">Mr. Chief Justice Burger, may I answer that by calling attention to the fact that there is a comparable provision in the case of distilleries where the statute provides that agents may enter -- the Government agents are supposed to have a key to distilleries, they may go in at any time and the statute specifically provides that if entry is denied they may use necessary force without a warrant to get in.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.711" offset="3702262">Now, entirely apart from the question of -- if you would add to your case that the statute also says in the case of these atomic plants that agents may enter and I mean if you'll make the case comparable to that of distilleries and say that the statute specifically provides that if entry is denied they may use force to enter, I would say that I would have a great deal of that about the constitutionality of that but I would equally say in this case if you look at the statutory structure, you'd have to come to the conclusion that under this inspection statute, that result wouldn't follow because under this inspection statute, there are provisions for forfeiture of $500.00 for each refusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.144" offset="3895986">There's another provision making it a felony to obstruct internal revenue agents in carrying out their duties but where the Congress had in mind a warrant procedure, it specifically so provided and so it provided and this provision goes back, it was in the 1791 Act, it's in the revised statute and it's in the current Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.370" offset="3992848">It's in 26 USC Section 7302 which provides a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.618" offset="4013850">If property is used or maybe used or has been used in violation of the revenue laws specifically provides a search warrant may issue as provided in chapter 205 of title 18 of the United States Code and the federal rules of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.030" offset="4079470">Now, there's also a provision in two instances for the use of force in the congressional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.919" offset="4103084">There's one in the criminal code 18 USC Section 3109 which provides for the use of necessary force in the execution of a warrant, and there's another provision, there's one with reference to distilleries which provides for the use of necessary force without a warrant for the entry of a distillery, but there is no such provision with reference to these inspection statutes and I say just as a matter of statutory construction, this is now a part from the Fourth Amendment but as a matter of statutory construction if you look at this statutory scheme, Congress never intended the use of force if entry was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.583" offset="4253654">They intended the use of a warrant procedure and there is specific provision for a warrant procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.637" offset="4277896">Now, I'm not familiar with the atomic energy provisions but I would say this that if there was a specific provision for entry without a warrant by the use of force if necessary, you'd have something that's comparable to what we have with reference to distilleries, I would doubt its constitutionality under the Fourth Amendment and I'll explain in a moment why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.293" offset="4368593">And if you had also in that statute a provision for a warrant procedure, I might form an opinion looking at the statutory scheme, I would if I could come up by saying that the Fourth Amendment protected it I would and I would do that for this reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="1155.575" offset="4725635">There are now over two dozen federal administrative agencies which have either the power of subpoena or the power of inspection of both and I say in the face of that trend, it is necessary not to make them exception to the Fourth Amendment where all that you have are inspection statutes and where in that same statutory scheme you have a provision for a warrant procedure as you do, you'd have a provision for a forfeiture if there is a refusal and you'll have two provisions for the use of force, one in the execution of a warrant and one where you want to enter a distillery, neither of which are applicable to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.982" offset="6295280">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.077" offset="6307715">I'd like at the outset the point the specific statutory framework under which the agents proceeded in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.879" offset="6338853">That's set forth at page 37 of our appendix, its title 265146 (b) of the Code and it says, “entry of premises for inspection, the secretary or his delegate may enter during business hours, the premises including places of storage of any dealer for the purpose of inspecting or examining any records or other documents required to be kept by such dealer under this chapter and any distilled spirits, wines or beer kept or stored by such dealer on such premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.079" offset="6483675">These two things clearly emerge from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.368" offset="6496841">We are not here talking about breaking of outer doors at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.821" offset="6514604">These are premises which are open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.548" offset="6529546">The excise tax, the occupational stamp tax is paid by the bar owner, the package store in Colonnade Catering Corporation which services parties and the actual inspection here occurred when the officers entered the premises with the consent of the employees there in charge, made an inspection of a public area and what we're talking about here is the breaking of a storeroom in the basement which as admitted no one was in there except liquor bottles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.479" offset="6673324">Contrasting that situation with the See and Camara, as this Court will recall, both See and Camara dealt with broad housing and fire code provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.903" offset="6718986">We've set out some of these provisions at page 18 of our brief, note 16 which gave wide discretion to the agent in the field as this Court pointed out neither the resident in Camara nor the owner in See had anyway of knowing whether the inspection of these premises was required to enforce the ordinance, did not know the nature or limits of the inspector's authority and did not know whether the inspector's attempt to gain entry stemmed from proper authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.819" offset="6838627">Indeed, it was only by facing a criminal prosecution the Court went on, that the validity of the entry could be put to a test and even then the owner of the premises or the occupant might never learn the reason for the entry, and this Court ruled that was precisely the kind of unfettered discretion of the officer in the field to invade private premises that required antecedent justification by a neutral judicial officer as to specifically delimit and make precise and give official sanction to the entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.430" offset="6981047">The Court went on in Camara to say broad statutory safeguards were no substitute for individual life review in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.827" offset="7018663">As we have noted this statute is clearly at the opposite end of the spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.297" offset="7044577">It is a specific as the Fourth Amendment itself can require it under the warrant procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.094" offset="7067773">Specifically describes the place to be inspected, business premises during business hours and the things to be inspected, liquor bottles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.756" offset="7110405">These agents have no authority to roam at large for anything else but liquor bottles and to examine that the specific records which the dealer has to keep.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.803" offset="7154604">The dealer had a -- as a matter of fact, the 1791 statute which was enacted the year of the Fourth Amendment which authorized inspection of the premises of breweries and importers, it was in that provision, the right to inspect as well as the right to look at the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.525" offset="7237465">The Court in Camara and See are floated further that there was no showing nor even any argument in those cases that a warrant system would in any way hamper effective implementation of these municipal codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.717" offset="7302248">And finally it observed there were manageable broad standards for these types of area inspection warrants by which the magistrate could determine if a particular area inspection at a particular time was warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.121" offset="7359822">Considerations of these very same factors, the scope of the inspection authority, the knowledge of the owner of the premises, the public interest in this inspection and the standards to be applied by the magistrate all point we submit to a contrary ruling in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.870" offset="7674859">What I meant to say was these places, this which have at some occasion you see, have an initial kind of entry area where coats are hung, and then they have -- you walk down a hall to this large ballroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.594" offset="7733791">What I'm suggesting is that in this case, the agents entered this entry hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.085" offset="7755734">The record shows that at that time they were authorized and permitted to inspect the general area of the ballroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.334" offset="7792724">They didn't walk in to the ballroom as a matter of fact, they just looked inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.813" offset="7806621">They then wanted to look at the basement, they made clear what their purpose was to inspect for liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.382" offset="7836923">They said -- they said we're not in consent to looking at the basement, nevertheless they went down and looked in the basement at the cellar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.895" offset="7866911">There was -- 75 feet away from the ballroom was the storeroom in which the Colonnade kept its liquor, it was this that was broken in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.105" offset="7915813">More than that may I suggest to Your Honor that to the extent that there was privacy, it was the privacy within the ballroom, the cloakroom area, the initial entry area was clearly open and there's no claim here that these premises were not open to the public or that this wasn't during business hours.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.972" offset="11787264">Then, I suppose that the president of that bank has locked in his desk, in his office certain papers and those bank examiners want to go in that locked desk, I would say there they would have to go and get a warrant based on probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2992.058" offset="12071581">As you know the whole statutory scheme providing for bank examination is that the examiners must take the banker by surprise?</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.262" offset="12140440">Now, Mr. Justice Stewart, you asked about the food and drug administration and I find in the Government's brief, my associate called my attention to it but I remember that I had read it, in Footnote 23 in the second paragraph where they say, we are advised that when food and drug administration inspectors are denied entry, they seek to obtain a warrant before returning to the premises sought to be inspected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.101" offset="12243780">Now, you also asked about the premises, I think we've given you as much help as we can on that although I did notice in looking at the petition in paragraph one, the petitioner does allege that this is his principal place of business and that's engaged in the catering business, I think it does mean that you come and engage, this is his private property and the people are there in a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.448" offset="12349210">Now, Mr. Justice Marshall, you asked specifically how they broke in and I went through the record again while I was listening to the Government's argument and I see on page 21 (a) of the appendix, says the investigators forcibly broke into the storeroom actually tearing the door latch from the door frame, but that's specific as I can be on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.277" offset="12480449">And Mr. Chief Justice, I do want to come back to your example of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.585" offset="12501661">I know that bank examiners are supposed to take the bank by surprise but I would have to look at the whole statutory scheme and if there is some way that I could argue that the Fourth Amendment warrant procedure should be applicable I would do so because I think in accordance with our own Courts as a people or to borrow the phrase of Mr. Chief Justice Warren, If we continue as a maturing society which he used in Trump against Dallas, in this day of these proliferating administrative agencies, if I could find an argument that I could make with my heart I would make it that there should be a certain area that's safeguarded to the individual free from intrusion by the state unless there is a specific provision for it and that surely doesn't exist in this case.</text>
