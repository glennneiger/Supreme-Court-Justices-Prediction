            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 477, Atlantic Coast Line against Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.807" offset="230588">Mr. Friedmann, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank X. Friedman Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="35.259" offset="244381">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.792" offset="262562">Due to the intricate litigation, which is in the background of this case, and the complex factual setting as well as the unique procedural vehicle which was employed by the respondent Brotherhoods below, we will, with the Court's permission, make first a separate and distinct statement of the facts and of the procedural setting in this case, which will then be followed by Mr. Lyons's argument of the law as applied to those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.945" offset="399130">First to the background and the physical setting which we're dealing with; Physically, we are dealing with the property of three separate railroad carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.593" offset="445733">First, the Florida East Coast Railway; The Florida East Coast property is located in large part to the south of the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida, although, it is bounded on the north by the north bank of the St. Johns River.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.472" offset="521279">The second parcel of the property we are dealing with is located to the north of the FEC property, and that property is of the Jacksonville Terminal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.207" offset="564224">Thirdly, the property which is directly involved here is the Moncrief Yard located again north of the Jacksonville Terminal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.007" offset="607378">By way of background and in highly capsule form if I may, in January, 1963, the FEC non-operating employees went on strike and began to picket the FEC property.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.943" offset="675192">In May of 1966, these pickets moved up the land and across the St. Johns River and began to picket the Jacksonville Terminal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.416" offset="716988">Two series of litigation resulted from that picketing, both of which came before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.303" offset="744573">First, the Jacksonville Terminal Company sought an injunction and was granted an injunction in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.092" offset="771741">That injunction was reversed due to the Bar of Norris-LaGuardia by the Fifth Circuit and this Court affirmed full forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.872" offset="802879">Secondly, the Jacksonville Terminal Company sought an injunction in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.790" offset="822523">That injunction was granted and in March of last year, this Court reversed by a four- three decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.594" offset="857736">In the meantime however, and in April, 1967, the FEC pickets again moved up the land and placed pickets around the ACL's Moncrief Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.479" offset="925236">Moncrief Yard, the facility which is involved in this case is a wholly-owned piece of property or a piece of property wholly owned by the ACL which is devoted primarily to classification and secondarily to the interchange of traffic with connecting carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.149" offset="1007992">Classification as the term implies is the simple act of breaking down a road train which comes in to the yard, putting it into its separate classes and putting it in a road train which goes out of the yard, it comes in ACL and goes out ACL.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.661" offset="1078000">The interchange procedure, which is used by FEC and ACL in Moncrief Yard is also quite similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.481" offset="1105272">The FEC with its locomotives and employees bring cars across the St. Johns River north, across the Jacksonville Terminal Company, and drop them on a previously designated track in Moncrief Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.881" offset="1162846">And on occasions, they pick up cars from Moncrief Yard and take them back to their own classification yard south of the river, back on the yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.378" offset="1200880">The operating procedure which exists as to Moncrief Yard as well as the relationship between ACL and FEC is, we respectfully submit, totally distinguishable from the situation which existed in the case decided by this Court in March of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.312" offset="1284577">In the first place, the FEC owns no part of the ACL stock or no part of ACL property.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.275" offset="1320521">Secondly, the FEC obviously owns no part of Moncrief Yard and had no interest, ownership wise in Moncrief Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.183" offset="1352077">The FEC exercises no discretion in either the overall management of ACL or in the management and operation of Moncrief Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.263" offset="1392410">The ACL does not maintain or repair any FEC cars and engines, And very importantly, we submit in this case, no FEC employee reports to or leaves from work at the picketed premises Moncrief Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.405" offset="1469001">The 1967 picketing, which is in issue here, took place at the ACL employee entrance into Moncrief Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.965" offset="1515186">The request, which was made by picket signs, pamphlets and apparently by telephone calls during the night was for ACL employees to go to work, but refuse to perform the functions which they normally perform in that yard, namely classify and interchange cars which are the sole property of ACL.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.313" offset="1600658">There are at least three points which we believe should be made insofar as the picketing is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.340" offset="1628766">First, there's no relationship between the picketing, which took place at Moncrief Yard in the presence of FEC in that yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.950" offset="1671189">Secondly, the intent of the Brotherhood is obvious and was expressed by the highest official insofar as the strike is concerned, and that is to close the ACL because the ACL was doing business with the FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.552" offset="1729599">Thirdly, picketing was designed to force ACL employees to quit performing work, which they normally did for the ACL.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.911" offset="1779022">As to the relationship between the picketing and the FEC presence in the yard, there was no relationship in time between the picketing and the FEC presence in the yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.976" offset="1823326">They picketed when the ACL employees came to work and this was not necessarily at all at the time when FEC employees or engines might be in Moncrief Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.275" offset="1868466">There was no relationship in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.914" offset="1879019">The effect of this picketing was to cause ACL employees to cease to handle ACL cars and in many instances, cars which were never –- or never originated or were not destined to FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.105" offset="1943803">Separation is practical in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.109" offset="1955819">There are more than one place at which these FEC employees could be picketed and the intent was expressed by the head Brotherhood man insofar as this strike is concerned, and I quote from the appendix at page 31, “He was going to shut down the coastline railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.774" offset="2050487">” It was in this factual situation that the rather unique procedural complexity arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.963" offset="2091238">First in 1967, the ACL filed a complaint in Federal Court based solely on Federal law and sought a temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.249" offset="2136377">That motion or request for a temporary restraining order was denied on the grounds of the Bar of Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.058" offset="2167620">This action lay dormant from April 26, 1967 to May 23, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.149" offset="2203982">Subsequently, the ACL filed suit in the state court, requesting an injunction solely under state law, that injunction was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.000" offset="2251421">In March, 1969, this Court handed down its opinion in Trainmen versus Jacksonville Terminal and it's the chronology of subsequent events with which this Court is primarily concerned today.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.162" offset="2303979">First, the Brotherhood moved to dissolve the state court injunction, which had been handed down in 1967 and noticed a hearing for May 23, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.510" offset="2349432">Virtually, while this hearing was going on in state court, on the Brotherhood motion to dissolve the injunction, a handwritten answer was filed by the Brotherhood in the dormant Federal Case, and a copy of that answer is found in the appendix at page 163.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.309" offset="2440652">A second full hearing on the merits was held in State Court and Judge Lackey then issued a letter opinion which indicated that he would deny the Brotherhood's motion to dissolve the state court injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.216" offset="2496240">It was then that the Brotherhood filed a motion in the dormant federal case in Federal Court requesting that the federal district judge in effect enjoin the state court from enforcing its injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.361" offset="2560815">And the grounds of the motion were, and I quote from the appendix at page 186, to enjoin ACL from availing itself of the state court injunction “pending final hearing and determination of this [the federal action].</text>
            <text syncTime="633.469" offset="2637197">” The ACL attempted to have the federal action finally determined and in fact, immediately filed a notice of dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.395" offset="2668962">The ACL stated in open court that it was willing to have its complaint and its case dismissed with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.830" offset="2702712">The Brotherhood objected to a dismissal with prejudice, even though they had not in their handwritten answer sought any affirmative or counter relief, and the challenged order was entered on June 19, 1969, which one; denied the ACL the right to dismiss its complaint with prejudice and two; enjoined the state court from enforcing the 1967 injunction pending final hearing, in a case in which we respectfully submit there was nothing left to finally hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.075" offset="2855685">We did however seek a final hearing and we were denied a final hearing and it is subsequent to that that we felt these appellate proceedings were commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.717" offset="2898213">In conclusion as to the facts and the procedural setting which gave rise to this case, we would respectfully submit that the procedural vehicle of a federal district judge enjoining a state court used by the Brotherhood in this case is unique and does constitute a serious and we believe a grave threat to continued federal state judicial relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.880" offset="3026944">The ACL sought injunctive relief in federal court in 1967, and that relief was denied because the Court was barred from acting under Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.607" offset="3073755">The Brotherhood did not and has never sought any counter or affirmative relief in that case, and the federal court did not determine and could not determine the legality of the picketing in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.397" offset="3133001">Subsequently, the Brotherhood contends that somehow, the district –- the Federal District Court in negatively denying the ACL's requested relief, affirmatively determined that the picketing was legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.954" offset="3199143">It was not however until after the Brotherhood had failed to prevail in state court on its motion to dissolve the state court injunction that the Brotherhood took steps to enjoin the state court to “protect” the jurisdiction of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.710" offset="3278242">We respectfully submit that the intent was obvious and the effect was obvious, and that was to subvert the appellate processes of the state of Florida, avoid normal appellate procedures in the state of Florida, and to seek directly a review of a state court circuit judge decision by a federal district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.411" offset="3373014">And it is that error legally, which with the Court's permission, Mr. Lyons will commence discussing at this time, thank you.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="833.611" stopTime="834.626">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="833.611" offset="3437798">Mr. Lyons?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis G. Lyons</label>
            <text syncTime="834.626" offset="3441873">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.914" offset="3455039">This case is quite different from the previous cases involving the attempts of the Railway Brotherhoods to involve the neutral carriers in their seven-year labor dispute with the FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.789" offset="3526510">The basic point of difference is that this is the first case which involves an injunction granted out of the courts in one of our concurrent jurisdictions, the federal jurisdiction, against proceedings in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.933" offset="3599130">Now, we submit that for the Brotherhood here to prevail, for the respondents here to prevail, they must on the basic issue in this case prevail on two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.085" offset="3655764">First, they must show that this case falls within the exceptions to the anti-injunction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.199" offset="3688155">That is Section 2283 of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.145" offset="3707904">Second, after bringing the case within those exceptions, they have to demonstrate that on the merits that this federal court, federal law defense that they attempt to litigate through this injunction against the state court proceedings, they further have to show that that defense is a good and valid defense.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="925.305" offset="3804557">And also we have to show with this injunction itself is not covered by Norris-LaGuardia?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis G. Lyons</label>
            <text syncTime="930.373" offset="3824828">Yes, and they further have to show that that is sort of a severable point, but they also have to demonstrate that the matter started by the injunction that our side sought in the federal court being denied for that various -– very reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.806" offset="3902568">We on the other hand need only to prevail on one of the three points, which we have just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.149" offset="3923989">We need only to demonstrate either that this case is not within any of the exceptions to Section 2283 or that the preemption or supersession defense that they're attempting to litigate in this fashion isn't a good one, or that Norris-LaGuardia here takes away the power of the federal court to enjoin.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis G. Lyons</label>
            <text syncTime="980.326" offset="4024717">Any one of those three reasons Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.990" offset="4039346">We start with Section 2283 of the Judicial Code, which is the statute that takes us back virtually to the start of our Constitutional Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.443" offset="4089187">In its earliest version, it was passed in 1793.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.251" offset="4108413">It has been amended at various times, but remains in the same substantial form in which it was enacted back then in the Third Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.407" offset="4157001">It now says, “A Court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by act of Congress or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.968" offset="4255222">” This Court has construed that statute on a number of occasions in the century and three quarters that it's been on books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.400" offset="4297017">The basic purpose of the statute, this Court has said, is to avoid needless friction between the state and the federal court systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.998" offset="4343411">The first reason obviously is comity that we have and have had since the foundation of our Constitutional Republic, two independent systems of Courts operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.264" offset="4396387">The relationship between them is a delicate matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.406" offset="4413001">The second reason is that of uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.765" offset="4426480">As this Court has once said, it is not only the state court judges that are capable of misinterpreting this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.230" offset="4468276">The lower federal courts, as this Court has indicated, sometimes are in error themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.012" offset="4507460">Recognizing that, this Court has indicated if we were to have the lower federal court sitting in judgment over whether the federal law defenses that were urged in the state courts were properly passed upon, we would have less and less uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.616" offset="4593873">We would have different federal judges taking different views, just as you would have different state court judges taking different views of what the federal law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.715" offset="4634206">We would be introducing added diversity and lack of uniformity rather than simplifying matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.016" offset="4667434">So it is that the 1793 legislation is in a way in the same -– deals with the same subject matter as the court's Judiciary Act of 1789, which again has been on the books and has been the basic principle of this Court's review of state court judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.355" offset="4752802">And that is that this Court has jurisdiction to review the validity of federal law defenses that are set up in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.781" offset="4810480">But then, only where the case had preceded in an orderly fashion through the state court system and where the judgment of the highest state court that is available to pass on the question has been obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.944" offset="4891146">Back in 1955, under the present version of the anti-injunction statute, Section 2283 --</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.444" offset="5569181">There was a –- an extensive evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction in the –- as many facts were developed then, I believe this could be developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.864" offset="5630830">In 1955, using as it was then in effect, the present version of Section 2283, in the Richman Brothers Case this Court made it plain that litigation of the so-called labor preemption or labor supersession, federal law defense to a state court proceeding was not an exception to Section 2283 simply because your position was that the state court was moving in an area where there was preemption or supersession because of federal labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.815" offset="5802611">That did not give you a right to go into federal court and obtain an injunction against the state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.919" offset="5843048">The Court there said that there was no additional implicit exception to be read into Section 2283 even where the contention by the party seeking the injunction was that the state court was wholly without jurisdiction over the subject matter having invaded a field preempted by Congress and let me say that this case I believe is not even as strong a case for a federal court injunction as was Richman Brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.032" offset="5987453">In Richman Brothers, we had a situation under the Taft-Hartly Act, the Labor Management Relations Act where this Court has held that the state courts are without jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.077" offset="6035728">Now, the principal substantive authority for their preemption or supersession defense that the respondents are urging here is this Court's decision in the Jacksonville Terminal case the last term where this Court expressly said that the state courts have jurisdiction, or that in the circumstances there presented that the application of their own state substantive law had there to yield because of preeminent federal policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.318" offset="6184626">Now, since there's no implicit exception for adjudication of the preemption or supersession defense, we turn to the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.037" offset="6235512">There are two exceptions in the statute that the respondents are citing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.315" offset="6268635">The first exception is for injunctions necessary in aid of the District Court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.021" offset="6311476">The revisers note in the existing precedence from the pre-1948 era, and this exception at least was designed to carry forward the pre-existing law, indicate that that exception deals with two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.254" offset="6388381">First, you have the removed case where case is removed from the state court to the federal court, and then the state court tries to go ahead with the case as if nothing had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.108" offset="6435819">And there, the authorities indicate that in order to protect its jurisdiction, in aid of the District Court's jurisdiction it may enjoin the proceedings in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.746" offset="6490363">The other has to do with fund or breaking the line, what the Courts call a reese, if there's a particular fund than only one Court could take jurisdiction over, the exception is also applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.687" offset="6554102">The decisions of this Court, Klein versus Burke Construction and Princess Lida v. Thompson back before the codification which this codification, we submit, carried forward, indicate that you may, despite that language, have parallel proceedings which seek general or personal relief in the two systems at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.796" offset="6666533">So here, there could be a federal court suit under federal law and the state court suit under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.203" offset="6700178">The fact that there is a proceeding in one doesn't affront the jurisdiction of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.830" offset="6726719">The next exception that they cite in which I think is the basis of the primary reliance by the respondents is the exception for injunctions necessary to protect or effectuate a District Court's judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.836" offset="6810728">Now, the revisers note teaches that that was aimed to prevent re-litigation by the state courts of a dispute which had been finally litigated by a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.479" offset="6877288">In effect, it was designed to overrule perhaps the high water decision of this Court's construction of the anti-injunction statute, which was the 2CV New York Life case back in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.750" offset="6938415">The respondents have tried then to characterize this case as one where the federal court was acting in enjoining these proceedings simply to protect or effectuate its judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.260" offset="7000377">Now, for the first time in this Court, they pointed to a whole litany of proceedings in the federal court the cases involving the government's suit against the FEC to which the carrier –- the other carriers aren't a party and the so-called Clark's Case, which came before this Court in 1966, which was a proceeding which was designed to see how far the FEC could go in changing the work rules with their own employees during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.411" offset="7157008">There is no order whatsoever or judgment whatsoever in any of these other proceedings that we are strangers to, which the respondent cite as being the order the district court was attempting to protect or effectuate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.455" offset="7233181">We come back to the order which is the one that they've relied on throughout, and that is the April 26, 1967 order of the federal district court, which was the order which denied the injunction to the ACL under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.944" offset="7327117">Now, that order says nothing whatsoever about the existence or non-existence of remedies in the state court under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.021" offset="7387408">Indeed, if getting the injunction in the state court affronted that order of the federal court, it took the respondents quite a long time to complain of that to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.298" offset="7456580">The state court order -– the federal court order was entered in April, 1967, the state court order in May, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.898" offset="7502973">Then two years passed and it was not until 1969 that the respondents suggested that there was something in the 1967 order of the federal court that the state court injunction contravened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.248" offset="7580400">I think the explanation for this delay is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.751" offset="7594402">What happened in 1969 was this Court's decision in the Jacksonville Terminal litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.504" offset="7629406">What we are trying -– what the respondents are trying to litigate in the federal court doesn't have anything to do really with the meaning of the district court's 1967 order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.166" offset="7684054">What they are trying to litigate is a preemption defense based upon the intervening decision in the Jacksonville Terminal Case, and that we submit puts us into the Richman Brothers situation where this Court has held that there will be no implicit exceptions to the anti-injunction statute to permit –- to permit litigants to try out the validity of preemption or supersession defenses against state law proceedings.</text>
