            <text syncTime="38.154" offset="255979">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.754" offset="270399">This case arises on a petition for writ of certiorari filed by the warden of the California State Prison from the decision rendered by the United States Courts of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.863" offset="330794">The court below held the jurisdiction existed in United States District Court for the Northern District of California to entertain a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed by a California prisoner serving a California sentence in California in order to challenge the constitutionality of an unrelated North Carolina conviction held that the California warden was an agent for the State of North Carolina and a proper party respondent to defend the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.204" offset="488155">It is respectfully submitted that the question raised in this case is essentially one and that is whether habeas corpus relief is presently available to a California prisoner in California who seeks to challenge the constitutionality of a sentence which has been imposed by another state.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="123.133" offset="595884">Mrs. Renne does the State of California have any option when another state places a detainer on a prisoner who is incarcerated in a California Institution?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louise_h_renne" startTime="136.107" stopTime="488.264">
            <label>Ms. Louise H. Renne</label>
            <text syncTime="136.107" offset="647816">It does Your Honor, under the Agreement on Detainer -- well, I have to answer this question in two ways, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.470" offset="681253">If another state is not a party to the Agreement on Detainers, then in order for that prisoner to stand trial in another state requires an executive agreement followed by extradition proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.757" offset="746350">Clearly in this case, the state has a reserve clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.617" offset="765889">Under the Agreement on Detainers, a prisoner -- if a prisoner invokes the agreement on the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.068" offset="803610">The State of California is required to send that prisoner back to the other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.412" offset="832972">If however that it is the other state that initiates proceedings, there is a reserve clause retained by the governor may or the prisoner may disapprove and not be willing to go to the other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.988" offset="899323">We believe Your Honor that the answer to the first question we have raised is clearly in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.551" offset="925550">If the Court should however decide that habeas corpus really is presently available, then there is another question which is raised by this case and that is, what is the appropriate forum in which to bring an action of this kind?</text>
            <text syncTime="222.409" offset="993050">The District of Confinement or the District of Sentencing, the facts of this case are that the petitioner below, John Edward George was in April of 1964 convicted upon his plea of guilty to first-degree robbery in the San Francisco Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.555" offset="1089599">He was sentenced to state prison and under the California Indeterminate Sentence Law that is indeterminate five years to life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.242" offset="1132335">Following his conviction, the petitioner was confined in San Quentin Prison and detainers were placed against him by three states.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.374" offset="1172877">The State of Kansas, the State of Nevada, and the State of North Carolina, at this time North Carolina and California were parties to the agreement on detainers which as I have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.907" offset="1230973">If a prisoner seeks to stand trial in another party state, he may invoke the procedures under the agreement and that is what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.110" offset="1275800">Accordingly in March of 1966, George was temporarily released from custody in California to stand in trial in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.902" offset="1323029">After one mistrial, George was convicted of robbery in February of 1967 in the North Carolina state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.325" offset="1364720">A sentence of 12 years to 15 years was imposed and as George alleged below, this sentence will not begin to run until he is in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.685" offset="1414144">George was returned to California in February of 1967 and in September of 1967 the North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.684" offset="1470151">In December of 1967 George filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in United States District Court for the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.324" offset="1516648">His first petition was captioned John Edward George versus the State of North Carolina and the district judge dismissed the petition or failure to name proper party respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.684" offset="1570147">Thereafter, George re-captioned his petition naming the warden of San Quentin Prison as an agent for the State of North Carolina and naming the warden of North Carolina State Prison name unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.556" offset="1629602">Ultimately, the District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed the petition on the basis of this Court’s decision in McNally v. Hill under which the Court had held that a prisoner must be confined under the sentence he is seeking to challenge in order to obtain habeas corpus relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.786" offset="1722493">Thereafter a certificate of probable cause to appeal was granted by the District Court but prior to the opening briefs being filed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.449" offset="1773171">This Court's decision in Peyton v. Rowe was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.573" offset="1789680">And in Peyton v. Rowe, this Court held that a Virginia prisoner could challenge the constitutionality of a consecutive sentence imposed by the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.509" offset="1845373">On the basis of Peyton v. Rowe, George filed a motion to remand the proceedings to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.353" offset="1884766">We were given notice of the motion and as our first appearance, filed in opposition to the motion to remand and move to dismiss the proceedings on the grounds that Peyton v. Rowe should not be extended to the interstate case that the California warden was not a proper party respondent in this habeas corpus action, that a North Carolina official who might be a proper party respondent was not before the court service of process had not been obtained and couldn't be obtained and that accordingly the District Court, the Northern District of California was without jurisdiction to proceed.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.918" offset="2375032">We do take the position that it is only after this Court decides which we strongly urge that it not do that there is custody within the meaning of the habeas corpus statute as only then that this court need reach the question of what is the appropriate forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1656.889" offset="6730898">I think having in mind the considerations which led this Court to its unanimous decision in Peyton v.

            <text syncTime="1692.085" offset="6871751">There is a difference obviously Peyton v. Rowe dealt with prisoner facing consecutive sentences imposed by one state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.726" offset="6902262">This involves two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.086" offset="6911666">I would say at the outset however that this distinction has been presented before Courts of Appeal and in that number I think some 16 judges and none of those 16 who considered the matter here before have considered that to be a meaningful distinction between Peyton and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.066" offset="6999646">Particularly with regard to Peyton's discussion and basis of the desirability and indeed perhaps the necessity of an early hearing on these claims, lest records, witnesses and evidence be washed by the passage of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1752.426" offset="7113122">The Court in which the petition for habeas corpus was filed was not the court where the person was confined which is a distinction is it not at some points?</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.277" offset="7172472">Perhaps you think, perhaps it seems type of technical but at least when I went to law school I always thought that in order for a court to have habeas corpus jurisdiction, a prisoner have to be confined somewhere within the jurisdiction of that court.</text>
