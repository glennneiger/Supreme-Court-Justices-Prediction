            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Today's calendar for argument is Number 387, California against John Anthony Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.682" offset="174059">Mr. James, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_e_james" startTime="18.652" stopTime="350.191">
            <label>Mr. William E. James</label>
            <text syncTime="18.652" offset="178030">Mr. Chief Justice -- thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.890" offset="186911">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.283" offset="196524">This matter is before this Court on the petition of the state of California containing that the Supreme Court of the state of California improperly and incorrectly interpreted the rulings of this Court on the question of the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment and that pursuant to that misinterpretation of the confrontation clause that the Supreme Court of California held unconstitutional a state statute that would have permitted the admission for the truth of the matters asserted prior inconsistent statements of a witness who was present at trial and subject to cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.995" offset="359320">It was only a few weeks back I believe that this Court had occasion to view another aspect of the confrontation clause and in Illinois versus Allen held there that a defendant could deprive himself of the right by his conduct to be present in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.615" offset="433821">The Court emphasized that one of the rights included in the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment was the right to be present in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.314" offset="472586">How else could you confront your accusers and this Court has been consistent in holding that the Sixth Amendment right is a right at trial, a right to conduct cross examination of the accusers, of the witnesses against the particular defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.408" offset="560985">In the early case -- I should say in the first case where this Court held that the confrontation clause was obligatory on that states Pointer versus Texas, this Court said as has been pointed out a major reason underlying the constitutional right of confrontation is to give a defendant charged with crime an opportunity to cross examine the witnesses against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.630" offset="673938">This Court followed that with the case of Barber versus Page emphasizing that the right to confrontation is basically a trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.319" offset="712600">It includes both the opportunity to cross examine and the occasion for the jury to weigh the demeanor of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.646" offset="753977">In a companion case to Pointer, Douglas versus Alabama, this Court used these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.531" offset="785533">Our cases construing the clause referring to the confrontation clause hold that a primary interest secured by it is a right of cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.720" offset="830255">An adequate opportunity for cross examination may satisfy the clause even in the absence of physical confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.937" offset="867140">In that particular case, a defendant Douglas had a co-defendant who was separately tried, Loyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.870" offset="902875">Loyd was convicted and took an appeal and at the trial of Douglas, the prosecution called Loyd and Loyd since he had an appeal pending decided to exercise his privilege against self incrimination and refused to answer questions so the prosecutor commenced to read his confession which implicated Douglas to him and the prosecutor asked the witness Loyd at each sentence if he had made this statement and he refused to answer on the ground of self incrimination and this Court held that the defendant Douglas had been denied the effective right of confrontation because he had no opportunity to cross examine the witness who was exercising the privilege against self-incrimination and in Bruton, a more recent case discussing the aspects of confrontation, this Court said in reference to the Douglas case, we held that Douglas' inability to cross examine Loyd denied Douglas the right of cross examination secured by the confrontation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.765" offset="1186461">We noted that effective confrontation of Loyd was possible only if Loyd affirmed the statement as his, however, Loyd did not do so but relied on his privilege to refuse to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.116" offset="1251871">Now, the California legislature in 1965 adopted the evidence code of California, incorporating in that code, the other provisions contained relating to evidence in the code of civil procedures and other codes and abandoned by the adoption of that code, the so-called orthodox view as to impeachment, the use of impeaching prior inconsistent statements and adopted what has been referred to as the academic view, that is that prior inconsistent statements of a witness, present in Court and subject to cross examination would be admissible as substance of evidence and they enacted evidence code Section 1235 which is the statute involved in this case and made it effective in California on January 1, 1967 and the factual basis upon which this case arises involved --</text>

            <text syncTime="412.359" offset="1752795">That this was in response to some sort of a felt need or was just as the academic rule and these commissioners were academic people and they thought they got to put on that rule, what was it?</text>

            <label>Mr. William E. James</label>
            <text syncTime="423.642" offset="1797935">Well, it was a conclusion of the commissioners that this was the federal rule of evidence and that there was no reason why these statements shouldn't be used as had been suggested by Wigmore in his latest work has been expressed by McCormick in his work on evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.509" offset="1881422">I think in our petitioner's opening brief at pages 36 and 37 where we are discussing the reasons by the advisory committee for the proposed rules of evidence for the federal courts and magistrates, they adopted a portion of the code commissioner's notes and has contained there, it generally states that Section 1235 admits inconsistent statements of witnesses because the dangers against which the hearsay rule is designed to protect are largely non-existent and it goes in continuance and it concludes by citing McCormick in his code and evidence and then the advisory committee of the federal rules, a committee for the adoption of the federal rules states that advisory committee finds this view more convincing than those expressed in People versus Johnson which was a predecessor of the Green case.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.600" offset="2125824">Moreover, the requirement that the statement be inconsistent with the testimony given assures a thorough explanation of both versions of the witnesses on the stand and bars, any general and indiscriminate use of previously prepared statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.051" offset="2183607">The commissioner's notes are contained in a number of volumes which preceded the action by the state legislature in adopting the evidence code.</text>

            <text syncTime="840.453" offset="3465174">The factual context where this case arises is the fact that a minor in early part of January of 1967 came into possession of a quantity of narcotics and marihuana and ultimately and on January 10th sold it to an undercover officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.003" offset="3563395">Further investigation including an arrangement for a meeting between the officer and the defendant Green resulted in Green's arrest and a preliminary hearing which was held on February 8, 1967, he was held to answer and information was filed and he was charged with violation of California Health and Safety Code Section 11532 furnishing to a minor a narcotic and he came trial on this charge on April 5th and April 6 of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.432" offset="3697142">At this trial, the people introduced the first witness, the minor himself, one Melvin Porter and he was placed on the stand and he was asked some questions and he related that in the early part of January, some time between the first and the 10th of January 1967, he'd received a telephone call from the defendant, the defendant told him that he had some stuff for him to sell but the witness, the minor witness testified that he couldn't remember what happened because he was under the influence of LSD and at that point, the people introduced pursuant to evidence code Section 1235, the portion of the direct examination of this particular witness in which he related that the conversation over the telephone with the defendant Green related to a sale, the selling by Porter of a kilo of marihuana and the testimony was -- preliminary testimony was that the marihuana came in 29 baggies in a large shopping bag and the witness at the trial, the minor witness who was asked if this was his recollection of what occurred and if that was the way he testified and if he believe he was telling the truth when he testified at the preliminary and he said yes, I believe it to be at that time, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.850" offset="4074768">He was then asked how he came into possession of this marihuana which portion of which he'd ultimately sold to this undercover police officer and he said that he couldn't recall who he got it from or where he found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.510" offset="4137462">And so again, the people pursuant to evidence code Section 1235 referred to this time, the cross examination of the minor witness at the preliminary hearing and when she acknowledged that the marihuana was pointed out to him by the defending Green who was apparently at the defendant Green's father's home and that after the defendant had pointed out to him the boy went and got it and thereafter consumed part of it, sold six or seven baggies including one sale to the undercover officer and the rest was supposedly was stolen from his closet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.530" offset="4317497">Now, he was asked at the trial concerning this statement that he had made, the testimony that he had given at the preliminary examination and he was asked this particular question, “alright, now with your recollection refreshed, would you tell us of your own knowledge where did you get that bag of marihuana?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.338" offset="4396701">And he said, “Well, I guess I got it from his backyard”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.601" offset="4413733">It was inquired who's backyard, he said “John”, referring to the defendant and the question by the prosecutor at the trial, “did you get any money for selling this marihuana, the bags that you managed to sell?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.231" offset="4468276">Answer, “Yes”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.993" offset="4475382">Question, “What did you do with the money?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.979" offset="4923329">Answer, “umm let's see”.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="1597.911" offset="6495065">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.085" offset="6499662">As Mr. James has said, there are two pieces of evidence involved here both prior inconsistent statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.529" offset="6549504">First, the testimony at the preliminary examination where I may point out, there was confrontation in the physical sense, that is the defendant was himself present and sought and saw the witness who testified and then the second piece of evidence is the statement made to officer Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.068" offset="6663607">Both Porter, the witness who testified at the preliminary examination and Wade, the officer to whom the statement was made were present at the trial and subject to cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.441" offset="6733093">The testimony at the preliminary investigation was of course an official record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.570" offset="6757648">I think I may point out too that in this particular case, the trial was before the court without a jury because the defendant had waived the jury but we do not believe that this should lead to any difference in the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.457" offset="6837164">There is a note by professor Kenneth Davis in the current April issue of the Harvard Law Review making a contention that the rule should be different in trials without a jury and in trials with a jury but I find hard to make that applicable in a criminal case because it seems to me odd that the defendant's counsel should be put to the choice of trying to decide whether we shall waive a jury or not depending upon what evidence can or cannot come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.714" offset="6978226">It seems to me that in a criminal case, the rules of evidence should be the same in either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.222" offset="7008214">Now, our submission here is against the decision below by the California Supreme Court which deals in effect only with the evidence taken at the preliminary examination and it is also against the decision of the California Supreme Court in California against Johnson decided a couple of years ago in which this Court denied the state's petition for certiorari which deals with a prior statement like that made to officer Wade here, unsworn and not subject to a cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.681" offset="7174144">We think that both decisions are wrong and that they are not required either by the constitution or by decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.323" offset="7212701">If we are wrong as to Johnson however, we would urge that the decision below with respect to the evidence at the preliminary examination is nevertheless wrong and should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.057" offset="7383646">-- but not to its admissibility and this leaves directly to the first point of my argument which is that this case is not a Sixth Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.540" offset="7433488">This case does not deal with the right of confrontation because the right of confrontation was fully vindicated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.978" offset="7471313">The witness Porter was present and sworn and subjected to cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.694" offset="7502137">The trier of the facts had full opportunity to see and hear him, to observe his demeanor and to form a conclusion about his honesty and trustworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.976" offset="7551248">That conclusion might well have been that he was a devious person who probably spoke the truth shortly after the event but for one reason or another found it convenient to be forgetful and evasive at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.936" offset="7615091">And similarly with respect to the other item, the witness Wade was present, sworn and subject to cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.770" offset="7654484">He testified fully and his personality and demeanor could be evaluated by the trier of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.720" offset="7690219">Thus, every objective and requirement of confrontation was met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.124" offset="7715819">This is not a case like Pointer against Texas or Douglas against Alabama or more recently Barber against Page, where the person whose out of court's statement was sought to be used was not present or available and particularly where the prosecutor was at fault in not having the declarant available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.779" offset="7822503">Here, the key fact is that the witnesses were present at the trial, were sworn and were subject to cross examination, so that the defendant had full opportunity to show what he could to the trier of the facts by way of impeachment, explanation, a contradiction or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.583" offset="7929710">Some 40 years ago, Judge Hand dealt with this problem in a case which is cited in our brief although this quotation is not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.990" offset="7971297">This is Decarlo against the United State in six federal second and I quote from Judge Hand, “he is present before the jury and they may gather the truth from his whole conduct and bearing, even if it be in respect of contradictory answers he may have made at other times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.845" offset="8062725">If from all that the juries see of the witness, they conclude that what he says now is not the truth but what he said before, they are none the less deciding from what they see in here of that person and in Court”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.449" offset="8149138">Indeed, this Court of course has held that prior statements maybe introduced even though the declarant is not present at the trial in cases of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.665" offset="8210056">Now, the leading case is Maddox against the United States in its two separate appearances in this Court where both dying declarations and testimony taken at a previous trial where the witness was now deceased were held admissible and the Maddox case was specifically referred to in the recent decisions of this Court as a decision which was not affected by those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.358" offset="8340773">There are other illustrations as in the case of book entries, ancient documents which might be used to prove title to land and a charge of trespass in a criminal case and other established exceptions to the hearsay rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.362" offset="8428857">In this situation where the witnesses were present and were cross examined in Court, it seems to me that the only case that is troublesome is Bridges against Wixon in 326 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.503" offset="8501373">Whatever maybe said about that case, it was a deportation case rather than a criminal case but I don't think that's of any particular importance, it is clearly distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.772" offset="8554454">There, the declarant took the stand as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.905" offset="8575039">He admitted that he made a statement as here, but at that point, the two situations diverge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.926" offset="8611088">In the Bridges' case, the witness denied at the trial that he had said anything in his statement about Bridges' communist activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.947" offset="8659153">Here, the witness admitted that he had made the statement and testified that he apparently thought that it was the truth when he made it, I don't want to overstate but he testified at the trial because he was very devious but he specifically admitted that he had made both of the statements and one of them of course was a public record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.714" offset="8850265">But as we see it, the Court need not reexamine Bridges now, it need say only that it is inapplicable in a case where as here, the declarant witness testifies under oath and subject to cross examination that he made the statement and that he believed it was true when he made it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.104" offset="8955800">There are of course a number of decisions of the Court that which support the conclusion that such evidence is admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.315" offset="8996655">There is the well known Bruton case involving the use of a co-defendant's confession in a joint trial implicating another defendant where the Court quoted from the leading Maddox case these words, hence, effective confrontation of Loyd, the witness who had made the statement was possible only if Loyd affirmed the statement as his and here the witness did affirm the statement as his.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.744" offset="9162376">And on the basis of this passage, this quotation of Maddox in the Bruton opinion, a number of lower courts have held that in the Bruton situation the confession of the co-defendant is admissible when he does in fact appear at the trial, is sworn and is subject to cross examination there and this Court has several times denied certiorari from such decisions and there's another case of this Court which seems relevant and interesting, its Stovall and Denno in 388 U.S and it is not cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.528" offset="9357458">That was the case which was decided on the same day as the Wade case involving minor, and in the Stovall Denno case, the only witness to the crime or a witness to the crime was the wife of the deceased who was seriously injured and was in the hospital and the defendant was taken to the bedside and the wife identified him then as the perpetrator of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.477" offset="9481279">It so developed that the wife recovered and she was a witness at the trial and was sworn and subject to cross examination and this Court held that the evidence of her prior identification was admissible, not merely her testimony at the trial but her inclusion in the trial of her prior identification without violation of the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.694" offset="9598098">Now I point that out because the Court held that since Wade was not retroactive, the confrontation clause was not before it but as I think this case is really a due process case and not a confrontation case, it does seem to me that Stovall and Denno is directly in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.980" offset="9671241">There, the prior statement, the prior evidence was consistent, not inconsistent but the same question would seem to me to be applicable in determining its admissibility and of course in that case as in the sequel to the Bruton case, the prior statement is not sworn and was not subject to a cross examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.301" offset="13176560">Exactly Mr. Justice, that's my point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.248" offset="13188368">Now, this question of the admissibility of prior inconsistent statements as evidence is one which has been discussed over a period of two generations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.933" offset="13239150">It is sometimes -- it seems to me denigrate a little bit by talking it about the orthodox rule and the academic view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.691" offset="13282095">The academic view for which we speak here has been supported by some very great figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.501" offset="13313337">We ignore who is one of our authentic greats and Morgan and Judge Weinstein can hardly be called impractical persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.751" offset="13358373">This change in the California statute Section 1235 was recommended by a state commission in California which had a staff of which professor James A. Chadman was the chief reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.953" offset="13435173">He is now at the Harvard Law School and is the editor carrying out the current revisions with more on evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.987" offset="13471326">This rule is supported by distinguished members of the bench not impractical men such as Judge Learned Hand whom I've already quoted and Judge Henry Friendly who is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.883" offset="13534856">From bantam to the present time, authorities have agreed that present hearsay law keeps reliable evidence from the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.862" offset="13574771">We should be continued to be free to experiment in this area by legislation, by delegated rule making and by judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.160" offset="13620015">The area should not be frozen into a constitutional rule by application of a constitutional provision which says nothing about it and obviously has no application to the problem either in terms or in light of its history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.292" offset="13688560">I speak of course of the Fourteenth Amendment because I earlier contented that the Sixth Amendment whether incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment of not has nothing to do with the case since the defendant here did confront both of the human witnesses involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.048" offset="13771525">There's no case in this Court which requires affirmance of the Court below either here or in its decision in the Johnson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.042" offset="13811545">On the contrary, affirmance here is nothing less than reading into the Fourteenth Amendment, a conclusion that hearsay evidence is always inadmissible for this evidence cannot come in, it is hard to see how any extra judicial statements can be received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.884" offset="13898898">That would be a revolution not only in the law of evidence but in constitutional law and if the Court thinks I am overstating, I can only say that's what the California Court has decided in both of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.478" offset="13957308">And moreover since we're talking about the Fourteenth Amendment and not the Sixth Mr. Chief Justice, I will borrow a little time form Mr. James with his permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.512" offset="14005373">I don't see how it could be limited to criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.120" offset="14023868">It would apparently apply to civil cases as well for they are surely subject to the Fourteenth and the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.047" offset="14055528">Apparently, such a rule would apply to the administrative process too where we widely had statute saying that the rules of evidence shall not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.730" offset="14094294">Such a conclusion would go beyond anything that is needed or useful or warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.992" offset="14119372">It would go far beyond any conception of due process which is part of our tradition or a concept of ordered liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.603" offset="14157824">Our law has always accepted hearsay evidence and evidence of extra-judicial statements and actions often without authorized cross examination under one or another of a great many exceptions to the hearsay rule and I would point out of course that other systems of law widely admits hearsay evidence subject only to the weight to be attributed to it and the scholars in those systems often find themselves quite unable to understand our concern about hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.298" offset="14300557">Often, in one situation or another and particularly in administrative proceedings of one kind or another, our law has specifically provided that no hearsay rule shall apply and that the only test of the admissibility of evidence shall be its relevance with its weight under all of the circumstances to be a matter for the trier of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.085" offset="14399718">It can hardly be said that such rules are irrational, it ought not to be said that they are forbidden by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.264" offset="14440469">If states wants to expand the admissibility of evidence within sound reason, they should be free to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.704" offset="14478190">As I've indicated, justice should be done in this case but not by distorting our rules of evidence and putting it beyond development and change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.462" offset="14529181">This is not a case for a constitutional decision and the California Court was wrong in thinking that this Court's decisions required it to dispose off the case on federal constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.913" offset="14591039">Now, that error should be corrected and the case should then be remanded to the California Court for further proceedings are not inconsistent with this Court's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3908.369" offset="15736874">And I think I can develop it for you through the facts and the situation that he was confronted with, how he was denied confrontation in the same senses if the witness had not even been on the stand or if he had been pleading self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.838" offset="15798732">Before, during and after the trial in this case, this 16-year old made four separate and self conflicting statements in regard to this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.536" offset="15845543">The first one was after Mr. Porter himself had been arrested and in an effect that was separate from the one we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.718" offset="15878248">He was arrested after selling marihuana to an undercover agent and he had been incarcerated for four days at the time he made this first statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.272" offset="15920462">The police officer, Officer Wade interrogated him at the juvenile headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.652" offset="15938017">Now only the two of them were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.933" offset="15947107">There was no lawyer either for the defendant Green or for the defendant Porter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.317" offset="15964662">No witness, no stenographer, just the two of them after this young boy had been in jail for four days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.576" offset="15989635">According to Wade, Porter told him that some weeks before, Mr. Green had called him and then he'd come by his house and brought with him a bag of marihuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.503" offset="16049403">The second statement was made at the preliminary hearing of Mr. Green after he had been arrested as a result of the first statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.936" offset="16083153">Mr. Porter was still in custody of the police, still in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.657" offset="16097991">His case had not yet been disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.562" offset="16113664">That hearing was held only eight days after Mr. Green's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.815" offset="16130591">And at the hearing, Porter testified this time, not that Green had brought a bag of marihuana to this house but rather that he had come and taken Mr. Porter over to the house of Mr. Green's father and it showed him some marihuana behind a bush and Mr. Porter had comeback on his own that night or the next day and picked it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.768" offset="16226408">Now I might say that there are number of inconsistencies between these first two statements and the state has never yet attempted to reconcile those inconsistencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="4134.216" offset="16640188">I think it goes to the point about what kind of witness is this and the necessity for having him give his convicting statement in front of the trier of fact and not back before some police officer or at some previous hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.256" offset="16692433">I want to emphasize that at the preliminary hearing, Officer Wade to whom the first statement had been given did not testify and no mention was made of that first statement and therefore Porter's attorney had apparently had no view of it, had no idea that he'd given a previous inconsistent statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4169.656" offset="16781981">Another thing about the preliminary hearing was that Porter's attorney apparently knew nothing about the LSD that was going to develop later because not a single solitary mention of LSD was made at that preliminary hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="4219.030" offset="16979466">When he's saying the words that convict this whole cross examination, the trial was not about the crime and a cross examination was -- well now, did you say something to somebody else back there and he is saying, I really don't -- I'm really not sure, I can't remember.</text>

            <text syncTime="4248.432" offset="17097122">This is the first time now that he is out of the hands of the police and what is he testified to now?</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.193" offset="17124185">He says “well, if you want to know the truth of it, I took LSD about 20 minutes before Mr. Green called me and I'm not sure what happened thereafter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.834" offset="17158666">He didn't know whether Mr. Green had come by his house, he didn't know whether if he came by the house, he left anything, he didn't know where he got the marihuana because he'd been under the influence of LSD.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.854" offset="17206836">It was less apparent to the state that they could not convict Mr. Green on the testimony in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.721" offset="17234213">This was the only testimony of this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.432" offset="17245080">So what do they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.668" offset="17254066">They turn around and have the officer come in and say, well, he told me down in juvenile headquarters, such and such and then they read to the witness from portions about 1/4th of the testimony at the preliminary hearing including I might say about 1/4th of the cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.378" offset="17332851">They read this testimony to the witness and they say, didn't you say that at the preliminary hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.566" offset="17357615">If you look on page 7 of my brief, you will see in the footnote his various replies to these questions about what he had said before if there was ever a young man who was confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.972" offset="17415293">Who seemed to be saying six different things at once, it was this young man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.638" offset="17429922">But the best we can make out of all this testimony was, well, if I said it before, perhaps it was true but the fact of the matter is that because of my condition, I don't know anything about the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.516" offset="17485406">Now because of these two sections of the California code, these prior two statements, the one to the officer and the one at the preliminary hearing where the young man, both arms was under police control, those were the statements that convicted Mr. Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="4364.858" offset="17562833">Nothing that was said at trial could have convicted him because the only direct evidence at trial was that he didn't know what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.947" offset="17603166">The fourth statement from this young man was made after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.975" offset="17631274">And it was in a sworn statement which he said he was making at the suggestion of his probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.518" offset="17657396">And here he said, he'd not gotten the marihuana from Mr. Green, he'd gotten it from the gentleman named plughead 7315 that Mr. Green was entirely innocent at the offense and that he, Mr. Porter had made these statements because of police threats when it was in their hands and because he was unable to distinguish between reality and fantasy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.981" offset="17747257">Now both the intermediate appellate court and the California Supreme Court unanimously held that Mr. Green was denied his right of confrontation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4607.077" offset="18531662">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.656" offset="18554023">There are three basic ingredients of the right of cross confrontation which I would like to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.276" offset="18584430">All three of which were missing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.675" offset="18598118">The first one is perhaps the least important of the three but nevertheless I think it's a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.493" offset="18621315">It's the requirement that the witness make the incriminating statement at the crucial hearing itself so that the subjective moral impact of the courtroom is brought to bear on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.170" offset="18672097">So that he fully realizes the importance, a seriousness, the gravity of the proceeding and the necessity for telling the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.889" offset="18710967">I'm not going to elaborate this except to say that it's a very far crime from giving the statement to a police officer and juvenile headquarters than it is from giving it under oath before a judge or a jury facing the defendant in the courtroom itself where the issue of innocence or guilt is going to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.480" offset="18793305">The second basic ingredient is viewing the contemporaneous demeanor of that witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.861" offset="18818800">The concept that the witness will make his incriminating statements in front of the trier of fact so that the trier of fact then and there as the words are said can determine whether this man is telling the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.445" offset="18881181">Now the state says that you can judge his demeanor at trial as he's asked about his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.888" offset="18910960">But is the demeanor at trial in any way comparable to the demeanor on the prior occasion, of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.631" offset="18945860">Porter in the hands of the police implicates Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.149" offset="18968012">Porter out of the hands of the police fails to implicate green.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.621" offset="18989850">We can see his non-implicating demeanor at trial but his implicating demeanor is lost to as forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.418" offset="19029034">There's no way we can go back and pick that up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.564" offset="19041677">The state's position assumes that you can judge at trial whether or not the witness is lying at trial and therefore you can make an assumption about prior truth but that's just as himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.870" offset="19110849">In this case, if the judge at trial found that porter was telling the truth about taking LSD, it follows of course that Green's conviction cannot stand because Porter said that the effect of the LSD was such that he simply did not know the facts about the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.124" offset="19175842">But what if the judge at the trial didn't believe the story about LSD?</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.796" offset="19202591">What can that possibly prove about the two prior statements?</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.441" offset="19225161">Porter could have lied in his first statement, he could have lied in his second statement, he could or he could have lied a trial or all three occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.214" offset="19264240">It's not enough to see the man's demeanor now, weeks or months after those statements were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.321" offset="19288691">You got to be able to compare demeanors to see the demeanor now and the demeanor then.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.177" offset="19312097">As a matter of fact, there's a very great danger here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.853" offset="19326830">Because I think that there is a tendency to feel when a man is lying at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.132" offset="19351907">If he has made a prior statement that is different to feel automatically that the other statement must be true.</text>

            <text syncTime="4851.952" offset="19511150">If he was here at trial, he would tell the same story that he told before.</text>

            <text syncTime="4858.539" offset="19537481">Here, that's completely refuted and rebutted because when the man gets on the stand at the trial and you're looking him in the eye, he has a different story to tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.742" offset="19578337">The other thing about the dying-declaration is that it has a very high degree of probability of truthfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.814" offset="19606653">The Courts have always assumed perhaps rightly or wrongly, that a man on his death bed is going to tend to tell the truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="6965.510" offset="27965419">Under the California statute, they couldn't care less about a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6969.624" offset="27981824">They've got their case, they've got the statement before Officer Wade at the preliminary hearing and they know they can go in and convict on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6978.012" offset="28015470">And I say that the answer to the turn code witness is not to take away the most valuable single right the defendant has in a criminal trial and that is to confront and cross examine the witnesses against him as the crucial incriminating testimony comes in.</text>

            <text syncTime="7013.474" offset="28157262">I think there is no fact clearer from the decisions of this Court than that the right of confrontation is a trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="7022.674" offset="28194043">And if there is anything in our adversary system, it is the right of cross examination by competent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="7031.629" offset="28229883">I believe Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out that if there are discrepancies in the story of a witness, a prior statement, a statement in the Court, competent counsel can probe out that statement and determine and the -- what the truth is and the trier of fact is an opportunity to view the witness as he is testifying on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="7053.423" offset="28317027">Now this argument that we've heard about contemporaneous utterances, it comes I think from the Supreme Court of California where they use the term contemporaneous confrontation which isn't found in the Sixth Amendment as far as I know and it sort of a do it yourself constitutional attitude if there is to be any confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7078.885" offset="28418905">The personal confrontation if at trial should be sufficient where the competent counsel has an opportunity to examine the witness to find out why he made a statement at one time.</text>
