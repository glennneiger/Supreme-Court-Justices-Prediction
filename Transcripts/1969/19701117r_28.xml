            <text syncTime="45.040" offset="180140">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.202" offset="196754">The appellants in this case, Your Honors, presented to the Court over a year ago what we thought was a narrow question of due process involving the right to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.748" offset="242939">When we presented the case to you last time, we argued on the basis of the Snyder case that the deprivation of the property-- of the rental property of our clients was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.206" offset="292780">Since the Snyder case and since we last made that argument, this Court has given further encouragement to our clients and to us on the same issue with the case of Goldberg v. Kelly which is, again, a hearing case involving due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.501" offset="365923">Our position is very simple that, really, we don’t ask the Court to go any further than the Court went in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.617" offset="394449">Indeed, we take the position that the case before you is much easier to deal with than the cases you dealt with-- than the two cases you dealt with there.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="108.149" offset="432588">Mr. Padnos, I hesitate to bring the question up, but I think there is a question of mootness in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.520" offset="469995">Certainly, the suggestion of mootness is filed in this case prior to argument and my recollection is that the Court deferred consideration of that motion to the argument of the merits, and I would expect that you’ll be dealing with that, will you, before the end of your argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="132.246" offset="528927">I’ll be happy to begin with that, sir.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael D. Padnos</label>
            <text syncTime="136.670" offset="546586">The appellees have suggested to you that there’s a possibility of mootness and they’ve raised two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.336" offset="565290">First of all, they point out that they believe that our clients may have moved out and, indeed, they are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.450" offset="585770">Our clients have moved out.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.771" offset="590994">And, secondly, they present the existence of a new statute enacted in Georgia earlier this year. As we indicated in our sup-- in our response to the question, there-- I think there are several reasons why this case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.801" offset="651180">First of all, the fact is that, as to our clients, the specific clients in this case, Mrs. Sank and Mrs. Momman, even though they’ve moved out they’re still subject to the double rent provisions of 61305.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.506" offset="701962">So, there is no way that this Court-- if this Court should hold this case moot, we would not be within the Brockington case and Hall v. Beals that this case-- this Court decided last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.325" offset="753267">In one of those cases, the Court said that it was impossible to grant the relief that the plaintiff sought that was in Brockington, I believe, where there was a question of a man running for Congress and, in the other case, Hall v. Beals, the Court just talked about the 1968 election and said, “That’s history.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.785" offset="811050">It’s all over.”</text>
            <text syncTime="203.777" offset="815020">Well, it isn’t history what’s happening to Mrs. Sanks.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.429" offset="825678">Mrs. Sanks, as a matter as the same proceeding which is before you right now, will be held, if the landlord does no more than walk into Court in the same judicial proceeding and ask for double damages, will be held liable for double damages for the total amount of rent that he claims to be due.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.127" offset="892447">So, Mrs. Sanks--</text>

            <text syncTime="302.548" offset="1210096">So, we went as far as the procedures that that Court would permit us to go and we couldn’t file the bond, and that’s why we couldn’t go further in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.343" offset="1625339">The dispossessory warrant that we’re dealing with was taken out prior to July 1, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.617" offset="1642371">It was under the old Act, and our contention is that although there is now a new Act, and I’m happy to admit to the Court, as is perfectly obvious, that there are not as many people going to be affected by the Act for which we’re talking about today than would be affected by the new Act, but-- and so, we’re talking about a relatively small group of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.406" offset="1717603">But, we are here today under the old Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.486" offset="1725858">Now, it is-- I certainly submit to the Court and I think I’m being-- I’m accurate in it, it is perfectly clear that our clients and potentially other clients, indeed the clients in the two cases that are now pending before the Federal District Court and the Northern District of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.314" offset="1785208">At least those two groups of people are potentially subject to double damages and, in this piece of litigation, I think that’s important.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.871" offset="1815406">Indeed, in looking over the argument last time, I found that I may really have misled the Court because I suggested that a second lawsuit might have to be filed in order to collect these damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.494" offset="1857933">I’ve done a little more research and I now can assure you that that isn’t true.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.358" offset="1873398">All that needs to be done is if you should hold this Court-- this case moot, for example, or if you should decide for the appellee, all that needs to happen in this case is the landlord in both of these cases goes into Court and says “I now want a judgment amounting to double the amount of rent that has been paid during the period of this litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="828.703" offset="3314730">There seem to be three reasons why we still are in Court, unless there’s no saving statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.082" offset="3336255">One is that those ladies are subject to double damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.507" offset="3349943">The second is the question of the whole statutory scheme involved in here, both 303 and 305.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.296" offset="3377110">Even if there’s a problem with 303 and I think in being honest with the Court, I must say that there is a problem about mootness in this case about 303.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.164" offset="3416607">That is the posting of the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.575" offset="3422250">That’s the provision that relates to the posting of the bond, and there’s no way that I can figure out that 303 has any direct consequences on our clients and I think there’s a serious problem with mootness, narrowly seen in this case on 303.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.402" offset="3489541">The final point I think should be made on mootness is this Court’s often expressed view that when there’s a case that is capable of repetition yet evading review, mootness should not be read narrowly but should be read in a larger sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.670" offset="3546593">And, I think in this case that would be the problem because of the many other cases you have that will deal with the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.408" offset="3569580">Indeed, there’s another case in Oregon that’s going to come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.089" offset="3580343">As you may know, there’s a main, I believe we quoted in our brief, a main case on a very similar issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.066" offset="3604167">This really is a case that the Court, I suspect, will be asked to deal with on a number of other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.784" offset="3631125">I’m just-- unless the Court has any further question, I’ll close on mootness right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.798" offset="3659128">I see the Court is very troubled by this and by tomorrow, when we finish this argument, I certainly will have an answer for you about the saving statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.372" offset="3697476">With the Court’s permission, I’ll just take a few minutes and talk about the substantive issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.806" offset="3727151">We, in our brief, talked a lot about equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.147" offset="3740526">One of the good things about the fact of coming to the Supreme Court is you have a long time to think about your cases and chew them up for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.874" offset="3775425">The more I think about the equal protection argument, the less excited I am by it, and the more I think about the due process argument, the more excited I am by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.115" offset="3816385">I come here today not asking you to decide this case on equal protection grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.453" offset="3837806">I think, in many dissents before this Court and in many majority opinions of this Court, misgivings have been expressed about equal protection which suggest that equal protection is the doctrine that ought to be carefully dealt with, I think, and I don’t think we need to ask the Court to go as far as equal protection with its notions of compelling state interest and its notions of more complicated adjudication of constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.517" offset="3950028">We’re talking about a very narrow little question, and that is the right to get into Court and where, it seems to me, we’re right within Snyder and we’re right within Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.776" offset="3999033">Let me finish today’s presentation by suggesting just two ways in which I think we’re even a narrow-- we present a narrower question to you than was presented in Snyder and Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.404" offset="4045531">In the Snyder case, for example, there’s no finding of indigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.526" offset="4058070">Indeed, there’s a specific question raised as to whether Mrs. Snyder is indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.390" offset="4073535">We’re indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.545" offset="4078132">It’s clear in the record that we have a finding of indigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.440" offset="4093701">So, you’re dealing with more-- an easier problem from that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.550" offset="4118152">Finally-- And, secondly, in both Snyder and Goldberg, the deprivation that’s talked about is only a temporary deprivation of the use of property and that was pointed out in, I believe, a dissent in that case very clearly that the use of the property is what was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.728" offset="4186906">In our case, once they’re out, they’re out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.762" offset="4194952">That’s it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.518" offset="4197982">That’s a final deprivation of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.596" offset="4210312">In that case too-- our case is-- for that reason--</text>
