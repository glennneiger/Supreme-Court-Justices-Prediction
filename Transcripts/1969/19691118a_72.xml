            <text syncTime="42.798" offset="274578">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.367" offset="312822">On July 24, 1966, in the city of Birmingham, Alabama on a dimly lit highway in Jefferson County of Alabama, several black individuals attacked a white man and his wife on the side of the road, while they were fixing a flat on their car.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.583" offset="457749">These black individuals fired a pistol twice into the body of the gentleman fixing the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.381" offset="532877">A passing car coerced the individuals to flee from the scene and on September 29, 1969, approximately 1966 -- I beg your pardon approximately 2 months later, they were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.747" offset="630366">They were interrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.278" offset="640502">They were placed in a line up.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.896" offset="650951">They were taken before a magistrate for a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.475" offset="673311">They were arraigned, they were tried, they were convicted just this case has sort his way to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.102" offset="711764">The question is whether or not the preliminary hearing is a critical stage in the proceedings of a criminal case, requiring the presence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.590" offset="769755">However, the real case here, real issue here if with regard to a poor man being a defendant in a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.119" offset="819806">The Sixth Amendment says, “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="192.852" offset="874768">And I suggest to you there weren't not for the fact that these defendants are poor, they would not be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.179" offset="904129">The Court has interpreted the Sixth Amendment to mean that counsel is needed at the accusatory stage, at the interrogation, at the lineup, at the arraignment, at the trial, at the appeal, at the probation hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.445" offset="953135">But it has excused and ignored the preliminary hearing, which is probably the most single, most important phase of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.597" offset="1001723">In my county, these defendants could be tried at the county courthouse without a lawyer at the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.087" offset="1051669">They could walk three blocks down the street and have a lawyer at the preliminary hearing at the federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.304" offset="1544547">It's understandable however that the Hamilton case is confusing, because of the preliminary -- being called a preliminary hearing and really is not, it's an arraignment, where plea is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.369" offset="1584880">Our statute is very similar to the statute in the case of Pointer versus -- in Texas, in the case of Pointer versus Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.484" offset="1649351">However, the Court said and I quote from their opinion, “Whether there might be other circumstances making a preliminary hearing, so critical as a defendant, as to call for an appointment of counsel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="396.702" offset="1690206">At that stage we need not decide on this record and that question we reserve.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.236" offset="1816325">One, it is the first opportunity that the defendant has to be adequately informed by an allegedly impartial person of that which he is charged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.912" offset="7371003">And I would like to call the Court's attention to that, if the defendants will not represent by the -- by counsel at preliminary, any statements made by them, so would be inadmissible at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.329" offset="7412694">Now that's -- appendix page 50 and 69, and record page 74 that was determined three times in the motion to suppress evidence and Mr. Tarter ask those matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.214" offset="7564204">Well, that was one of the contentions, so that as Mr. Tarter pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.857" offset="7586774">But, what I'm saying is that the testimony at the preliminary is only used occasionally to impeach a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.417" offset="7621047">So, that actually really don't operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.177" offset="7632123">Now, I would like to point out that that is would not be in conflict with the Barber versus Page which Mr. Justice Marshall in that particular case, I think they reach some evidence from a preliminary into the main trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.657" offset="7718013">I would like to call the Court's attention to pages 7 and 8 of my brief in which I actually quoted the Court of Appeals there, because it's well worded, the purpose of the preliminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.707" offset="7782170">I couldn't say it better, I think that covers it, to tell whether an offense has been committed and whether to hold a release the accused and the time of bail in the appropriate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.587" offset="7829713">Those are the purposes of the preliminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.594" offset="7865762">I would like now if the Court had no further questions to go on this matter of line of this case the Court subsequent to the ruling in Stovall versus Denno, which declare that any confrontations after I believe June 12, 1967 as that Wade versus -- wade and Gilbert decision were not applicable as far as requiring an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.414" offset="7997001">This happened prior to Wade or Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.567" offset="8017690">Therefore, this would come up before the Court on the question of whether when at this pretrial lineup, when the defendant did not have counsel, whether based on the totality of the circumstances, the confrontation was such that so suggestive as to a course of misidentification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.492" offset="8133360">Now, this gets on the matter of totality of circumstances, which to my way of thinking is just does the evidence supported?</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.975" offset="8179231">Now reading the case over, the transcript -- I noticed that the first 123 pages and I think the appendix have sites those pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.990" offset="8287378">Now, that dealt with a motion to suppress any state once made by the defendants or any statements that the detectives who interrogate defendants would testify to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.090" offset="8339728">As well as any identification by case, Casey Frank Reynolds, the prosecuting witness in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.050" offset="8379538">Now, the state confess the motion as to any confessions or statements made to the detective and any statements made by the defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.161" offset="8452054">There were two defendants trying to join in the incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.530" offset="8465533">They confessed these motions, so the only thing that the Court overruled was the part about permitting Mr. Reynolds to testify as to identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.443" offset="8525093">Now the -- that brings us really to the merits of the case, which is from record page 123 through 240 in the large record, which I understand the Court in addition to the little appendix we looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.666" offset="8606072">Briefly, this case was one in which a man and his wife had been to Coleman, Alabama on a Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.284" offset="8644524">I believe it was July 24, 1966, they were returning to their home in Bluff Park which is a suburb in Birmingham, they had a flat tire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.678" offset="8686111">The man got out to change the flat, while he was crashed over changing the tire, three men came cross, fired a shot, the first hit him in the neck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.596" offset="8737729">And then, one grabbed his wife and he said that he was about three feet away from the man who grabbed his wife and he saw his face clearly, that was John Henry Coleman, he identified him at the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.045" offset="8827591">I don't know really many ways to show the lineup was properly, except these ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.378" offset="8856848">I want to show that the identification, in Court identification was based on something other than viewing the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.230" offset="8904286">Therefore, if the Court will indulge from a minute, I'll go into this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.251" offset="8920377">Now, he stated that about this time, another car came by the lights flashed, and these three men ramped across the road and as one, was about ten feet away from him, facing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.996" offset="8979310">He took a pistol and shot him, he said, “I recognize that man who shot me as Ode Stevens and that I saw his face,” and that's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.811" offset="9030614">Now, Mr. Casey Frank Stevens was in the hospital for about eight or nine days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.094" offset="9055796">They took him to a hospital and forcing his life safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.674" offset="9078053">Now, in September, I believe the 29th, the police brought in several suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.829" offset="9110653">They called Mr. Reynolds to come and look at the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.949" offset="9147120">There is a little discussion about whether they told him that these were or some of the people who shot him or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.998" offset="9175333">He said that he doesn't recall telling him that, but he assumed that that was on the purpose the least would have to call him if he had done nothing, no violation of the law in his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.038" offset="9223502">So, he went down there, they brought these men in the lineup, and I understand the lineup in the Birmingham area, there's a stand about four feet high and the man used the people come by.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.118" offset="9287868">He was there, by himself and incidentally there were no other prosecuting witnesses there to compare notes as to this one, as the one or what not, the case of Frank Reynolds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.898" offset="9326947">Well, the first man he saw, he said, “That's the man who shot me,” identified Ode Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.594" offset="9373759">Then they had the other ones lined up, there were six of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.514" offset="9393403">From this lineup, he picked two of the men who had been in the assault, with intent to murder at the night of July the 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.749" offset="9438333">Now, I would like to call the Court's attention to appendix page 88 and 89.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.009" offset="9479398">There were six men in this lineup, Ode Stevens, if you will notice was 6'2”, weighed a 173 lbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.376" offset="9540838">They had three men of approximately the six feet arrived in the same weight and size.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.479" offset="9573334">Now, Coleman on the other hand, was a short man, five foot four and half inches tall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.939" offset="9607084">They had three man of his approximate size, one was five foot seven, one was five eight, and goes Coleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.259" offset="9660374">This -- a reason I point that out gentlemen so many cases are reversed, because you might have something like this, the prosecuting witness would say, well he was a bald headed man, so they bring in three or four people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.934" offset="9731114">One is bald headed, and the other three have a lot of hair, well he says well that's the one who did it, but what I'm pointing out here is these were the same size and types of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.085" offset="9775731">Now, there is only one possible flow, and I don't think that's a flaw in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.565" offset="9801644">Coleman, one of the defendants had on a hat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.679" offset="9826095">Now, there was no testimony at the trial on the motion to suppress as to the fact who caused him to wear this hat, did the police require him to?</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.159" offset="9888057">He wore a hat at the time of the assault, somewhere in the -- we have just to apply common sense, what was his hat is up to and did he wear a hat all the time?</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.922" offset="9939048">Now, or did somebody require to put it on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.348" offset="9952737">Now, he testified on the motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.666" offset="9970082">He testified again on the -- its principle trial I believe -- no where in there did he say, “They forced me to put on a hat.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.684" offset="10018147">He had able counsel at this trial 4121, they didn't bring it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.958" offset="10051166">So, it might be assumed that he wore a hat.</text>

            <text syncTime="2682.014" offset="10831391">Now, he does say in the record, he said, “They made me say certain words.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2691.116" offset="10867858">They made Ode Stevens say certain words, and they made Hudges say certain words, none of the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.933" offset="10899101">Now, that is a variance with the testimony of Mr. Reynolds prosecuting witness, he said that he wanted them to say something and the police would not let in and those people say a word, the people in the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.248" offset="10980394">So, he couldn't identify by the words getting into the woods or anything of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.335" offset="11000665">Now, I believe Lieutenant Hart, a detective said that he thought all six of them did, but and then I believe another one detective stated that yes, they said that it was after Mr. Reynolds have made the identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.158" offset="11144025">Now, we feel that this lineup was fair, that this prosecuting witness made the identification. He saw the people who had shot him, who were involved in that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.998" offset="11215391">Now, when he came to trial, we appoint this out that he made his identification, he said, “Those are the men, Stevens is the man that shot me that night, and Coleman is the man that was three feet away from me and grab my wife, I saw both of their faces.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.503" offset="11281429">So, what I'm pointing out is that the -- in Court identification was not made from what he had seen at the lineup, but rather what he had seen at the time the assault was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.030" offset="11343496">I feel that on the -- circumstances, that is the real, meaning coconut so to speak is whether or not the identification was based on either some pictures or somebody he saw in the lineup and then he comes into Court and makes an in Court identification of whether it was something separate and apart from the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.545" offset="11437537">We maintain here with something separate the border line.</text>
