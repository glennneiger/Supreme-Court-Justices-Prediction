            <label>Mr. David A. Diamond</label>
            <text syncTime="33.557" offset="237589">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.675" offset="246053">This case concerns the application of the privilege against self-incrimination as developed in the Marchetti, Grosso and Haynes and most recently, the Leary case, to the situation of a transferor of marihuana pursuant to the transfer, order form requirements of the Marihuana Tax Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.268" offset="340407">Briefly, the facts of this case are that the petitioner was introduced by a friend to two federal narcotics agents acting in an under cover capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.170" offset="388054">He had no -- they had no knowledge of his existence prior to the introduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.274" offset="404459">They were introduced to him simply as Mike, the petitioner's first name.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.457" offset="425148">As a result of the introduction there were various sales of marihuana and marihuana drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.916" offset="451062">The sales were made not in pursuance of an order form issued by the treasurer of the United States as required by 26 U.S.C. Section 4742.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.091" offset="499754">Petitioner did not request an order form from the agents, the agents had not procured such an order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.278" offset="532459">Petitioner was indicted on three counts, two of which were selling, not in pursuance of an order form and was convicted on one count, not selling pursuant to an order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.861" offset="582823">The case was affirmed by the Second Circuit relying solely on United States against Minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.146" offset="608005">The Second Circuit held that the marihuana statute, the marihuana tax statute was for practical purposes, the same as the Narcotic Drug Act involved in Minor that there was no risk of self-incrimination to a transferor and that the transferor of marihuana was not a person inherently suspect of criminal activities and that the profession of transferring marihuana or being involved in marihuana transactions was not an inherently suspect and illegitimate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.277" offset="728482">This was not a statute designed to close down a criminal activity but rather to regulate a legitimate activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.434" offset="753142">Briefly, the Marihuana Tax Act statutory scheme consists of an occupational tax provision, series of provisions requiring any transferor of marihuana, anyone who deals in marihuana which is defined as to very broadly and includes selling it or giving away, to register as a dealer, to pay an occupational tax and to keep records his transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.991" offset="863378">There is also a transfer tax provision which requires a transferee, a purchaser or acquirer of marihuana to obtain an order from the treasurer of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.351" offset="916773">He must in it pay in advance the tax on the material to be acquired, the tax is either at the rate of $1.00 an ounce or $100.00 an ounce depending upon whether the transferee is himself registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.065" offset="971630">He pays the tax based upon the amount he intends to acquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.438" offset="985109">In order for him to acquire that order form, he must place on file with the government prior to obtaining the form and prior to consummating the transaction, his own name and address and the name and address of his proposed transferor as well as the amount of the drug he proposes to transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.414" offset="1061073">There are numerous exemptions from the order form requirement and as the Court noted in Leary, they are essentially all of the legitimate transactions that are involved in marihuana, transverse by Doctors to patients by pharmacist to costumers pursuant to Doctor's orders, by officials of the government, transactions for export, so that there is left subject to the order form requirement a residual class of essentially of illegal transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.642" offset="1189909">The information obtained by the order form, he is given copies of the order form are made available to any state or local official who is concerned officially with the enforcement of local narcotics laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.614" offset="1241840">The mere possession of marihuana is illegal in every state of the union with certain very limited exceptions corresponding largely to the exemptions of the order form requirements under Section 4742.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.950" offset="1343195">The marihuana statutes differ radically from the narcotic statutes in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.738" offset="1362317">Any person desiring to acquire an order form may acquire it if he is a so called legitimate purchaser, one who is registered under the occupational tax sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.066" offset="1411636">He pays $1.00 per ounce.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.059" offset="1419577">If he is an illegitimate purchaser, one who is not registered, he pays $100.00 an ounce, but any person off the street who wants to acquire marihuana for smoking or any other purpose may acquire an order form.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.037" offset="1475480">And pay $100.00 an ounce, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.990" offset="1491362">The Leary case, Leary case involve such a -- such a purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.018" offset="1515395">The Leary case held that the marihuana statute, the transfer of provisions as applied to an unregistered transferee, who was Leary, applied to a person inherently suspect of criminal activities and existed in an area permeated with criminal statutes particularly by virtue of the exposure of the information contained on the order form to the state authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.704" offset="1610167">It held therefore that the privilege against self-incrimination applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.393" offset="1624900">The Court in Leary also refused to severe the statute so as to make the order form provision applicable but withdraw the information from the perusal of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.500" offset="1669413">It also applied the privilege against self-incrimination to prospective act since in the Leary case, the purchaser acquired the order form prior to time that any paying transaction was consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.967" offset="1723225">The petitioner here contends that the Leary reasoning applies fully to his -- to the position of a transferor of marihuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.722" offset="1758229">Under the same order form procedure, the acts required of the transferor in order to comply with the provisions of 4742 yield an even greater danger than they did to the transferee of marihuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.038" offset="1815489">I review briefly the acts which we consider to constitute the self-incrimination aspects of this thing in terms of the transferor.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.686" offset="1854151">There are four acts, some or all of which maybe present with respect to any particular transaction in relation to marihuana on the part of the transferor.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.492" offset="1901380">The act in effect, the act -- I may note again that the name and address of the transferor must be on file with the government prior to the consummation of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.912" offset="1951013">The mechanism provided by the statute is the use of the transferee.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.016" offset="1971388">The transferee must procure the order form and give the information directly to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.187" offset="1996152">We maintain however that the statutory scheme envisions the transferee as a conduit for the transfer of the required information to the government, which information demands acts on the part of the transferor incriminating to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.043" offset="2071594">He must, knowing that the information is to go to the government and that it is incriminating to him provide information.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.163" offset="2648064">The seller and the buyers were strangers, they were introduced by a third party solely on the basis of first names, that is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.633" offset="2673873">However, once the transferee has obtained an order form, the transferor must accept that order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.239" offset="2708355">We contend that the act of acceptance is an acknowledgement and an adaptation of the information contained on the order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.211" offset="2744195">The informa -- the order form is an inherently incriminating device when it contains the information that the transferor has sold certain drugs illegally to a transferee, when the transferor accepts that piece of paper, even when, if he were to refuse to accept it, if he were to ask about its existence, if he were to learn of the existence of this piece of paper and then transfer drugs pursuant to it, he would be adopting the information on that paper as his own as being true and valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.361" offset="2880867">The statute requires him to participate to a great extent in the incriminatory act involved in the order form process.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.294" offset="2920573">It is -- in our mind, it is the same thing as signing a confession that someone else has typed.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.741" offset="2946382">The information may already be in the possession of someone else but when you take it as your own, you are acknowledging it as true, when it is possible although for practical reasons very unlikely that a transferee might obtain an order form without ever speaking to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.988" offset="3019316">Obviously, at that point, nothing has been done by the transferor to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.707" offset="3038229">When he accepts the piece of paper, he has enabled the transferee to say when asked, I gave this piece of paper to the buyer and he accepted it assuming that the buyer would tell the truth, we cannot postulate that the statute will be maintained on the basis of the seller's purgery, assuming that the seller would tell that truth when asked, he would be required to say that he accepted this piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.172" offset="3140106">In addition, he is required by the statute to retain the piece of paper which constitutes an additional piece of evidence of his criminal act for two years and to make it available to all law enforcement officials who might come to ask for it in that two years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.895" offset="6610944">The petitioner contends that Section 4742 (a) which simply requires that he receive from his transferee an order form which to the transferee shall have obtained, in some way compels him to make incriminating disclosures to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.874" offset="6682833">We believe that his contention seeks to establish much more than the words of the statute where its operation in fact can support.</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.190" offset="6804146">The transferor is neither required nor entitled to apply for an order form from the district director.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.122" offset="6839881">The only duty which this statute imposes on the petitioner is to transfer marihuana only to those persons who have made their acquisition lawful by paying the tax and acquire and receiving an order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.994" offset="6899336">The statute punishes not a failure to disclose information but a transfer, a transfer to someone who does not demonstrate that he has complied with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.911" offset="6943013">It is our position that the statute on its face and in practice can be complied with without the transferors disclosing any information at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.507" offset="6997452">Petitioner's argument to the contrary is found in what he asserts to be the practical consequences of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.832" offset="7026709">He knows that the transferee must provide the name and address of the transferor in his application for an order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.065" offset="7059623">He then assumes that the transferee can obtain that information only from the transferor himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.249" offset="7088358">This assumption is essential to the success of petitioners argument for it provides the aspect of self-incrimination which is lacking on the face of the statute, unless it can be said that the transferee necessarily must obtain that information from the transferor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.003" offset="7159411">It cannot be said that compliance with the statute infringes the transferor's right to refrain from making incriminating disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.545" offset="7197550">The petitioner offers no support for this assumption in which his argument rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.118" offset="7215835">If he is relying on common experience to justify the assumption, such experience in our view refutes the assumption as evidence by the many cases like this one, in which a purchaser who may previously be unknown to a seller of marihuana is introduced to him by a friendly intermediary who can supply the name of the transferor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.307" offset="7312593">We also think it is appropriate to point out that this case seems to be a most unlikely vehicle to establish as a constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.743" offset="7350314">The doctrine that a transferee of marihuana can learn the name and address of his seller only from the seller himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.707" offset="7382183">The facts in this case show that some 10 days before the transaction on which he was convicted, petitioner sold a quantity of marihuana to narcotics agents in the kitchen of his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.334" offset="7436727">Petitioner would have the Court conclude that there was no way except from the petitioner himself that the agents could have learned his name prior to the second transaction, who we think it needs no argument, the persons who sell marihuana in the kitchens of their homes are poorly situated to conceal their names and addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.846" offset="7522722">By basing his argument on assumptions as to the practical effect of the statute, the petitioner emphasizes the critical difference between this case and Leary and it's antecedes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.189" offset="7568175">In each of those cases, the statute on its face imposed on the petitioner himself an obligation to supply certain information. It was only one way the petitioner in those cases could comply with the statute by supplying the information himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.026" offset="7647483">In the present case, it is clear that the transferor can comply fully and literally with a statute where he receives and order form for which he gave no information at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.452" offset="7701191">In his oral argument, the petitioner makes the additional contention that even if he did not supply any information to the transferee to enable the transferee to obtain the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.991" offset="7747375">That the mere fact that he receives an order form thus obtained by the transferee is an incriminatory act that is I think the language that he uses, that he adopts the language on the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.398" offset="7804949">We submit in response to that contention that there is no incrimination, there is no disclosure upon receive of the form at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3088.880" offset="12458924">With respect to Mr. Justice White's question, I believe that acceptance of the order form does more than acknowledge the man's name, that acknowledges the fact that he has transferred a stated quantity of marihuana and if he is an illegal transferor as was the petitioner here and is -- as would be virtually anyone prosecuted under this act, he would be acknowledging that he has broken the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3150.139" offset="12703953">I believe that it is the obligation to which this statute looks, that is the purpose of the buyer's name on the order form is to deal with the second purpose stated in the legislative history of this act, that is to expose all details of marihuana transactions to the scrutiny both of the federal and state officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.897" offset="12778977">If this -- if the purpose of this transfer of provision was only to prevent transfers to unlawful people, the buyer's name would be irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.347" offset="12812727">The purpose is to expose the existence of the seller as well as the buyer to all scrutiny which may follow the coming into existence of the order form.</text>

            <text syncTime="3200.658" offset="12906036">It would be a frivolous I think for him to say something like at that point he need not expose it, there would be no purpose in his having to take it in the first place if he didn't have to display it when the officials come around since this serves more than the valid -- possibly valid purpose of seeing to it that these drugs go only to a legitimate purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.033" offset="12995480">They see to it that the seller is also exposed to official scrutiny and that -- that is done by seeing to it that he maintains a copy which he reveals to appropriate --</text>

            <text syncTime="3251.817" offset="13110627">We feel that's an integrated, that's fruition of the entire buyer -- the entire seller information of the transfer order provisions of the marihuana act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.797" offset="13158588">Suppose he have the record but when the state officer called on him and ask for its exhibition, he simply stood on his claim of the Fifth Amendment and decline to do it and proceeded to test it out?</text>

            <text syncTime="3279.029" offset="13219506">I think that that would be rendering the entire transfer provisions pointless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.583" offset="13241657">There is no point to him taking the order form at all since the buyer part of it is already taken care of by the buyer's name if the seller's point is to have any purpose, it is to expose and reveal the seller if the seller were to decline to disclose the order form and he were sustained on that, there would be no point in making him take the order form in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.103" offset="13335803">And are you suggesting that the federal government has no legitimate interest in knowing the sources independent of the prosecutorial aspect that simply knowing the flow of the material?</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.969" offset="13391287">They perhaps do but they may not make the man himself, the man incriminate himself in relation to that legitimate interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.913" offset="13423052">They require him to register and maintain records of the different sort and under different provisions under this law and those provisions are perhaps valid but they cannot then require that he in effect commit another crime by refusing to reveal that he has violated the first position, the first provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.314" offset="13500583">We feel this case comes directly under the Alberts and Marchetti very line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.812" offset="13518660">In addition, the order form are all used as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.210" offset="13532244">The statute describes it as such.</text>
