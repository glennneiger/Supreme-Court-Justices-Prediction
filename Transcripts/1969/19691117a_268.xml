            <text syncTime="24.020" offset="199450">I'm Norman Smith, I represent the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.032" offset="215542">This is a companion case to the Albert case and it again has to do with our North Carolina statutory system on the rendering of guilty pleas in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.583" offset="269667">This proceeding is by habeas -- was by our statutory substitute for habeas corpus in North Carolina, our statutory Post Conviction Hearing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.057" offset="315643">There was a petition for certiorari from an adverse determination there to our Court of Appeals in North Carolina which is our intermediate Appellate Court for most matters, but which is a court of final appellate jurisdiction for post conviction matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.322" offset="372694">Again, there was an adverse determination and again petition for certiorari that was filed in this Court, which of course was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.277" offset="412505">This case has its beginnings in 1964, in the summer of 1964 the petitioner who was then a 15-year-old child was arrested by police at gun point about 11:00 one night in the City of Roanoke Rapids in North Carolina and he was taken to an interrogation cell and there he was interrogated for a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.462" offset="533191">He at first was extremely uncooperative, indeed refused to give his name and address.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.169" offset="556074">However, he apparently from some source knew that it was good idea to ask for counsel under these circumstances and the record indicates without any impeachment or contradiction that he did request that a counsel be provided for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.974" offset="631306">The police securing no fruits from their labors of interrogation on the initial interview placed him in a dimly lit or unlighted cell for the night in which there was no water available to him nor no food given to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.596" offset="697762">He was held over night and next morning he was again interrogated, this time he broke down rather quickly and did render a statement to the police, an oral statement to the effect that he had gone into the house in question and that he had committed some form of house breaking or that he had gotten through the door and some manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.085" offset="799744">The precise detail of this statement or confession is not a part of the record at any point along the way and I might like to point out to the Court here on this point that there was no hearing in Superior Court at the time the guilty plea was rendered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.129" offset="867871">That is there was no evidentiary hearing, no -- none of the state's testimony was given insofar as the record indicates and I'm not personally aware that there was one.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.245" offset="1488332">This was charged a first degree burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.571" offset="1497631">There was no indication that any other charges were being considered at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.358" offset="1512782">Although, there is a gratuitous finding by the judge, who heard the post conviction case that he shouldn't been charged with rape as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.895" offset="1542980">Incidentally, the state has made the point in its brief and I think if I may say so quite inappropriately that there was an admission of guilt by the defendant in the post conviction hearing that he fully admitted his guilt and so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.355" offset="1604838">I think a careful reading of the record indicates that the defendant did not admit guilt of either rape or burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.321" offset="1628662">He did admit that entered this house that he had relations with the woman who was there, but he was arrested as the record indicates on the very doorstep of the same house four nights later and it's quite clear that there was strong element of consent or implied consent or some sort of an arrangement which is hidden by background and has not been disclosed on the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.784" offset="1718523">I hope that there will be new trial in this case and I hope that at the new trial, the defendant will have fair and full right to bring all these matters out to the attention of the triers of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.120" offset="1771813">Also, some further brief background material on the defendant; there is a psychiatric evaluation of the petitioner in the record indicating that he is an inhibitive and impulsive individual and this likely to act in such ways to secure his immediate goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.845" offset="1838791">We suggest that in this case the immediate goal of the defendant and the overwhelming goal that loomed in front of him was the avoidance of capital punishment because of the strong racial connections which this case had in the times and spirit of the times in which the case was heard or brought up and we think that the record demonstrate that there was a very substantial fact of this present.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.488" offset="1945370">The whole theoretical basis for the Jackson case as I understand it is this compulsion or this tendency to coerce people to render involuntary pleas for them to give up their rights of trial by jury and the right to plead not guilty, the right to have a full trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.005" offset="2043382">I realize the course of the actual facts of the Jackson case and precise holding of the Jackson case go off in a different direction as the Court pointed out a moment ago in this raised argument, but it seems to me the whole theoretical basis for the Jackson case is to provide some protection for a person found in the position of the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.265" offset="2136482">We say that the evidence on the record indicates that there was substantial coercion present.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.645" offset="2169919">We say that there should be some sort of a test formulated by the Court in this case to determine when and when not to extend Jackson protection to an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.957" offset="2215163">We fully and candidly recognize that the court is not prepared to carve out a per se rule and to say that every guilty plea to every capital offense heretofore in one of those states or the federal jurisdiction where a Jackson type statute obtained must be now set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.506" offset="2293426">We do say however that some sort of test must be devised by the Court to decide when and when not to set aside these judgments and convictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.595" offset="2333759">Well, counsel could you tell me whether in any case where the death sentence is a possibility, is it permitted in your view for the defendant to plead guilty to some lesser offense?</text>

            <text syncTime="591.070" offset="2467610">My client here pleaded to the capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.949" offset="2483179">I would say, I've discussed this point in a footnote in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.665" offset="2501987">I suggested that where the lesser included offense carries a sentence so large that it is tantamount to life imprisonment that then the matter should be considered on a parity with a guilty plea carrying life imprisonment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.488" offset="2577324">And thus I suppose this rule would extend to Mrs. Bray's case.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.322" offset="2608671">Like this case as in many other cases the stopping point some where must be arbitrary and where this Court will place it or should place it, I cannot say.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.636" offset="2813889">I suggest it as I say in the footnote that maybe the stopping point would be where you get a sentence which is tantamount to life imprisonment such as Henry Alfrod's 30-year sentence although that's not in my case and I really unable to say with certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.201" offset="2872195">I would think that the test -- that the Court should invoke in these cases is something like a test devise in Chapman versus California, carrying forward the realization that in not every case would the guilty plea be set aside, but only in those cases where the evidence made some showing that the fear of the death house, the fear of the gas chamber had an effect, substantial effect.</text>

Cochran and Fay v. Noia and the other waiver cases that this Court has determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.721" offset="4798255">We say there cannot be a valid waiver when it takes place in a vacuum, when it takes place in the midst of ignorance and lack of information, lack of discussion so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.941" offset="7319176">I'd like to spend some time on this question of grand jury discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.202" offset="7356165">Mr. Smith was the post conviction attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.605" offset="7377795">He represented Mr. Parker at the post conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.433" offset="7409142">The only witness put on the stand was a Register of Deeds of Halifax County and from the testimony of Mr. Smith's witness or Mr. Wilson's testimony, it was apparent that there was no racial discrimination that the -- then statutory scheme in North Carolina was that the names for the grand jury were selected from the tax rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.286" offset="7536515">Admittedly, at that time, there were tax rolls maintain for both Caucasian and white -- excuse me Caucasian and Negro, this is subsequently been changed by statute and no longer exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.089" offset="7591685">The tax rolls had to prepare that way but the names in the jury box had no indication, no racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.769" offset="7634422">The testimony presented by Mr. Smith's witness show that the jury commissioners came from different parts of the county, selected individuals who were known to them to be of good moral character that the same criteria were applied uniformly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.684" offset="7722088">Now, I submit that perhaps what we get to in this instance is something akin to the former blue ribbon grand jury selection used in the Federal District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.808" offset="7782588">There is no deliberate showing of racial exclusion, merely a showing that these jury commissioners pick up people known to them to be a good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.514" offset="7845386">Perhaps of any issue confronting this Court today, this issue could perhaps to be most vital because it is counsel's contention here that unless there is a free, voluntary and knowing waiver of the right to attack the grand jury that that attack can be made at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.858" offset="7958758">So, it would appear that not only upon a plea of guilty, if counsel's arguments were to be followed, but also upon a plea of not guilty, unless the state could show that the waiver to attack the grand jury was freely, voluntarily and understandingly made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.725" offset="8046320">In the State of North Carolina since 1902, for the case of State v. Peoples, the Supreme Court of North Carolina has held that a defendant who cold show racial exclusion in the composition of the grand jury which indicted him was entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.018" offset="8119463">Our statutes expressly provide that the method of grand jury selection maybe attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.717" offset="8146213">That attack has to come either one, prior to arraignment or two, prior to swearing in of the petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.040" offset="8183515">This rule is quite similar to the rule in effect in the federal system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.483" offset="8533347">The federal rules provide that you can attack grand jury selection at any time prior, I believe similar here it is Rule 12 (b) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.891" offset="8582980">The federal rules of criminal procedure provide defenses and objections based on defects in the institution of the prosecution or in the indictment or information other than it fails to show jurisdiction to the court would charge an offense maybe raise only by motion before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.208" offset="8648182">Motion shall include all such defenses and objections then available to defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.573" offset="8677648">I submit that in either a trial upon a plea of not guilty or trial upon or submission of a guilty plea that this could have a horrendous effect if this Court were now to require that each and every such instance that the waiver be on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.112" offset="8767822">The federal system had blue ribbon grand jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.977" offset="8787257">Not only of what we are talking now about Negro defendants, we're talking about Spanish-American defendants, we're talking about Puerto Rican and an attack could be made in the federal system, if collateral attack could be made on grand jury selection on behalf of every indigent white defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.272" offset="8880462">Because the former system in effect in the federal courts under the former blue ribbon system of grand jury selection presented a middle class grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.067" offset="8939604">The indigents were not on that grand jury and so I submit that the total effect here would permit every defendant convicted on either plea of guilty or not guilty, unless somehow an express waiver could be shown that he would be now be permitted to collaterally attack the grand jury which indicted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.284" offset="9044511">That this defendant is not given the opportunity to choose his own time and his own place to contest his guilt now that the evidence is in most instances no longer available now that the witnesses have moved or they forgotten, now that many instances are dead and the evidence has been destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.984" offset="9131342">I submit that the picture presented would perhaps completely overburden the courts of all the states and of the federal judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.831" offset="9234683">This case of course also presents the Jackson issue and also presents the issue of whether or not Jackson is retroactive, if Jackson is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.699" offset="9286196">There are at the present time according to my research either eight or nine states which have possible Jackson defects if this Court should rule that these defects do exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.109" offset="9343770">In the federal system of course there's a Federal Kidnapping Act, the Federal Bank Rubbery Act, there is the sale of narcotics to minors, the Atomic Secrets Act, here in the District of Columbia there is the rape statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.920" offset="9411062">The Court of Appeals of course for the District of Columbia has previously held in Bailey versus United States that retroactivity is not to be applied in the rape statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.658" offset="9466023">The effect once again, if retroactivity were to applied regardless of the argument previously presented that while the state is going to retry them after all some of these defendants have served a great deal of time and they are eligible for parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.819" offset="9546689">This argument I think denies the -- is an argument of expediency in that regard because that argument says, well, there are a great number of men, but however they'll be eligible for parole and good number them on attack.</text>
