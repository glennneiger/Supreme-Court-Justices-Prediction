            <text syncTime="42.810" offset="274578">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.648" offset="289938">This case is before the Court on short certiorari to review a per curiam order of the Court of Appeals for District of Columbia which enforce a supplemental order of National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.106" offset="339780">The Board's order was entered that gives the petitioner H. K. Porter Company supposedly as a remedy for bad-faith bargaining in violation of Section 885 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.911" offset="395055">More specifically, the company was found to have refused to agree to a union's demand for a dues checkoff provision for the purpose of frustrating an agreement with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.863" offset="442807">The Board supplemental order which is the focal point of this controversy before this Court requires the company to “grant to the union a contract clause providing for the checkoff of union dues.”</text>
            <text syncTime="100.882" offset="506859">The very precise, very clear cut issue now presented is whether the Board under the National Labor Relations Act has the power to order a party to agree to a substantive provision of a collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.970" offset="567254">The company of course takes position that Board has not has such power.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.972" offset="583241">The Board now says that it has the power to order agreement to a substantive provision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald C. Winson</label>
            <text syncTime="132.862" offset="634859">The substantive provision Mr. Justice Black was a dues checkoff provision -- a provision of course and a collective-bargaining agreement by which the company pays and assist the union in the collection of dues by deducting the due -- union dues from the employees’ wages and then transmits them to the union.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="152.606" offset="713749">In other words that the Board said that this was a demand of the union to which the company must agree?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald C. Winson</label>
            <text syncTime="163.555" offset="757635">The way the case worked out Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, it actually worked that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.344" offset="780727">The Court of Appeals is actually if I may say so the instigator of the remedy here is as to what has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.088" offset="811760">This case went through the Examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.040" offset="823568">The Examiner recommended the general bargaining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.002" offset="835375">The case then went up to the Board, the Board adopted the general bargaining order, it went to the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.013" offset="859408">The District of Columbia Circuit enforced and refused the union's request for a direct order which we are now arguing about which was later entered but on the first time up the District of Columbia rejected the union’s petition, District of Columbia Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.028" offset="919489">Then, after that occurred, we filed a petition for certiorari with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.708" offset="942164">We took the position that because of the wording used in the opinion, it seemed to us that the Court of Appeals was telling us if you want to avoid contempt, you had better agree without any further talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.193" offset="988139">Well, when the Court -- when this Court denied our petition for cert, we then took the interpretation which we felt we had to under the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.993" offset="1015306">We interpret the law that the general bargaining order required us to bargain over a dues collection system but not simply to walk in and agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.588" offset="1049684">The union took the position of those subsequent negotiations said, no Porter you are now required to agree and we don’t have to talk to you any more about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.940" offset="1083120">You are required to agree to do dues checkoff provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.698" offset="1094196">Well, did not the original opinion of the Court of Appeals suggest that very thing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald C. Winson</label>
            <text syncTime="251.586" offset="1109765">It suggested that in order to avoid contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.565" offset="1121677">The Court could not see how we could avoid agreeing.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.170" offset="1136097">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, when we went then went -- gone in the position of the verge of interpretations of this original bargaining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.110" offset="1163786">The union then asked the Board to initiate a contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.434" offset="1185102">The Board's Regional Director advised the parties that the company had now complied with the bargaining order and that the case was thereby closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.990" offset="1223346">The union then found a motion for clarification with the District of Columbia Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.126" offset="1243826">The first time, the Circuit Court denied the motion for clarification and said, we think contempt is a proper route to test compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.841" offset="1274755">Then, the union went back to the Court of Appeals for the second motion asking for reconsideration of the earlier motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.682" offset="1306102">This time, the Court of Appeals came up with an opinion of course remanded the case to the Board and that's why we have a supplemental order before this Court and instead of the original order.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.057" offset="1343613">The Court of Appeals in its second opinion, its clarifying opinion told the Board that we feel under the -- that Section 8 (d) of the Act does not prohibit the Board for entering an order to agree to a substantive contract provision and that the Board can either order agreement directly or it can compel a concession that will be given in exchange for the demanded provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.892" offset="1698983">This case presents to the Board or presents to this Court for the first time in the 35-year history of the National Labor Relations Act a situation in which the Board has ordered one party to agree to a contract term.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.530" offset="1761468">We submit that this order violates both the specific intent of Congress as expressed in the wording of Section 8 (d) of the Act as well as the basic premise of freedom of contract as contained and has been recognized to exist in Section 8 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="431.899" offset="1830954">This Section of the Act provides that the obligation to bargaining good faith does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession and of course this Court in both the American National Insurance case and the Insurance Agents case recognized Section 8 (d) as prohibiting the Board from either directly or indirectly, compelling concessions or from otherwise sitting in judgment on the terms that collective-bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.886" offset="1954879">It's true that Section 10 (c) of the Act permits the Board to enter such remedial orders such affirmative orders as will effectuate the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.840" offset="1998764">We recognized the distinction that the Court of Appeals and the Board and the union are now arguing that Section 8 (d) itself does not directly relate by express terms to the scope of the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.502" offset="2053413">But it certainly expresses a fundamental policy of the Act that of freedom of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.199" offset="2076191">This Court and the cases I cited a moment ago recognized that that -- the intent of Congress and the legislative history was well cited by Mr. Justice Brennan in the Insurance Agents case that the intent of Congress was to keep the Board from either directly or indirectly compelling agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.654" offset="2149961">We contend that the supplemental order is in clear derogation in violation of this fundamental policy and it’s interesting that the Board until a supplemental order took exactly the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.884" offset="2206908">The Board did not enter even though union demanded that the Board did not enter a direct order to agree initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.181" offset="2236061">And in fact, when we filed our petition for cert the first time in this Court, the Board took the position that if bargaining order did not violate Section 8 (d) that it merely orders to bargain in good faith and they pointed out specifically that they had not violated Section 8 (d).</text>

            <text syncTime="654.196" offset="2720162">And of course I point out that the Board's Regional Director subsequent to this original bargaining order found that the company had bargained.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.228" offset="3180335">I would like to call the Court’s attention if I may to the approach used by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.953" offset="3203218">The Court of Appeals very properly recognized that freedom of contract is a fundamental policy and premise of the Act and they agreed that remedies which impinge on it are not to be lightly undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.622" offset="3253896">But they then pointed out under that Section 10 (c) the Board is to balance the policies and this is to try to move forward onto all policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.023" offset="3291512">They then cited the -- what they considered to be an equal policy and that is a policy of the Act to equalize the bargaining power of an employees and employers by assuring the right of workers to bargain collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.356" offset="3348773">The Court of Appeals then proceeded to cite such alleged facts as the fact that the dues checkoff provision is in 92% of industry contracts, the dues checkoff is likely to be a life or death import to a fledgling union.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.862" offset="3418781">The dues checkoff provision and ordering evidence is only a minor intrusion on freedom of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.360" offset="3440828">They even cited the fact that the union’s nearest office was 85 miles away that the employees were scattered over a wide area.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.157" offset="3471966">The Court concluded that the collection of dues without dues checkoff provision had presented the union with a substantial problem of communication in transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.716" offset="3514284">We submit that this approach although laudatory in the balancing of the policies but this approach of looking at the need of the union for this provision and in saying its of little effect to the company and of course it has been cited all through the record at the original hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.145" offset="3583979">The company said, we're not objecting as a matter of inconvenience and so forth cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.689" offset="3602160">I submit that this is exactly what 8 (d) prohibits that 8 (d) and that this Court has recognized that 8 (d), the Congress prohibited the board from policing the needs, from sitting in judgment on whether one party should have had the provision and the other party didn’t have good enough reason for denying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.702" offset="3690141">In fact, I also suggest that this area of whether a business reason is needed for refusing a contract demand by the other bargaining party is part of the issue of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.373" offset="6804877">Now, since it's been a finding of bad-faith bargaining there may be primary -- preliminary issues of whether it’s a run-of-the-mill case that was suggested to us or it may be a question of whether it would be a minor intrusion or so forth, that's been suggested to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.706" offset="6854196">But in any event, the Board would have a power to order the company to agree to the very contract provision which the union could not obtain at the bargaining tables.</text>

            <text syncTime="2673.628" offset="10797850">And this employer was making that a touchstone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2695.798" offset="10886562">He agreed that there was no greater inconvenience in doing it for union dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.628" offset="10917909">And indeed, the further conceded that at other plants they did checkoff union dues and as the company counsel stated at one point in the record that page 16 that perhaps our refusal to grant the checkoff clause has been harassed of the international union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.722" offset="11026265">Now, given this history in this context, the Board was justified in concluding as it did and as the Court of Appeals agreed that this was not a company that had a good faith reason for withholding the checkoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.931" offset="11123127">We are not suggesting that an employer has to grant a checkoff, they cannot in good faith refuse to grant a checkoff, but this was an employer who withhold a checkoff for the sole reason of blocking an agreement with the union and that indeed he had indicated that not only was this his reason but he had no other reason for withholding a checkoff.</text>

            <text syncTime="3697.445" offset="14893119">And that the sole purpose for refusing to grant it was to frustrate in agreement with the union as Justice Black said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.998" offset="14931362">The company went through the motions of bargaining what it really didn’t want in agreement and it was holding off on the checkoff because that was the way of carrying out its scheme of frustrating an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.539" offset="14993533">Now, further more you have a record which shows did not only was this employer has reason but he had no other conceivable reason for opposing a checkoff so that you'll have a refusal to bargain in good faith over the checkoff based upon this kind of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.272" offset="15092485">And the limited question in this case is not whether the Board has power to compel concessions under other circumstances but whether given this particular unfair labor practice finding that it is grounded as I have indicated the Board as a remedy for the refusal -- that kind of a refusal bargain clearly order a checkoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.969" offset="15203244">And we submit that if you get this kind of a unique situation, a checkoff -- in order to grant the checkoff is really the only frank thing to do because an order to bargain in good faith suggests that there's something left that you could bargain about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.423" offset="15297076">Now, in the situation that I have presented, the employer has so painted himself into the corner that there is nothing to talk about -- talk would only make for additional delay because as the Court of Appeals pointed out when he goes back he can't give the same reasons that he gave before for refusing a checkoff and to permit him at this point to manufacture new reasons that he admitted before were not a factor but make a mockery of the collective-bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.292" offset="15440541">So what we're left with then is whether or not 8 (d) in this particular situation that I'm talking about would preclude the Board from using its 10 (c) powers which would otherwise be broad enough to permit this kind of a remedy when absolutely by the Board in this situation from ordering a checkoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.364" offset="15552867">We submit that it does not for the reason that the legislative history of 8 (d) shows that what Congress was concerned about there was the Board making the initial finding of bad faith based upon the failure of the employer to concede or to a union proposal because of the Board’s judgment that since it was a reasonable proposal, it was unreasonable and therefore bad faith for him to refuse to agree.</text>

            <text syncTime="5831.239" offset="23428368">That’s right Mr. Justice Black and the company was found to a bargain of bad faith for the purpose of frustrating an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5837.659" offset="23453968">Incidentally, that raises a question of whether it's a mandatory subject and then somebody said it never been raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.657" offset="23478000">In the earlier proceedings before the Court of Appeals, we did argue that where we were not convinced that at that time I'm not personally not convince now that it is a mandatory subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.667" offset="23518020">But obviously it was not something to be raise in this proceeding before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5858.497" offset="23537351">So we have not -- do not have this as an issue right now, but there have been references characterizing this case in a number in different ways now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5866.344" offset="23568697">As we mentioned earlier, the union in its brief talks of this that this remedy that they're after here could not be use is a Ronald case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.739" offset="23606314">The Court of Appeals said that in ordering a checkoff is only a minor intrusion on agreement contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5882.382" offset="23632854">Now, today, it said that this is a unique situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5886.968" offset="23651244">Well, as Judge Miller in his dissenting opinion initially on the merits of this case, he concluded by saying that he never seen case so barren of support for the bad faith finding found by the Examiner and adopted by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5904.059" offset="23719581">Now, we're not here to argue the facts obviously but all I'm saying is that for anybody to say this case is unique or this or that case is where the Miller, that’s always a decision that has to be made their people when you disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5917.223" offset="23772244">Congress in its wisdom did not, and nobody has cited any authority that Congress empower the Board to decide on the basis of characterizing cases whether it can order agreement or whether it couldn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.989" offset="23823339">Counsel for the Board argued today when asked the question, well, where do we draw the line, where do you suggest we draw the line?</text>
            <text syncTime="5936.948" offset="23851133">He said this about the present case where he says that it's within the imaginary line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5941.883" offset="23870882">Here, there was a bargaining in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="5944.305" offset="23880600">Well, there's a bargaining in bad faith in every case you don't approach the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5948.600" offset="23897736">The question of 8 (a) 5 remedy unless there's bad faith bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.345" offset="23912782">He said there was no business or legitimate reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.292" offset="23924590">I know of no law I don’t think there's law right now to the extent that you have to have a business reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.147" offset="23947995">I don't think our law has approach that point and I suggest to that is probably an important issue now or an important consideration in this case whether business reasons are or not needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.897" offset="23990941">The third thing, he said was a checkoff provision as cut-and-dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5976.342" offset="24008704">Well, I wonder sometimes whether a checkoff is cut-and dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.816" offset="24022601">It can affect other provisions, it can affect the wage provisions for example obviously if the union wants the checkoff provision badly enough, they're going to give up 2 cents an hour to get it or 3 cents what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5991.939" offset="24071084">So I suggest that these two considerations that have been brought forth today are exactly in the character of the Congress told the Board to stay away from in 8 (a) 5 and that is a sitting in judgment on whether the case is unique, whether it’s cu-and-dry, whether there were good reasons for refusing the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.157" offset="24156035">I suggest this, I would conclude with the point from the Chamber’s brief of footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.772" offset="24190412">It pointed out that be sitting here today that this question of Board intrusion in the bargaining process did not come anew in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="6034.013" offset="24239417">I'm referred to the legislative history back with the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 and the is footnote on page 5 of the Chamber's brief where Senator Wolf, chairman of the Committee in Education and Labor said that nothing in this Bill allows the federal government or any agency to fix wages, regulates rates of pay and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6054.428" offset="24321128">There is nothing in this Bill that compels any employer to make any agreement about wages, hours, employment or working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6061.690" offset="24350177">I merely suggest that this treat of freedom of contract in the basic premise throughout the Act Section 8 (d) is the focal point by which is brought forth but this basic premise is there the Court of Appeals did not deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6078.196" offset="24416110">The Board and the union in our brief do not deny.</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.305" offset="24424573">Instead, they say that they should be allowed to agree whenever the intrusion of freedom contract is only minor.</text>
