            <label>Mr. Harold I. Apolinsky</label>

            <label>Mr. Harold I. Apolinsky</label>
            <text syncTime="146.725" offset="690239">That's right and in this situation, this partnership operated 10 finance businesses, two in South Carolina and eight in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.286" offset="744469">It made loans to the public and it used the accrual method of accounting under which it would take into its ordinary income the profit on a loan, the receivable in the year in which the loan was made and the receivable established.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.957" offset="831195">It accounted for its bad debts by the use of the reserve method for the bad debts allowed under Section 166 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.332" offset="872678">Actually, a taxpayer can use either of two methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.796" offset="894516">It can use the direct charge-off method which allows you to charge against income in the year that the account goes bad or a taxpayer can anticipate its losses as far as specific accounts are concerned and establish a reserve for bad debts and based on its experience, estimate the amount of the accounts receivable which will go bad and charge that amount against income when it establishes its reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.590" offset="1053759">The reserve is reviewed annually and any additions to the reserve are likewise charged against income as a deduction and they're limited of course to the reasonableness of the reserve which in our situation is stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.363" offset="1140799">On May 31, 1960, the partnership had about approximately $487,000.00 worth of receivables in these eight Alabama offices and approximately a $73,000.00 balance in its reserve for bad debts applicable to those eight offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.433" offset="1233063">It then on June 1 transferred to eight separate corporations for it attained a benefit under the Alabama loan licensing statutes by have eight separate corporate offices that could lend money and it transferred to those eight offices the receivables applicable to the eight corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.586" offset="1345703">The furniture and fixtures applicable to the eight corporations, cash applicable to the eight corporations and liabilities taking back stock and security solely for the net value transferred to the partnership to the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.883" offset="1438908">It continued the same businesses in the eight corporations and what it did, the corporations then set up the reserve, they had an opening balance which they reflected in their reserve for bad debts in total and we’re dealing here in both briefs with the total concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.651" offset="1525948">The total amount of the reserves reflected in the opening balance sheets of these eight corporations was $73,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.551" offset="1577566">In 1962, the Commission of Internal Revenue issued his Revenue Ruling 62-128 where he first expressed the position that the reserve for which being maintained by a partnership would be taken back into the ordinary income of the partnership when it transfers its assets even though such transfer being under the tax free rules generally of Section 351 and thereafter, the Commissioner's agent examined the returns of the partnership which made a determination that the $73,000.00 of reserve should be restored to the ordinary income of the partnership in its year which ended in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.149" offset="1795950">This increased the distributive share of income to the partners and therefore the partner’s income increased in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.283" offset="1840462">They paid their tax, filed a claim for refund and filed suit in District Court, the District Court upholding the taxpayer's position that the reserve would not be restored to income relying on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case of the Estate of Heinz Schmidt.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.118" offset="1915800">The Government’s appeal to the Fifth Circuit where the Fifth Circuit said they disagreed with the Ninth Circuit and agreed with the Tax Court and sustained the Commissioner's position and hence this writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.150" offset="1988002">We maintain that the clear legislative history of Section 351 precludes this end rule, this creation of income to the partnership when it incorporates its business under that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.316" offset="2060622">It came into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.427" offset="2065115">Section 351 came into the law in 1921 at the same time Congress first enacted the reorganization provisions and also enacted the tax free exchanges of real estate provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.955" offset="2127182">And the Senate's Finance Committee in its report in 1921 said that they had been -- they recounted that the prior law, under the prior law before 1921, this would have been a taxable event, a reorganization or the organization of a corporation as we have here would be in a taxable event before 1921 and they said there had been no provision which had more seriously interfered with necessary business readjustments than these prior laws and therefore they put in these tax free exchange provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.435" offset="2285066">They said they specifically sought to eliminate technical constructions which are economically unsound and interfered with necessary business readjustments.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.341" offset="2332714">In 1924, Congress considered the carryover basis sections of the code which are the corollary to tax-free exchanges, the corporation taking a carryover basis and they had an opportunity to express their views again, the House Ways and Means Committee as to the purpose of the predecessor of Section 351 of the Code where they said that this Section 351 and the reorganization sections were not intended to be exemptions from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.666" offset="2486000">That they were recognitions that these changes were merely changes in form and not in substance and would not be given to recognition of income, that any recognition of income would be postponed until there was an actual sale or a taxable exchange.</text>

            <text syncTime="2526.119" offset="10207796">Section 381 of the Internal Revenue Code is the principal provision which allows for carryovers in certain transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.228" offset="10252309">That provision does not apply to transactions such as the one here which is described in Section 351.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.614" offset="10329840">In addition to the fact, the absence in Section 381 of a specific congressional authorization for a carryover, it is well established that a transferee in a Section 351 transaction is a new taxpayer and can adopt its own accounting methods and its own taxable year including in this specific case the specific charge off method of accounting for bad debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.579" offset="10453661">We think therefore that there is a real risk of a double deduction if this Court should hold that the tax benefit principle is not applicable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.235" offset="11896351">But if the accounts receivable happened to be a capital asset in the hands of the selling entity in the hypothetical that you posited, then the gain or the loss would be a capital loss and the restoration to income would be a restoration to ordinary income.</text>

            <text syncTime="2980.363" offset="12024874">I think I should point out that the purpose of the reserve method of accounting for bad debts is to better match costs against revenue just as it has been pointed out in the briefs but that purpose was never intended to provide a loss to an entity that didn't suffer it and that once we know that the partnership entity is terminated, the partnership should not wind up with any more bad debt deductions than it would have wound up would had it been on the specific charge off method of accounting for bad debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.859" offset="12142843">And had it been on this specific charge off method, it would not have gotten this deduction for future losses which it took and which we submit has to be restored to income when the partnership terminates.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold I. Apolinsky</label>
            <text syncTime="3036.310" offset="12248586">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.850" offset="12258722">I think that the statement of Mr. Zinn points up the problem they have in applying the tax benefit rule realistically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.497" offset="12293308">They set forth the rule but they don’t apply certainly in the taxable exchange area when there's a cash sale of accounts receivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.673" offset="12334059">The rule as set forth in their brief says you restore to income a deduction when you recover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.407" offset="12364988">Well, If you have a sale for the receivables at gross, that’s a recovery and it would come in income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.491" offset="12389334">If you have a sale at net, the most logical conclusion seems to me is that you have no recovery under the tax benefit rule and therefore there’s no income to the taxpayer selling in a taxable transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.076" offset="12439698">The Government in order to bend the rule to fit our tax free situation sets up a hypothesis that they have a loss realized on the receivables which counteracts the return to income of the reserve and the wash result is a net of zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.060" offset="12519633">We say that's an incorrect approach to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.574" offset="12533635">The loss occurred when the taxpayer got the deduction for the reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.812" offset="12558608">When you set it up, that's when the deduction occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.124" offset="12567907">The fact that later on, he sold it net was merely a realization that his estimate, his loss was correct, not a subsequent loss down the road to offset some artificial inclusion in income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.764" offset="12638438">We further say that we do not agree in our brief and our brief, I think shows that, that there is a different rule to apply in Section 337 liquidations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.980" offset="12679293">We don't -- I did not cover that because it’s covered in my brief but Mr. Zinn said that we did agree and we do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.451" offset="12709177">In fact, the revenue ruling in 1957 where the Government covered the liquidation under a one year liquidation rule specifically set up the hypothesis that the corporation sold its receivables at face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.356" offset="12776782">And they said, therefore the reserve comes back into income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.259" offset="12788381">Well, that seems to be the tax benefit rule in its proper application and I've set out that entire revenue ruling in the last page of my appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.212" offset="12824221">I also take issue with Mr. Zinn when he disputes whether upon the liquidation of a partnership the reserve comes into income of the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.103" offset="12859747">In my judgment, in a pro rata liquidation of a partnership under Section 736, there is no recognition of income to the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.292" offset="12908544">I would just focus our attention if I will on the question, the Government has assumed as we said that there is a problem of a double deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.370" offset="12952848">We maintain that there is no problem of a double deduction because there has been no, in our case, no one has tried to take a second deduction and in no case discussed today or in any of the brief has any taxpayer attempted to take a second deduction at any stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.993" offset="13031320">So that the basis hypothesis for the need for the revenue ruling it seems to me unfounded that there is not second deduction to guard against and therefore, without that problem, there’s no need to even travel under 7805 but under that Section, the solution if we were to assume for argument there’s a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.839" offset="13110732">Under that Section, the solution has to be consistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.848" offset="13126719">We say that Section 351 which says no gain or loss if property is transferred, if, it doesn’t say from property, it’s not tied to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.752" offset="13166425">It says if property is transferred, that the legislative history of that Section points out that that’s not a taxable event, it’s just a change of form and in 1924, Congress in reviewing it said, no gain or loss and in the next sentence, it says, this is not a time for the realization of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.619" offset="13249808">So we say there is no magic in saying what we have over here is income and the statute said no gain, loss or income because in 1924, they used the two terms interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.220" offset="13312293">Certainly, the cure to the illness should not be worse than the illness itself and that’s what’s going to happen if we restore to the partnership this income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.102" offset="13347819">It creates artificial tax planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.767" offset="13358477">Partners, proprietors, transfer into corporations can't put receivables into their corporations because if that mature the reserve for bad debts, they would not then have any cash to pay the income tax with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.939" offset="13411140">So what's happened since 1962 is that people with reserve for bad debts have been artificially holding out their receivables, or else possibly making cash sales at nets to third parties to create what the Government says is a wash situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.448" offset="13481148">That -- and this is a recurring problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.161" offset="13495986">The Government in their petition for certiorari agrees that we have incorporations of businesses everyday and it just seems to me that we should not visit the need for some artificial planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.599" offset="13553768">Congress in 1921 said, to order, to encourage business readjustments and even spoke of artificial transactions that they were going to place this tax free environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.544" offset="13601520">The simplest thing I think is not to look to a specific solution to a double deduction, we say there isn’t or to simply for the court to remind the tax bar is we don’t need reminding of your decision of Skelly Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.386" offset="13656900">There is just not going to be any second deduction allowed irrespective of which particular route is followed and we urge that the Fifth Circuit be reversed and that the District Court's decision be affirmed so that the partnership in this situation would not take into its income the reserve for bad debts.</text>
