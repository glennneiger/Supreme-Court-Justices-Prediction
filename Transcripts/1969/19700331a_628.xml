            <text syncTime="1072.090" offset="4391685">And the only way to purchase certainty in this area is to go ahead and appear in what you think is a motion picture, a theatrical production and see if you're brought the trial if you're wearing a symbolic -- if you're wearing as in Danny's case parts of an Armed Forces uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.511" offset="4449468">The vagueness contained therein is offensive to the Fifth and First Amendment, the Schacht's First Amendment rights and what it actually does is grant a license to whomever is in charge of bringing -- of bringing charges, it give a license to them, an official of the government to bring charges in cases where he doesn't agree with what is being said in a play or if – and he can use the vagueness of the word production to justify the imposition of this charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1300.540" offset="5305553">If in fact the Court does find that the words tend to discredit are unconstitutional, again, we are left with Title 18 which grants an exception in instances of plays in which one is wearing distinctive parts of the uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.613" offset="5365844">There are pages and pages in the transcript which exemplify the prosecuting attorney, the defense lawyer and the judges' confusion over exactly what production means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.217" offset="5412237">Nobody knows exactly what it means within the framework of the statute and they finally decide on the Webster dictionary definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.103" offset="5447764">Of course, if there -- if this kind of confusion exists for lawyers and for the judge at the trial, think of the kind of burden that imposes on anyone trying to make a good faith effort to ascertain under the statute whether or not he's going to be in a motion picture or theatrical production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.431" offset="5517145">We say the statute fails for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.190" offset="5528116">This presents a chilling affect on First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.423" offset="5541073">One must step back and just fail to exercise the right to free speech, to act in a play because you don't know whether or not you're accepted under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.778" offset="5574510">But more importantly to us, it presents an opportunity to any government official who has the opportunity to bring charges under the statute based on what he feels is a violation of the act and in cases where he doesn't feel that the production can be proved by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.735" offset="5654340">What this means to us is that defendant Schacht was tried under statute that's seldom used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.576" offset="5689657">Although there is widespread disuse of -- although there is widespread wearing of distinctive parts of the uniform, of parts similar to distinctive parts of the uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.350" offset="5732812">He wore it in a part of the country in which dissent is not very popular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.628" offset="5757889">We feel that the law was unconstitutionally applied to him for the sole purpose of punishing his participation in the act, any Vietnam War skit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.699" offset="5794147">There are record references which support this contention, very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.933" offset="5823091">The defense attorney 209 -- the prosecuting attorney at 209 says, if the Court please, in our original charge we found with the Court, we did provide a separate charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.650" offset="5861961">We feel that the defendants were entitled to a charge with respect to the defense and if I may present this to the Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.225" offset="5888293">The -- Mr. 2406, the defense attorney says, “Excuse me, you have the word betrayal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.873" offset="5906892">We are getting kind of bad aren't we instead of portrayal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.677" offset="5918072">Mr. K, the prosecuting attorney says, “Excuse me, we have betrayal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.244" offset="5936358">The Court -- some people might view it as a betrayal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.897" offset="5946911">What about the definition of those terms?</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.058" offset="5955584">In the closing argument at 382, Mr. Hartman for the US government in indicating the view point, indicating the view point of this office about this sort of thing that Danny engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.455" offset="6005217">If it pleases the Court ladies and gentlemen, the only thing I gather with the argument of these defendants, they are displeased with the government and the war, but I have a single answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.071" offset="6039698">There's a plane and a boat leaving, two or three times a day for other parts of the world.</text>

            <text syncTime="1490.805" offset="6066552">You can leave anytime if you don't like and then you stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.896" offset="6078986">At 384 he says, if he referring to the defendants, comes to my house and expresses himself like this, he will not be able to walk into this Court room and be tried again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.955" offset="6119215">And I say to you, there are many others likely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.957" offset="6127156">I don't to rub shoulders with these two, do you?</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.794" offset="6138546">We say that this is clear evidence that what we have here is not a case involving simply the wearing of distinctive parts of the uniform.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.583" offset="7241749">I will direct myself first to the jurisdictional question which has been raised in the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.198" offset="7280201">When I first came to my present office some time ago, I was rather surprised to find occasional briefs coming across my desk in which it said the petition was filed out of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.978" offset="7343313">Nevertheless, there is no reason for granting certiorari and then going on to argue the question of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.486" offset="7381347">I raised the question with my associates and they said, “Oh, it's not jurisdictional.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.300" offset="7404544">And I was puzzled by that, but there are lots of things that I find puzzling and don't always find answers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.124" offset="7447907">And I went along and noticed those cases continuing until this case came when the Court granted certiorari 131 days after the judgment of the Court below and I couldn't see any reason why if they could grant it a 131 days, it couldn't be granted at 1131 days or at anytime and I asked my associate Mr. Connelly to look into it and we dug into it rather thoroughly and I will endeavor to summarize here what we found in looking into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.254" offset="7644348">Of course there was originally the basic statute of 1925 which provided a period of three months for certiorari with respect to all types of judgments with a power in the Court to or a justice at the Court to extend that for 60 days on an application made within the three months period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.281" offset="7748524">And then in 1933, Congress authorized the Court by a statute which says that the Court shall have the power to prescribe and I think prescribe has some significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.027" offset="7823444">From time to time, rules of practice and I think rules has some significance and by an amendment made in 1934, it was provided that the rules made as here in authorized may prescribe the times for and manner of taking appeals and applying for writs of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.967" offset="7919261">And the committee reports at that time read in a way which sounds contemporary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2129.108" offset="8619760">Now, since 1934 when rule 11 was first adopted, the rules have gone through various changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.960" offset="8659257">In 1946, the language was changed from shall to may and someone might think that “Well, that's just permissive and that means it isn't really binding” it says beginning in 1946, it said “Maybe made within 30 days”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.146" offset="8747969">Another change was made in 1946 which was to grant authority to a Justice of the Court to extend the time not exceeding 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.724" offset="8798229">If the application was made “Within the 30 day period following judgment” and the advisory committee at that time in its notes said “This rule continues existing law, except that it grants to the Supreme Court or a Justice thereof the authority to extend the time."</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.462" offset="8893210">And of course, the existing law included not only the text to the rule but also this Court's decision in the Coy case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2258.191" offset="9136149">Judge Smith had granted a new trial long after the five days, put in the rule, he tempted to justify it on the grounds that he had done it sue sponte, that the rule simply said that application must be made within 5 days but it said nothing about what the judge did himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.975" offset="9239280">But this Court reversed the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.435" offset="9253073">I may point out too that this rule with respect to appeal also contain the may language which was introduced in 1946 both with respect to appeals and with respect to certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="2967.895" offset="11974928">I think that that was what was contemplated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.392" offset="11988929">I think that's what the words prescribe by rule mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.368" offset="12008887">That was clearly the understanding of the informed commentators at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.544" offset="12029576">Professor Orfield, for example, referred to the fact that the rule is jurisdictional and that was the almost contemporaneous decision of this Court in the Coy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.979" offset="12075238">Now, I referred to the fact that the language has changed to may, it also changed to may with respect to appeals and this Court in the Robinson case in 361 U. S., it is cited in our brief and involved a late filing of a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.153" offset="12151933">And the Court held that the may language there was compulsory that the appeal with the appellant Court got not jurisdiction when the appeal was filed more than five days late and it quoted with approval the language from United States against Smith, the phrase of -- lingers on indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.815" offset="12246601">And in concluding its opinion, it said something further which seems to me to be relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.998" offset="12271365">That powerful policy argument maybe made both for and against greater flexibility with respect to the time for taking of an appeal is indeed evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.216" offset="12316191">But that policy question involving as it does many witty and conflicting consideration must be resolved through the rule making process and not by judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.714" offset="12366242">If by that process the Courts are ever given power to extend the time for the filing on a notice of appeal upon a finding of excusable neglect, it seems reasonable to think that some definite limitation upon the time within which they may do so would be prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.111" offset="12447848">So, it seems to me that the case is tolerably clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.970" offset="12471254">The purpose of the rules was to cut down delays to restrict the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.918" offset="12495078">Congress was not clear just how much would be workable and delegated the authority to cut down the time to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.933" offset="12535097">And then there's the language of the statutory authorization or to prescribe by rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.445" offset="12569161">And then there's the language of the rules themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.584" offset="12593716">The rules provide that the petition should be filed within 30 days, they provide further that a justice may extend the time within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.973" offset="12659231">And then there is a very interesting further provision in the rules of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.503" offset="12681383">Rule 34 says that whenever any justice of this Court is empowered by law to extend the time, an application seeking such extension must be presented to the Court within the period sought to be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.874" offset="12750869">And there its must not may, it is specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.666" offset="12778036">And finally, there was the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.211" offset="12792247">In the Coy case in 316 U. S. and in the Smith and Robinson cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.113" offset="12823803">Well now, what happened to upset this clear picture?</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.011" offset="12851388">Nothing deliberate, I may point out that in the Coy case in the order granting certiorari, the Court expressly directed the attention of council to the question of the time limit involved and asked that that question be briefed and it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.097" offset="12923800">But at no time has the Court ever had briefing an argument in these cases in which certiorari has been granted after the time that this is filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4736.850" offset="19050768">Mr. Justice, if I can get to that case soon enough, maybe I could exercise some prosecutorial discretion with respect to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.798" offset="19098520">This -- that seems to me to be a situation where discretion might be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.717" offset="19122239">In this case, where the prosecutor exercises the discretion otherwise and where two Courts below have sustained that, I found no effective way that I could proceed except by defending the actions which they have taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.099" offset="19211786">This Court in United States against Bernal, which involved a prosecution for impersonating an officer, a cognate question said that one of the purposes of such statute is to maintain the general good repute and dignity of the service itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.230" offset="19304260">And this is essentially an argument, which I made somewhat against the advise of some of my associates in the O'Brien case, where I contended that it was within the power of Congress under the necessary and proper clause in connection with the power given to raise and defend armies, to protect the dignity of the selective service process by making it a crime to burn draft cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.904" offset="19434977">I did that because I found it somewhat difficult myself to find that draft cards themselves were of very great importance in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.864" offset="19482833">The Court took the latter ground in its opinion and thus the O'Brien case is not a decision on that point but I think that the decision reads is very close to the one which is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.572" offset="19545631">So our position would be that the criminal code provision is constitutional and that the defendant clearly came within it and was properly found by the jury to have come within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.456" offset="19605191">And so we come to the exemption in 10 U. S. Code 772 (f) and our contention is that the petitioner was not by any reasonable stretch of the interpretation of the words in that statute an actor in a theatrical or motion picture production.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.008" offset="19703411">Now obviously, it wasn't motion picture so you can throw that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.739" offset="19718353">So you have to make him an actor in a theatrical production.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.020" offset="19743431">Now originally, this statute we spelled out the history of such as it is in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.804" offset="19766627">The statute prohibited any person from wearing the uniform in any playhouse or theater or in moving picture films.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.520" offset="19817409">And it was codified I think in 1954 and the sponsors emphasized that no substantive change was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.833" offset="19850742">The objective was to make it plain that television performances would be covered, which might not come within playhouse or theatre.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.010" offset="19903404">But the intention of Congress is manifested in the original language and in the revision and that is that it is confined to situations where the make believe role of the person wearing the uniform is clear from the setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.099" offset="19959724">Thus, it seems to me that Dr. Strangelove or the (Inaudible) mutiny come within it because everybody knows that's a simulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.880" offset="20002879">It doesn't mean that a performance must be given in the building, could be an outdoor theatre, could be an area set aside for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.668" offset="20038092">It means only that the performance wherever given must preserve some of the traditional characteristics of dramatic presentation such as the defined area set apart for the actors and an audience surprised that the events which they observed are portrayed and not real.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.672" offset="20114056">The skit here was not a theatrical production in any reasonable meaning of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.894" offset="20138924">It was an intermittent event in a demonstration in the street, in front of an induction station that also included picketing and distributing leaflets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.514" offset="20181452">Pedestrians and motorists who either stopped or passed by the demonstrating could reasonably believe that the petitioner was in fact a soldier as his wearing of distinctive parts of the uniform was intended to convey.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.900" offset="20238921">The petitioner's conduct here has all the elements of picketing and no real similarity to the theatrical production which Congress contemplated, and no one would suggest I believe that a person would be entitled without authority to wear the uniform of the army merely because he was picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.519" offset="20313422">To seek to bring the petitioner's action here within the statutory language is pressing that language to it's dryly logical extreme or to use of another passage from homes of being led by technical definition to apply a certain name and then to deduce consequences which have no relation to the grounds on which the name was applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="5103.405" offset="20516968">But the qualification on that exemption about tending to discredit the Armed Forces is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.519" offset="20545494">This is a little like for example, the Lopez case which involved the defense of entrapment and the contention was made that the charge about entrapment was not quite right and the Court held where it wasn't necessary to decide that because as a matter of law, there wasn't any entrapment and he wasn't entitled to any charge with respect to entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.491" offset="20633370">And we would contend here that the defendant was not entitled to any charge with respect to the defense of actor in a theatrical production and therefore the question of discredit becomes irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.117" offset="20691884">I would be prepared myself to defend a discredit exception to the exception to the statute if it was necessary although I agree that it's getting very close to the line but on grounds similar to those which were involved in the O'Brien case with respect to the draft cards.</text>
