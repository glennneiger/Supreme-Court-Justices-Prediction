            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="32.861" offset="234768">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court</text>
            <text syncTime="36.532" offset="249501">This is a criminal tax case brought here by direct appeal from the United States District Court of the District of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.890" offset="290983">I might say the outset that the United States brought the case here not because of the intrinsic importance of the case much less for the revenue involved but rather out of concern for the -- what seems to us only fairly characterized this judicial arbitrariness in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.129" offset="391920">Having said that I want to be very careful and detailed in stating the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.766" offset="426402">As I said, we're in the District of Utah before the Chief Judge, Judge Ritter.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.996" offset="459316">Information is filed against a man who's charged with having prepared income tax returns for others and having done so in a way so as to make those returns false and fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.187" offset="528071">Specifically, he invented or grossly exaggerated deductions to which the taxpayers were not entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.279" offset="572479">The case was called for trial on a certain day in August 1968 at which time a jury was selected and sworn, this was in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.311" offset="632665">In the afternoon, the United States attorney indicated that he wished to amend the 25-count information, reduce it down to 11 counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.685" offset="678118">At that point, the Judge Ritter indicated that if there was some doubt about need for bringing what he called a two-bit case, perhaps the Government wanted more time to have some more time with result in the dismissal of the remaining counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.823" offset="770696">I find out that this itself would have resulted in a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.627" offset="789922">The jury had and already been sworn if the Government had been allowed more time in which to consider whether it wish to dismiss this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.715" offset="834226">The Government indicated that it was ready, the defense had no suggestion to make understandably and so the case proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.181" offset="884067">The first witness was an internal revenue official who was called simply to identify the returns which were the subject of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.069" offset="931610">It was immediately stipulated that these were authentic returns and the witness therefore all was immediately removed from the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.490" offset="973302">Thereupon, the first real witness was called by the prosecution who was one of the taxpayers, that is one of those for whom a return had been prepared by the defendant Mr. Jorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.376" offset="1024920">As soon as the taxpayer took the stand, defense counsel, and this appears at page 40 of the very short record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.723" offset="1074239">Mr. Morrill, defense counsel addresses the Court as follows, “In view of the transcript in the preliminary hearing in this matter, it is my feeling that each of these taxpayers should be warned as to his constitutional rights before testifying because I feel there is a possibility of the violation of the law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="267.227" offset="1172250">The judge responded, “Well we wouldn't want anybody to talk himself into a federal penitentiary here, so what the Court has to say to you is this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="279.210" offset="1220211">And I would not read the following two pages in which the judge quite clearly, emphatically, in the strongest possible terms, advices the prospective witnesses of their right not to testify for fear of incriminating themselves of their right to have a lawyer, of their right to have a lawyer appointed for them even though they are not criminal defendants before they testify and then he addresses the witness and says, this in now on page 41, “Well what do you want to do?”</text>
            <text syncTime="314.884" offset="1362944">The witness responds, “Your Honor, my wife and I have had it pointed out to us that our returns have information in them that we know is wrong and we have admitted this and I would admit it further in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.205" offset="1424175">The judge responds, “Have you talked to a lawyer?”</text>
            <text syncTime="333.317" offset="1436609">Witness says, “No sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="335.800" offset="1446536">The court says, “I am not going to let you admitted any further in this Court, that is all there is about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.537" offset="1477569">The admissions you've already made were very likely obtained from you without telling you what your constitutional rights are.”</text>
            <text syncTime="350.661" offset="1505991">The witness says, “No sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="352.815" offset="1514663">The court says, “What is that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="354.639" offset="1521977">The witness says, “We were advised at the time we were first contacted by the internal revenue service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="362.353" offset="1552802">The judge responds, “If you were, you are the only taxpayer in the United States that has been so advised because they do not do that when they first contact you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="373.261" offset="1596374">And the judge then explains his version of how a revenue service goes about incriminating prospective defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.301" offset="1636603">The judge addresses --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="384.778" offset="1642454">May I ask, Mr. Claiborne, were other potential witnesses present in the courtroom at this time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="392.971" stopTime="480.475">
            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="392.971" offset="1675264">No Mr. Chief Justice, there had been a separation of witnesses the other of respective taxpayers had been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.349" offset="1704730">They later were returned to the courtroom and addressed by the judge with respect to their rights also but by that time the judge had already indicated his disposition to avoid the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.415" offset="1765021">The judge excuses the witness at this point, turns to the US attorney and says “Are all your witnesses in this shape?”</text>
            <text syncTime="426.778" offset="1810474">The US attorney replies, “Your Honor, by the time any of these witnesses were contacted, there was a criminal investigation, not of the witnesses but of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.629" offset="1853837">It is true that the Internal Revenue Service does not require this warning until after first meeting with a special agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.713" offset="1882258">But it is the practice in this office, they do give this warning, it is not required but they do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="453.066" offset="1915591">The judge then expresses some doubt as to whether the warning could have been sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.521" offset="1945475">There is more colloquy between the Court and the United States attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.025" offset="1967522">We're now on page 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.566" offset="1981628">The judge once again expresses his view that this case never should have been brought because of the trivial amounts involved.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="482.222" offset="2032306">They were originally Mr. Justice Black 25 counts showing exaggerated or invented deductions in amounts ranging from, I think, for each taxpayer, totals somewhere between two and three, or $400.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.037" offset="2119555">Eventually, 14 of those counts were removed but for all we know Mr. Jorn had been involved in this occupation for some time and was expectedly to have much larger number of taxpayers.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="519.442" offset="2181099">Was Mr. Jorn a professional tax adviser or consultant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="523.135" stopTime="651.867">
            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="523.135" offset="2195937">It appears from colloquy at the beginning of the trial between the judge, and I think, defense counsel that Mr. Jorn was not a professional accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.122" offset="2235852">That he at this point was no longer in this tax service but that he had some accounting training and judging from this particular information which recites several tax years with respect to each of the taxpayers, he had been engaged in it at least for three years because we have three different years for several of the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.969" offset="2327280">We just don't know how large an operation it was, it does appear that the taxpayers involved were of modest income.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.092" offset="2371688">On page 43 of the record, the Court finally ends the colloquies with the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.705" offset="2402200">Well, I will tell you what is going to happen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.334" offset="2420694">Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be necessary for you to attend the court any further on this matter at this point, with this charges jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.339" offset="2464684">The judge then requires all the taxpayers including the witnesses who had been excluded under the rule to return to the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.687" offset="2502092">We're now on page 44 of the record and he once again and for the better part of three pages advises them with respect to their right to remain silent, their right not to testify, his decision not to allow the trial to proceed until such time that he personally has had a further opportunity to suggest to them the unwisdom of putting themselves in danger of self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.965" offset="2623195">And finally the judge says, “So, this case is vacated, setting is vacated this afternoon and it will be calendared again.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.765" offset="2662484">And before it is calendared again I am going to have this witnesses in and talk to them before, I will talk to them again before I will permit them to testify.”</text>

            <text syncTime="657.373" offset="2732910">Serving a case for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.672" offset="2750046">On basis of the facts I've just recited, it seems to our certain propositions of not subject to controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.437" offset="2793096">The first is, that the Government here, the United States attorney was in no way at fault, no way guilty of misconduct, in no way responsible for the ending, premature ending of this trial or for declaration of a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.956" offset="2883166">It is also true that no conduct of defense made this course inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.389" offset="2920887">However, as I pointed out in the statement of facts, it was at the instance of defense counsel that the judge proceeded to interrogate the witnesses and ultimately to declare a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.761" offset="2982431">It was the suggestion of defense counsel that provoked the ultimate action declaring a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.414" offset="3013047">Now, it maybe that defense counsel had in mind simply that the judge would admonish the taxpayers with respect to their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.286" offset="3044498">No doubt, defense counsel hoped that such advise from the judge might change the minds of some of the witnesses with respect to their willingness to testify or their decision thus, for not to invoke the Fifth Amendment or it may be that defense counsel anticipated what in fact did happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.763" offset="3138435">We're in no position to guess about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.410" offset="3161004">In so far as the mistrial is the consequence of a defense motion, the case is so clearly governed by prior cases of this Court that I need not dwell on that aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.746" offset="3226311">I am willing to argue however on the alternative basis that the defense is not to be held accountable for the judge's arbitrary action in prematurely ending the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.553" offset="3285556">And on for that purpose it seems to us we can assimilate this case in every respect with Gori versus United States cited by this Court some few terms ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.484" offset="3341354">They also adjudged in what this could characterized as exaggerated or perhaps exaggerated solicitude for the defendant without any motion from the defense ordered a mistrial and the question was whether the defendant could be retried subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.860" offset="3422856">The Court held that he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.197" offset="3448142">That decision as well as, or prior decisions of this Court on the ‘70 have indicated that the Double Jeopardy Clause really does not control this question in any direct sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.707" offset="3514180">Double Jeopardy Clause is directly, and as this Court has construed it, deals more immediately with the problem of a case which has gone to verdict, whether a verdict of acquittal or a verdict of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.570" offset="3581680">A mistrial, which is of course neither barred re-prosecution only in circumstances where either and I think this is, this court's decision in Downum where to allow a retrial would be to get around the double jeopardy ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.520" offset="3677497">In this sense, if the defendant stood a good chance of winning an acquittal which would have barred his retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.969" offset="3719293">He must not be cheated of that right to obtain an acquittal by action, unjustified action made at the door of the prosecution because the Government thinks its case is going badly and in that sense, --</text>

            <text syncTime="936.449" offset="3849174">We put it in terms of whether the action of the Court was taken on behalf of the Government, whether its affect was to harass the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.712" offset="3902255">We recognize that it may be a part of the right to trial by jury though aside from the double jeopardy clause to have a case brought to a conclusion before the jury first in panel but --</text>

            <text syncTime="976.905" offset="4011029">And precisely that example, an example which indicates not a motion of the defendant, not a waiver by the defendant indicates that there is no absolute bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.593" offset="4057736">Mr. Justice Washington very early on said, Double Jeopardy Clause obviously doesn't control this situation of a mistrial because the Double Jeopardy Clause has no exceptions in it and we had no right to read exceptions into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.997" offset="4119385">Therefore, this is a case not governed by the Double Jeopardy Clause since everyone concedes that in the case of a hung jury, for instance, there must be a right in the public in the prosecution to retry even though no argument of waiver by the defense could possibly be advanced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.428" offset="4277060">It could Mr. Chief Justice, it does seem to us that the early termination of this trial after it have only technically began has a bearing on the extent to which the defendant was harassed by, or would be harassed by, a new prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.454" offset="4357204">He has not undergone, he has not gone through the gauntlet in any real sense at the point when this trial was aborted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.336" offset="4392730">And since this is a matter not governed by absolute rules, whose considerations it seems to us ought to be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.684" offset="4442154">I may say that at this, of this invokes the decision of this Court in Tateo versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.982" offset="4487293">It seems to us also relevant that in the case of a trial which does go to a conclusion but which is reversed on appeal, reversed on appeal often for grounds which amount to characterizing the first trial as a mistrial, an erroneous trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.102" offset="4563780">A trial in many instances where the judge should have halted it before it went today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.140" offset="4591888">That situation and this one ought not be so radically distinguished and yet in every case where a trial which is reversed on appeal allows a retrial even where the new trial, the first trial was reversed for lack of sufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.052" offset="4695542">This Court has specifically so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.312" offset="4716648">And why the result should be so different because the judge interposed himself early rather than an appellate court is not easy to appreciate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.179" offset="4760116">The difference cannot be that it is the defendant who is moving for a new trial in the case of an appeal because that would be an instance in which a defendant was required in order to observe one constitutional right, constitutional right to reverse so long for constitutional error to waive a supposed other constitutional right, the right not to be retried, that is the right created in Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.015" offset="4887385">It follows from this that it is not the defendant's motion that makes a new trial permissible in the case of the trial which is not the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.747" offset="4922389">It must be a balancing of interest which the double jeopardy clause does not deal with and the defendant's motion and any notion of waiver is quite irrelevant to the rule permitting this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.104" offset="4987800">For these several reasons, we suggest that the judgment below ought to be reversed and that the prosecution be free to proceed with a new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.547" offset="5077556">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.323" offset="5092707">I believe the counsel for the Government has adequately stated the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.171" offset="5116008">I would amplify on this -- in certain instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.277" offset="5140459">First, I believe it should be pointed out that a peculiar relationship existed in this case between the defendant and the taxpayer witnesses called to testify against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.560" offset="5197615">Defendant was accused in the information of aiding and assisting in procuring and counseling and advising in the preparation of false and fraudulent tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.322" offset="5244635">The returns involved are the returns of the very witnesses who were testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.066" offset="5275669">The Internal Revenue Service had determined that these returns were erroneous, were fraudulent in their view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.138" offset="5319973">Therefore, if defendant was not guilty of the fraud, then the taxpayers may well have been guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.372" offset="5372844">From the preliminary hearing in the matter, I, being defense counsel at that time, it was my feeling that some of these witnesses were trying to blame their errors upon the defendant and thus escape prosecution from the Internal Revenue Service.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1337.926" offset="5455078">Now counsel, unless there is something in the record to reflect that, it's better to confine yourself to what's in the record, not your private views of the matter.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="denis_r_morrill" startTime="1345.319" stopTime="1596.392">
            <label>Mr. Denis R. Morrill</label>
            <text syncTime="1345.319" offset="5484648">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.080" offset="5495724">For this, based upon the relationship between the taxpayers and the defendant in this case, one facet of the defense prepared was to show that these people had given the information to defendant from which he prepared their returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.159" offset="5628008">In other words, the defendant wished to convey to the jury that these witnesses were trying to, in essence blame him for their mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.027" offset="5679522">It was for this reason that counsel pointed out to the court that he felt these witnesses should be warned of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.691" offset="5730095">This was certainly not tantamount to any motion for a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.293" offset="5760502">After this warning was given as stated by counsel for the Government, the jury was summarily dismissed with no opportunity on either side for objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.120" offset="5827897">From the law, as stated by this Court, it appears to me that once a jury in impaneled to try a criminal case, it may only be dismissed by the Court in rare and extraordinary circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.874" offset="5914833">The task which has been verbalized is often referred to as a manifest and necessity test wherein the jury is to be discharged only if there is a manifest and necessity in doing so in order to preserve substantial justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.281" offset="6000515">The cases of this Court have held that the discretion of a trial court in granting a mistrial while not closely scrutinized certainly is not unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.189" offset="6080136">I believe that the instant case shows no extraordinary circumstance nor any manifest necessity for granting a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.540" offset="6129560">The trial court, after warning these witnesses, concluded that he would not allow them to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.549" offset="6177520">Whether this is a legally defensible conclusion, I believe at this point is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.199" offset="6224123">After so concluding, the trial court took a further step which should be distinguished I believe from the first that is he dismissed the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.382" offset="6276890">Certainly the second step did not follow from the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.807" offset="6302595">Trial court had several discretionary alternatives which he could have followed, if he in fact felt these witnesses should have a more explicit warning than he had given them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.667" offset="6354004">He could have recessed the Court overnight which would have given ample opportunity for the accomplishment of his purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.658" offset="6394023">He could have called counsel to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.021" offset="6403427">There are counsel available close which he could have requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.443" offset="6437177">He did not do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.706" offset="6446164">He dismissed the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.201" offset="6456195">I believe the alternative which he chose clearly was not dictated by any manifest necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.392" offset="6488900">You think, I gather from your argument, the logic of your argument is that the more wrong that the district judge was, the more erroneous was his action in dismissing the jury, the stronger your case is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.921" offset="6555042">In other words, if there was an absolute necessity for a mistrial that any rational competent judge would not have no choice but declare, but to declare a mistrial because it is only that or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.847" offset="6606764">I gather that you concede that there could then be a new trial, a new prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.797" offset="6630588">But if on the other hand, there was no such necessity, no such absolute necessity and the trial judge irrationally or erroneously declare a mistrial then there cannot be a new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.966" offset="6691192">That would be the logic of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.429" offset="6701119">That has been stated by one of the members of this Court that the risk of judicial arbitrariness should not be placed upon the defendant but rather should be placed upon the Government in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.673" offset="6770082">Then too, I believe the position of the trial court in this case is rather unique and that the same Court that granted this mistrial or discharged the jury, some five months later, on reviewing his own exercise of discretion granted defendant's motion to dismiss based upon the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.674" offset="6874049">Would appear to me that this judge was in excellent position to review his own exercise of discretion and that in granting this motion, he concluded that in his prior action he had abused his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.898" offset="6938937">Abuse of this discretion, prejudiced the defendant and for this reason the action in dismissing the information should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.078" offset="6999646">This Court has also held in Downum versus United States that a mistrial declared in the aid of prosecution would prevent retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.105" offset="7055757">Upon separating the action of the trial judge into two parts, the first, his opinion or conclusion that this witnesses could not testify and second, the dismissing of the jury, it appears to me that the defendant was prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.918" offset="7151052">After concluding that the witnesses could not testify, had the Court continued the trial, there's no question of what a verdict of acquittal would have been forthcoming since these were all of the Government's witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.327" offset="7216671">In both the Gori case and the Tateo case relied upon by the Government, retrial was allowed after a mistrial in the one case, after conviction in the other, both times to protect the rights of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.683" offset="7290128">This Court, I believe, will rather heavily unmet argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.642" offset="7309981">The rights of the accused were being protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.295" offset="7324505">In the instant case, the dismissal of the jury clearly was not for the protection of Mr. Jorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.102" offset="7359822">Any possible beneficiaries of this action were the witnesses and of course the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1968.963" offset="7979238">It seems to us that the doubts of considerations here requires that in the case where a judge, as this judge you must conclude has, arbitrarily and without the need for doing so, declares a mistrial but not at the instance of the Government, not for the advantage of the Government that the provisions of the Double Jeopardy Clause do not prevent retrial of the defendant.</text>
