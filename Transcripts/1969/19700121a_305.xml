            <text syncTime="255.412" offset="1125021">Well, that's a separate question, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.771" offset="1134425">It certainly is related and that's why I mentioned it at this point, but I'm simply addressing myself now to the assertion made by the government that religion does not mean conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.317" offset="1184684">And I think that's clearly wrong from the standpoint of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.999" offset="1199417">I can understand the government's inclination so to construe the protection of religion in the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.574" offset="1229720">I understand why they would like to limit it, but it's just flatly inaccurate as a matter of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.838" offset="1250722">That's just not what they understood 180 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.807" offset="1266604">What we're calling for is not something which would destroy orderly government at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.769" offset="1286457">Obviously, what would be most destructive of orderly government would be if the constitution were ignored, and we want the constitution enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.527" offset="1325432">That is, the constitution says certain things about what powers Congress have, and I will come very quickly to that central question.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.746" offset="1362317">That is, what power did Congress receive through the constitution to draft individuals, whether in peace or in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.151" offset="1404008">That's the central issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.045" offset="1407561">Obviously, if the constitution did not delegate this power to Congress, Congress doesn't have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.315" offset="1428668">Even if Congress would like to have it, even if Congress thinks that it is absolutely indispensable in its judgment to have that power, if that power was not conferred by the constitution, it's perfectly plain they don't have the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.930" offset="1479137">The constitution sets the limits of the power that were in fact conferred to Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.478" offset="1501288">So it's your idea that anything –- anytime a man believes its wrong to go to war, it couldn't be conscripted that was almost necessary to do away with conscription, wouldn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1999.122" offset="8099819">The argument was well, are you going to take farmers and post them on garrison posts on the frontiers to combat the unions?</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.759" offset="8130435">We need an army, a standing army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.592" offset="8137749">Now, what did that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.304" offset="8144541">The very first Congress enacted a bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.438" offset="8153109">I had as a matter of fact, starting by 1789, 1790, 1791, 1792, 1793, 1794, 1795, there are separate bills, numerous, dealing with the army, the standing army, as well as with militia but in quite separate ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.969" offset="8211205">And the standing army that was provided consisted of I think 1,200 men, meant to deal very expressly with the problem of the frontiers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2051.340" offset="8308694">In any event, I really don't think I should spend more time on this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.219" offset="8336280">I would like to mention another separate argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.498" offset="8349341">That is, I simply mentioned that in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.443" offset="8361148">That is that if a non-volunteer army is feasible, Congress just can't pick and choose ways of raising men and say, “Well, we're not going to spend the money so that we'll have this money available for the project.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.922" offset="8427081">That is, if they can raise volunteers, they're required to raise volunteers for the standing army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.426" offset="8449128">That was the original concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.344" offset="8456756">As a matter of fact, the concept -– the word “raise armies” is used repeatedly by the first congress, by the early Congresses, and they specified that they mean volunteers and the deal with militia entirely separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.048" offset="8511613">As a matter of fact in one case, they increased the size of the authorized army I think to 5,000 men, and they said, “But we want to make it clear that as soon as the emergency is over, that army is to be disbanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.725" offset="8562291">We don't want it around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.700" offset="8566157">We want that number reduced to 1,500.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.889" offset="8578905">And so now, I won't even touch on the argument that the power of Congress is further limited so that it can't raise an army for an illegal war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.652" offset="8633971">Now, that's dealt within our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.519" offset="8645465">I think it's much too complex to even begin at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.568" offset="8657690">I would, if I may, like to turn for the remaining time to the solicitor's argument with respect to the establishment issue, as well as the free exercise issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.459" offset="8713174">Incidentally, Mr. Justice Marshall, I checked in to various authorities on the question bearing on whether we have an rest of judgment decision more in a -– well, another authority, I'm very bad on issues, right, it simply don't communicate if there's anything to be done after you grant the motion of rest of judgment, you grant it and that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.824" offset="8822680">And I checked the records in this Court in the cases of Bramblett as well as the case of Green, they are cited at page 15 of our brief, and I looked at the order entered by the lower courts in those cases and that's all they say, motion to rest of judgment granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.577" offset="8901674">I found no indication that there's anything else which anyone else thought needed to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.798" offset="8922572">On the establishment question simply indicate that on the basis of the Solicitor General's argument, it's perfectly clear that the act tends to establish pacifist religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.092" offset="8979728">That's what the Act has intended -– well, it isn't intended to establish them but it is intended to protect members of pacifist religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.768" offset="9018493">Now, the Solicitor General says, “That's alright, that's alright because religion doesn't mean what we say it means within the First Amendment,” and that's because the First Amendment somehow can't be used in this way to limit the power of Congress to raise and support armies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.313" offset="9088606">I think that -– that logically it falls from everything I've said up to now, that that just isn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.812" offset="9114624">Historically, that is completely inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.776" offset="9130506">Now, on the free exercise of religion argument, there's an important misconception that must be dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.551" offset="9185573">We're not dealing here with a non-religious objector, I mentioned that yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.875" offset="9214830">This man is a non-religious in the statutory sense, conscientious objector.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.329" offset="9276688">Now, that's correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.935" offset="9287137">Now, the question is not whether he can pick and choose his war but whether religions, including established religions, recognize the concept of just war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.382" offset="9356936">I don't think there's any question about the fact that today at least, Protestant, Catholic, Jewish organizations, the Vatican Council, all have made it perfectly plain that they think that there are differences between wars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.266" offset="9428407">Some wars are okay and some aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.648" offset="9441991">That is, as religious organizations, it just doesn't seem to me that the argument can be made that if a man objects to a particular war, he necessarily has a “political” objection as opposed to a religious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.024" offset="9499460">That just doesn't square with the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.287" offset="9512521">Again, I think that whether you reach this conclusion or not depends on your concept of the power of Congress to raise and support armies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.774" offset="9558497">If you conceive of it as being completely uncontrollable, then it might make sense to apply much more restrictive notion of what is meant by religion in the First Amendment insofar as it relates to the power of Congress to raise and support armies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.245" offset="9628400">But I just don't think there's any support, any historical support with the view that Congress in 1789 could simply reach out and say, “I'm going to take you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.443" offset="9677093">I know its peace time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.459" offset="9681168">I know we don't have any wars, but we've got -– we've got to have a strong army.” Just absolutely no support for that view.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.014" offset="12603434">Well, Mr. Justice, I would think that if you concluded that you had no jurisdiction, the case had never left the District Court, and you would not have power to send it back with any directions or instructions of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.936" offset="12659127">There is a suggestion here in the argument today that Sisson's objection was not a selective one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.433" offset="12697057">On that, I would simply refer to page 151 of the appendix, Sisson's testimony which the government accepts as part of the agreed statement of facts here, “I refused induction because I believe the war in Vietnam, that is the United States war making in Vietnam, to be wrong.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.246" offset="12784306">He then went on to say, “That therefore, I felt that by accepting induction that even though I might not be sent to Vietnam, I would be consenting to the government's waging a war in Vietnam and I believe that my duty not to consent with that action because I did not consent in my own mind.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.782" offset="12866539">With respect to the power of Congress to impose a peace time military service, I was fortunate enough to go off in a country which did not have conscription, and I suppose I regarded that as something which would last for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.858" offset="12942817">It would be fine if we could get to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.716" offset="12962252">I would point out though that Congress enacted the modern conscription laws in 1940, which was technically a time of peace, actually a time of peace in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.745" offset="13014392">That the problem of reenacting that statute in 1941 also came up in a time of peace in this country, and it would be rather surprising if it should now be held that Congress had no power to pass those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.826" offset="13098715">Let me conclude by simply saying that our professional historian friends are rather skeptical of lawyer's history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.827" offset="13162663">They refer to it as law office history and regarded as –- to use an appropriate word, as highly selective. C.V. Wedgwood, the noted historian, wrote one time, “We know the end before we consider the beginning and we can never wholly recapture what it was to know the beginning only.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.576" offset="13281677">And our submission here is that the Court should not find in history something that surely was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.654" offset="13318040">Our predecessors were sensitive to the First Amendment, but the founders accepted the exemption from military service for members of the peace churches without any question, and this was accepted explicitly in the Acts of Congress for 130 years right through the First World War.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.763" offset="13418454">It would be odd indeed if the invalidity of this unbroken practice was now discovered for the first time a 180 years after the adoption of the Bill of Rights.</text>
