            <label>Mr. Richard T. Farrell</label>
            <text syncTime="19.052" offset="179597">Your Honors, this case comes to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.112" offset="187852">The writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the State New York which Court held that certain police activity founded upon less than probable cause, do not constitute a violation of the defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment and did not in fact the confessions yielded by the defendant after he resist as we contend in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.629" offset="289938">The facts in this case are fairly simply set forth early in the morning of October 4, 1964 in Bronx County, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.284" offset="324524">Mrs. Adi Brown died of multiple stab wounds, 31 to exact, and looked upon her by at that time an unknown assailant in elevator in a 21-storey-apartment house in a public housing project in the South Bronx.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.363" offset="384815">Police efforts at the scene at that time on October 4th yielded no leads.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.865" offset="410833">But on October 5, 1964, Detective Aubrey Ferguson was walking on the vicinity of the scene of the crime and met Mrs. Rebecca Morales who is the mother of the petitioner here Melvin Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.991" offset="467362">Detective Ferguson knew the Morales family but knew them at a different address.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.325" offset="484707">He asked Mrs. Morales, “What are you doing here?”</text>
            <text syncTime="97.702" offset="494216">She said, “Oh, I live there," pointing to the building in which the crime had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.100" offset="515741">The police also, sometime after October 5th, had information from a young man who testified on the trial that he had been outside the premises where the crime was committed had seen someone outside the building at the pertinent time.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="119.438" offset="581151">Could that be the very young boy?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard T. Farrell</label>
            <text syncTime="121.642" offset="589928">Yes, that's Everett Roberts, Mr. Justice Stewart whose testimony, the District Attorney abandoned in the submission by the time, it's very unusual, we try this case in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.951" offset="635173">They finished cross-examining this young fellow.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.057" offset="643636">Here, the crime being committed sometime in October or November or December of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.115" offset="663803">And I doubt very much if he could've given a description much better than that available by looking at page 1320 of the record of Morales as a skinny Puerto Rican which is a fairly active description of a great number of people in the South Bronx.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.321" offset="724616">But on October 11th, the police, to quote again from the testimony of Detective Ferguson about page 742 in the record said, “We rounded up some of the neighborhood narcotics addicts, and probably did do to about October 11, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.029" offset="787519">The police officers came to the conclusion that Morales who did not live in the building with his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.086" offset="811760">They found that he was an inhibitory of the neighborhood not seen around by who we don't know exactly but it appears where these narcotics addicts have all rounded up on the 11th.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.380" offset="852929">And the police then concentrated the records on trying to find Melvin Morales to talk to.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.640" offset="873932">The principal thrust to their evidence was to contact his mother, Mrs. Morales, Rebecca Morales, telling her that they were interested in speaking to Melvin.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.445" offset="909145">Now, if instead of this phrase that you said the detective used to describe their process of getting this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.464" offset="941223">If instead of that, a dozen detectives or 24 detectives had walk up and down the street talking to every narcotic addict and the others of that world and got the same information.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.565" offset="1001618">Would you say, that the case is different or the same?</text>

            <text syncTime="248.556" offset="1097644">Mr. Chief Justice, on October 13th, approximately nine days after the event that led to the homicide investigation of the murder and about three days after the police started to concentrate to the evidence on finding Melvin Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.207" offset="1168175">The police officers followed Mrs. Morales from her home to her place of business and stayed at her beauty parlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.980" offset="1195342">About her four o'clock in the afternoon, Mrs. Morales was visited by one of the officers, I believe it was Detective Carol who asked her, “Well, do you think your son will be around?”</text>
            <text syncTime="282.020" offset="1231496">She said, “Well, I think he will be up this afternoon.”</text>
            <text syncTime="284.391" offset="1240900">As a matter of fact, the testimony in the record by Mrs. Morales indicates very clearly that she had informed Melvin Morales that the police were interested in speaking to him and Morales seems to have said, “That's alright mother, I will come up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="298.476" offset="1297324">At eight o' clock that evening, on October 13th, Melvin Morales did in fact come up to his mother's beauty parlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.732" offset="1326268">He arrived in a taxi cab, stepped out of the cab.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.922" offset="1339016">Detective Carol took Morales, put him in Detective Downe's car, Detective Downe went to see Mrs. Morales and set him words were in substance, “Come on outside, we have your son.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.686" offset="1378095">Please, pay the taxi cab.”</text>
            <text syncTime="320.830" offset="1386663">Mrs. Morales, “May I talk to him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="322.034" offset="1391470">The detective, “No, that isn't necessary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="324.715" offset="1402232">As the people was stating the facts in the respondent's brief points out, the officer did interfere with her access to her son.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.708" offset="1430235">The police officers then took him in the detective's car, down to 42nd precinct, brought him upstairs in the station house, put him in the Lieutenant's office, and commenced the process of interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.733" offset="1482271">Downe made some reference to the following rights of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.207" offset="1500244">He said you can have a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.468" offset="1505259">You don't have to talk to us and anything you say to us may be used against you.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.427" offset="1521037">Morales declined to speak to Downe at that point, said, “I'd rather speak to Detective Carol.”</text>
            <text syncTime="358.591" offset="1537755">Detective Carol returned from his brief departure to get coffee and cake.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.447" offset="1553115">The first words out of Morales' mouth in words were in substance were, “Carol, you know, I can't take a beating.”</text>
            <text syncTime="370.810" offset="1586657">Carol replied to that, “Stop building offenses, stop making alibis, stop building threats to him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="375.445" offset="1605151">Lean on, there's one thing you can't do?</text>
            <text syncTime="377.306" offset="1612570">You can't lie to God.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.795" offset="1622601">Morales, “Yes I do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="381.939" offset="1631169">“Between you and your God, did you do this thing?”</text>

            <text syncTime="446.284" offset="1888528">Carol then repeated to Morales substantially the same warnings given to him by Detective Duff earlier and Morales made a full-blown verbal confession that he had needed narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.457" offset="1933249">He had been in his mother's apartment and got outside for breath of air.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.041" offset="1991555">At that point, Detective Downe return to the interrogation site and Downe and Carol made essentially this observation to Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.800" offset="2034604">Now, since you and Morales are going to have to repeat you a story to detective of a homicide squad carrying this case, precinct detective who's in charge with a responsibility in this case and perhaps to the District Attorney in another unspecified list of police officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.471" offset="2117256">Morales complied and that led to the second confession in this case or polygraphic statement completed about 9:05 on October 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.653" offset="2149961">Thereafter, and true enough to the police officer's words, there was a further procession of police officers interrogating Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.316" offset="2172635">They substantially reiterated his confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.428" offset="2185070">Later on in the evening, an Assistant District Attorney for Bronx County's Office arrive on the scene, conducted a question and answer session with Morales, with the aid of a stenotype recorder and then after that session was completed sometime early on the morning of October 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.580" offset="2245674">Now, about four-and-a-half to five hours after the initial taking into custody, Morales was taken to the scene of the crime where he reenacted the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.870" offset="2282872">At four o'clock in the morning of October 14th, he was in the emergency ward of Morrisania Hospital being treated for what appeared to be narcotics withdrawal symptoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.230" offset="2324250">A week later, around October 20, police officers visited Morales in Bronx House of Detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.209" offset="2348178">They said they wanted to talk to him and according to the police officers' own testimony, at that point, Morales had formed the new resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.952" offset="2371166">He said, “No, I will not talk to you, I am going to fight this thing,” meaning, obviously the charge of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.591" offset="2401782">Morales was duly tried and convicted in the Bronx County.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.411" offset="2417037">Preliminary hearing in the question of voluntariness of his confession the famous Huntley hearing in New York mandated by this Court's decision in Jackson versus Denno was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.426" offset="2449115">Morales did not testify at the Huntley hearing, the trial judge found his confession voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.760" offset="2474402">Jury was charged on a question of voluntariness, the jury convicted, Morales who received a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.840" offset="2502719">The appellate division of the Police Department in New York affirmed unanimously without an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.510" offset="2525393">The Court of Appeals in the State of New York affirmed again unanimously but this time, with an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.960" offset="2555173">This Court since we granted certiorari in this case on April 21, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.773" offset="2578474">Your Honors, at the time the police officers picked up Melvin Morales, they knew the following concrete specific information about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.489" offset="2621315">His mother lived in a building where the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.940" offset="2635107">He was a narcotic's addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.646" offset="2645974">He, they have been told, had not been seen around since the time the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.525" offset="2673455">And that Your Honors is about all they knew about Melvin Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.383" offset="2692890">Armed with this scanty information, the police officers formed a very obvious intention of making Morales into their custody and bringing him down to the station house for interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.205" offset="2732178">The Court of Appeals of the State of New York said in its opinion that, it may be conceded that there was not probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.535" offset="2769481">They did not make a finding on the question whether there was a probable cause and I submit on the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.810" offset="2790588">And especially in the light of the testimony the two officers who picked Morales up in the first place, when saying, “Well, I have nothing definitely to tie him to the crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="679.128" offset="2819845">And the others saying, “I was dubious about his connection with the crime”, and it wasn't until the interrogation brought out what it brought out that he was convinced he was guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.493" offset="2849311">It's quite obviously no probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.996" offset="2859342">Further, the Court of Appeals did however seem to make the finding, a finding which I submit is probably binding on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.350" offset="2884733">The Court of Appeals said at page 58 of its opinion at 22 New York Second, the record does not support a finding that defendant consented to his detention and question.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.677" offset="2938128">It says the Court of Appeals in fact there was no consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.721" offset="2950248">In fact there was no probable cause, it does not necessarily make this issue here unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.308" offset="2968639">We must examine to see under all the circumstances whether if this issue here it was reasonable or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.795" offset="2998523">The Court of Appeals of course is writing in May of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.186" offset="3012106">They are writing without the benefit of the elimination supplied by this Court in the case of Davis versus Mississippi, decided on April 22nd, the day after this Court granted certiorari in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.298" offset="3064560">Davis versus Mississippi, Your Honors, I think makes it painfully clear that if the police do not possess probable cause, do not have a warrant, they cannot take a citizen off the street and bring him to the station house.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.002" offset="3135404">The only thing they can do is footnote six in the Davis opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.420" offset="3153063">It reminds the country, the only thing they can do is request the voluntary cooperation of the citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.484" offset="3181275">Morales was not requested to voluntarily cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.830" offset="3198725">He was grabbed by one police officer, thrust into the other officer's car, and take him down to the station house.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.372" offset="3224848">The Court of Appeals makes the almost chronicle observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.205" offset="3244178">The defendant testified he was so loosely guarded when taken from the car to the station that he could have safely escaped.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.056" offset="3271555">Well, I don't know about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.139" offset="3279914">All he said in his testimony, at page 9 to 15 in the record is that the police officers didn't hold them by each arm.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.325" offset="3320665">But the Court of Appeals own but this was a reasonable seizure within the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.525" offset="3341458">No probable cause and therefore caused no arrest, couldn't be an arrest, there was no basis to link this man to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.018" offset="3367476">No consent to the Court of Appeals here but the question is, “Was it reasonable to do what the police officers did?”</text>
            <text syncTime="821.464" offset="3389210">And then marching through their consideration of what constituted reasonableness, the Court of Appeals is that there's no practical alternative of taking the man off the street and dragging him down to the station house.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.788" offset="3426513">The police station is a better place to interrogate defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.952" offset="3447202">We iterate on oral argument and they say in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.950" offset="3455143">That's exactly what this Court I think decided Miranda versus Arizona because the police station is such a dandy place to interrogate suspects.</text>

            <text syncTime="926.054" offset="3807587">But that question I think is referable to the proper procedure under the New York practice, since the question has been properly preserved for review by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="953.721" offset="3918242">Because those two arresting officers had nothing even remotely approaching in their view of probable cause to make the seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1045.516" offset="4285419">But it's the reason why they were looking for Melvin Morales, that makes the seizure here unreasonable within the ambit of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.305" offset="4320632">They were not operating on anything that remotely approaching probable cause for his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.422" offset="4341112">They had nothing but a bare suspicion that he might have something to tell them about the crime since of course, his family lived in the building.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.303" offset="4376534">This hardly, intellectively points the finger of suspicion at Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.333" offset="4396701">The Court of Appeals have to checkerboard square of investigation pointed only to Morales but at most, to give the people their due, four out of those 64 squares on any checkerboard were filled in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.467" offset="4441213">That hardly, I think mounts up to a kind of justification for a seizure and detention of a citizen as into this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.729" offset="4486248">To say that, since Morales knew the police was looking for him that he is coming to his mother's beauty parlor, may be read as a surrender flies in the face of both the determination by New York Court of Appeals, that there was nothing in this record to support a consent of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.281" offset="4556466">And there's also tantamount in my opinion to saying that a lamb that goes to the pasture and surrenders himself to the wolf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.943" offset="4583111">Morales wanted to surrender to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.764" offset="4590425">There are better places to surrender to the police than your mother's beauty parlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.174" offset="4604113">There are police stations, many of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.829" offset="4614666">But Morales, I don't think can be said to have surrendered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.516" offset="4629400">I think the Court of Appeals has decided that question that there was no surrender, no consent to interrogation at that place under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.770" offset="4666493">And since that is a determination, I believe on the question of fact by the highest Court in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.442" offset="4689168">I do not think that that question of fact is reviewable by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.043" offset="4707558">But if the Court be convinced that there was a violation of the Fourth Amendment, it becomes another more pressing problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.494" offset="4741308">If the Fourth Amendment was violated, what affect does should that have on the use of Morales' confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.175" offset="4776103">Taking my lead from the American Law Institutes modal code of pre-arraignment procedures especially Article IX of that document and from Wong Sun versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.274" offset="4828453">I believe that the answer to that question is once the confessions are taken so close, at least the point of time, to an unreasonable seizure within the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.236" offset="4872338">Those confessions must be barred from evidence without reference to the fact of the voluntariness or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.712" offset="4902222">As this Court has said time and time again, the purpose behind the exclusion of every rule is to discourage the police from engaging into prohibited conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.097" offset="4947780">Prohibited conduct here is an investigatory detention upon less than probably cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.795" offset="4978604">The involuntary submission of the citizen to the custody in the police station, if the Fourth Amendment is to be protected in this conduct, in this context, the confessions obtained at the police station just by John Davis, his fingerprints in Davis case must be barred from evidence, whether they were voluntary or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.658" offset="5065958">The next step, of course, is that the Court not be willing to buy a rule based upon per se exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.762" offset="5098454">We then come to the question, was there the kind of attenuation between the initial police illegality, that is the seizure of Morales on the street corner and his confessions that would permit the Court to say that there has been a dissipation of the primary obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.201" offset="5156133">Again, the leading case is Wong Sun versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.202" offset="5176195">Their Blocky Toy was confession was excluded from evidence, were seized in his own premises made admissions almost immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.993" offset="5215378">Wong Sun took off, was at large for several days, then came back, and made his confessions, as to Wong Sun came to the primary illegality of any uncertain and unanticipated with, as to Blocky Toy as to Melvin Morales in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.570" offset="5269608">The link between the illegal police activity of seizing Morales without probable cause and taking him without his consent into the custody is so closely linked both in time and in circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.256" offset="5316420">Because Morales was taken down to the police station and interrogated almost immediately, the mere fact of interposition of, well, I think the properly called that that's point in time Escobedo warnings, should not by and off themselves be a sufficient attenuation of attained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.538" offset="5385488">The oppressiveness of the initial seizure was followed by the oppressiveness of the detention at the place selected by the police which was followed by the oppressiveness of the isolation from everyone else in the world but the police, which is followed in short order by the confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.296" offset="5448600">The link between these confessions and the seizure is so close both in time and in circumstances that I believe Your Honors that it cannot be reasonably said in the realistic appraisal of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.284" offset="5488515">That there has been a kind of attenuation between the unlawful police conduct in the first place violating the principles unasked by this Court less than seven months ago in Davis versus Mississippi and the confessions to say that the confessions are not the tainted produce of this initial police illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.466" offset="5569285">And further Your Honors, we submit that the confessions of the defendant, each and every one of them were not proven to be voluntary beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.395" offset="5620903">He did confess, he was one but he was a narcotics addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.690" offset="5634173">A group prone to beguiles to have a rather shallow perception of their rights and responsibilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.491" offset="6041370">He was so familiar with the kind of processes that he chose not to rely on the fact that it was unlawfully arrested, but he Morales that I'm speaking of Morales chose to rely on the stronger argument that is Fourth Amendment rights that was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.587" offset="6085674">Your Honors, I thought of that argument not both in Morales the experience to the criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.146" offset="6107930">The mere fact that he was 30 years of age, Your Honor, I submit, the fact that he had a rather extensive criminal record.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <label>Mr. Burton B. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="1549.977" offset="6303326">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.971" offset="6323284">Assuming there was no surrender here, assuming there was no surrender, in this case, and if there was a surrender, certainly the Fourth Amendment would not come into play. The taking of the custody, the detention, the seizure, the arrest, a Melvin Morales is under the circumstances of this case, was reasonable and appropriate within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.422" offset="6445014">The Fourth Amendment as oppose to the Fifth and Sixth Amendment applies a flexible and variable standard, it is not absolute like the Fifth and the Sixth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.110" offset="6503842">Guidelines have been provided by Terry against Ohio, and I submit that the people have the right to detain someone where there is a reasonable basis for belief that that individual has information concerning a crime which has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.487" offset="6613347">Justice Frankfurter stated, it much more adequately denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.182" offset="6632051">In Columbia, in which he said there are things which cannot speak and that it's necessary to detain and to interrogate witnesses who possibly maybe suspects in order to ascertain who has committee a particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.078" offset="6715643">This case like all cases appearing before this Court, there has to be a balancing between society and the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.795" offset="6750542">In this case, the petitioner whose counsel has characterized as a lamb was found by jury of his peers to have delivered 31 stab wounds to a 56-year-old woman in Bronx County, Mrs. Adi Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.715" offset="6842284">The police arriving upon, the same questioned individuals and before this investigation was over, they literally questioned over a hundred individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.530" offset="6901530">One information that they received that first night, they knew that the individual or possibly the individual committed this crime lived in that building because one of the tenants after the elevator arrived upon his floor heard footsteps below this particular floor and heard a door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.108" offset="6995780">They questioned individuals in the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.875" offset="7006856">They questioned Mrs. Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.474" offset="7017305">They questioned her son Snooky and the evidence indicates in the record is all we have to go on is that two individuals were interrogated by the police at the station house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.278" offset="7076446">Snooky, Snooky Morales and a man by the name of Shortie, they had no probable cause to arrest in a technical sense of the term either Snooky or Shortie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.729" offset="7138304">But I respectfully submit, conducting this investigation based on the information which they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.465" offset="7165262">They had a reasonable basis to detain and take him to the station house, these two individuals had questioned him and checked out their alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.217" offset="7200266">Ascertain whether or not these individuals could clear themselves in order to solve this crime involving Mrs. Adi Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.720" offset="7230255">They could never revive Mrs. Adi Brown but it was incumbent upon these police officers, characterized as petty public officials to work from day break to back break.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.704" offset="7282186">In order to solve this crime, so there would not be more Adi Browns, figuratively speaking, in Bronx County in the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.017" offset="7315414">They had to work, and they had to investigate, and they had to interrogate, and I respectfully submit, they went into the street and they knew these police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.990" offset="7359300">They knew Melvin Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.414" offset="7369017">They knew Melvin Morales to be a hustler and a petty thief who had numerous convictions as a narcotic addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.559" offset="7401618">As a policy, they knew this individual and they knew his haunts, and they looked in his haunts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.657" offset="7434010">And this individual was not seen in this familiar haunts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.420" offset="7457102">During the course of this investigation prior to the time that Melvin Morales was taken to the station house, they went and interviewed the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.662" offset="7498062">Detective Ferguson spoke to the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.476" offset="7509243">Detective Ferguson was told by the mother that her son was not around, that she had not seen her son for sometime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.966" offset="7559189">Subsequently, several days later, to Detective Carol and Detective Downe, when she discovered they was searching for her son and looking for her son.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.164" offset="7616031">She gave an alibi for her son.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.448" offset="7629197">She said, “He was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.999" offset="7639333">He was here in the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.096" offset="7651767">A detective had gone through the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.770" offset="7662425">A detective who knew Melvin Morales, he had not seen Melvin Morales in the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.720" offset="7690219">The little boy and his age doesn't appear on the record or in the record, was a little boy who had a Kombi, a van, and this little boy was walking his friend home at approximately 3:20 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.081" offset="7771721">And Everett Roberts according to the testimony in this record and I'm not going to comment on what the Assistant District Attorney stated concerning his testimony at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.556" offset="7821563">But that little boy described to the police prior to the time that Melvin Morales was detained or surrendered, described to the police and individual a receding hairline, a Puerto Rican, thin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.699" offset="7902124">And indeed the description matched in the minds of the detectives who are working on this case, Melvin Morales, and intensified their search for Melvin Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.888" offset="7954892">And this boy in Court identified Melvin Morales as the individual he saw at the time of a homicide and this little boy stated that he saw this individual on the day, on the Wednesday, following the Saturday night or Sunday morning that he saw the individual at the bench infront of this building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.549" offset="8049560">Now, the Court's notion, a probable cause is less than the conservative attitude of both prosecutor and police officials with regard to probable cause, as evidence by the Peters case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.375" offset="8120822">And I state to this Court, that if there was probable cause or this Court was able to find a probable cause from the Peters case or in the Peters case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.065" offset="8167633">Certainly, the Court may very well find from the record we have here, which we were not able to develop because the question of unreasonable detention was never raised in the trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.528" offset="8229491">It's not raised in the Appellate Division or at the immediate appellate court but was first raised, raised for the first time in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.051" offset="8267525">Certainly if it was raised, I respectfully submit, we'll have an opportunity to develop evidence and produce evidence which show how all of these information into hold and whether or not indeed, we had additional information which would enable us to have probable cause to make the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.693" offset="8354147">But I state that on the record itself, there was a reasonable basis which I contend is all at the Fourth Amendment requires, a reasonable basis to detain this individual in order to interrogate him and not because there was reasonable belief that he had information concerning the commission of this crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2133.058" offset="8635643">Substantiated in part by Melvin Morales himself when he testified and she said, “Melvin, Detective Carol wants to see you.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2171.392" offset="8788929">And at eight o'clock, the son arrived.</text>

            <text syncTime="2180.925" offset="8827068">The mother stated, “Come to the beauty parlor.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.733" offset="13518346">In conclusion, the people submit that the seizure was proper under the Fourth Amendment, that this man was seized not based solely or primarily on the fact that he was a narcotic addict but based on the fact that he was present in the vicinity at the time the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.324" offset="13604655">But a false alibi had been given for him by his mother that he was not found in the usual haunts, that he had a reputation of being a petty thief, who had numerous convictions, and was known to have numerous convictions by the detectives assigned on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.335" offset="13680724">Three, I respectfully submit that there was a voluntary surrender in this case and therefore the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.011" offset="13715414">They not even come into play with regard to the fact situation in case known as People of the State of New York against Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.582" offset="13761703">I would this ask this -- Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="3418.012" offset="13775391">Thank you, Mr. Roberts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard T. Farrell</label>
            <text syncTime="3424.795" offset="13802559">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.009" offset="13819382">Just very briefly, I like to return the Court's attention to two items of testimony that appear on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.539" offset="13841533">In spite of the intricate complex of facts upon which the police officers might have operated to seize Morales, we have summarized that our brief on pages 13 and 14 and over the 15th, the facts upon which they actually did operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.757" offset="13914363">They actually operated on a soonest of evidence, so slim that one police officer when asked whether Morales is a suspect or not, was led to this remark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.012" offset="13955427">He said, why is -- it was asked, was Morales a suspect?</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.452" offset="13973191">And after they have been given a lead by the trial judge, the officer said, I concur with the judge everybody is a suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.387" offset="14012897">The reach of the police officers here is not limited to Melvin Morales, but these petty officials to borrow I was wrong as from James Otis to speak in 1761.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.355" offset="14052812">The police officers here, these petty officials have it in their power to determine, who is the suspect and we know now from the police officer, who is the suspect?</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.007" offset="14091368">It is thee and me Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.835" offset="14102758">And the second point to which I would like to address the Court's attention was that the attack on the admissibility of Morales' confessions is not an attempt to find the way around otherwise, overwhelming proof of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.782" offset="14166497">Absent Morales' confessions, there is nothing to tie him to the crime committed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.348" offset="14188753">As a matter of fact to close that, it is clear that he was worrying on the night in question had been turned on a cleaning establishment on October 5th?</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.498" offset="14225324">To whom that the claiming stab wounds found no traces of blood on that clothes -- on those clothes and the police laboratory in examining those clothes found no traces of blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.987" offset="14263359">If Your Honors look at the pictures in the record from the scene of the crime, there is blood on the floor, there is blood on the wall, there is blood on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.573" offset="14301706">Morales' clothes showed no signs of blood and it is the people's own testimony that points to these clothes as the clothes being worn by Morales on the night this crime was supposed to have been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.150" offset="14355937">The only item of clothing missing were his shoes but his trousers, if you look at the pictures in the record, Your Honors, how his trousers could've escaped being covered with blood and door house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.635" offset="14409958">31-stabwound victim or alleged victim could not have bled on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.364" offset="14428871">It trenches upon almost a lack of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, absent these confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.111" offset="14459800">And Your Honors, as I think the Court will understand our position is that the confessions on the produce of an unlawful seizure and must therefore be barred from use on this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.447" offset="14505148">Thank you Your Honors.</text>
